         <title>Stereo&#8208; and Site&#8208;Selective Crotylation of Alcohol Proelectrophiles via Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Auto&#8208;Transfer Mediated by Methylallene and Butadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodide&#8208;bound ruthenium&#8208;JOSIPHOS complexes catalyze the redox&#8208;neutral C&#8208;C coupling of primary alcohols with methylallene (1,2&#8208;butadiene) or 1,3&#8208;butadiene to form products of  anti  &#8208;crotylation with good to excellent levels of diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Distinct from other methods, direct crotylation of primary alcohols in the presence of unprotected secondary alcohols is possible, enabling generation of spirastrellolide B (C9&#8208;C15) and leucascandrolide A (C9&#8208;C15) substructures in significantly fewer steps than previously possible.</dc:description>

         <title>Imaging Photoelectron Circular Dichroism in the Detachment of Mass&#8208;Selected Chiral Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectron Circular Dichroism (PECD) is a forward&#8208;backward asymmetry in the photoemission from a non&#8208;racemic sample induced by circularly polarized light. PECD spectroscopy has potential analytical advantages for chiral discrimination over other chiroptical methods due to its increased sensitivity to the chiral potential of the molecule. The use of anions for PECD spectroscopy allows for mass&#8208;selectivity and provides a path to simple experimental schemes that employ table&#8208;top light sources. Evidence of PECD for anions is limited, and insight into the forces that govern PECD electron dynamics in photodetachment is absent. Here, we demonstrate a PECD effect in the photodetachment of mass&#8208;selected deprotonated 1&#8208;indanol anions. By utilizing velocity map imaging photoelectron spectroscopy with a tunable light source, we determine the energy&#8208;resolved PECD over a wide range of photon energies. The observed PECD reaches up to 11%, similar to what has been measured for neutral species.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Engineering of Pyroelectric Crystals Decoupled from Piezoelectricity as Illustrated by Doped &#945;&#8208;Glycine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of pyroelectric crystals decoupled from piezoelectricity is not only a topic of scientific curiosity but also demonstrates effects in principle that have the potential to be technologically advantageous. Here we report a new method for the design of such materials. Thus, the co&#8208;doping of centrosymmetric crystals with tailor&#8208;made guest molecules, as illustrated by the doping of &#945;&#8208;glycine with different amino acids (Threonine, Alanine and Serine). The polarization of those crystals displays two distinct contributions, one arising from the difference in dipole moments between guest and host and the other from the displacement of host molecules from their symmetry&#8208;related positions. These contributions exhibit different temperature dependences and response to mechanical deformation. Thus, providing a  proof of concept  for the ability to design pyroelectric materials with reduced piezoelectric coefficient (d  22  ) to a minimal value, below the resolution limit of the method (&lt;0.005 pm/V)</dc:description>

         <title>Complexed Semiconductor Cores Activate Hexaniobate Ligands as Nucleophilic Sites for Solar&#8208;Light Reduction of CO2 by Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although pure and functionalized solid&#8208;state polyniobates such as layered perovskites and niobate nanosheets are photocatalysts for renewable&#8208;energy processes, analogous reactions by molecular polyoxoniobate cluster&#8208;anions are nearly absent from the literature. We now report that under simulated solar light, hexaniobate cluster&#8208;anion encapsulated 30&#8208;NiII&#8208;ion "fragments" of surface&#8208;protonated cubic&#8208;phase&#8208;like NiO cores activate the hexaniobate ligands towards CO2 reduction by water. Photoexcitation of the NiO cores promotes charge&#8208;transfer reduction of NbV to NbIV, increasing electron density at bridging oxo atoms of Nb&#8211;m&#8208;O&#8211;Nb linkages that bind and convert CO2 to CO. Photogenerated NiO &#8220;holes&#8221; simultaneously oxidize water to dioxygen. The findings point to molecular complexation of suitable semiconductor "fragments" as a general method for utilizing electron&#8208;dense polyoxoniobate anions as nucleophilic photocatalysts for solar&#8208;light driven activation and reduction of small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>PNP Ligands in Cobalt&#8208;Mediated Activation and Functionalization of White Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal mediated white phosphorus activation is of high interest as an ecological alternative to P  4&#160;  chlorination pathway to the practically useful phosphorus products. Herein, we report a facile approach for P  4&#160;  activation, transformation and subsequent functionalization using cobalt complexes bearing PNP ligands. The use of  N,N  &#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)amine as a ligand allows one to transform P  4&#160;  tetrahedron into a  zig&#8208;zag  chain with the formation of complex [Co(Ph  2  PNHP(Ph  2  )  PPPP  P(Ph  2  )NHPPh  2  )]BF  4  (  4  ). The presence of organic substituent at nitrogen atom in PNP ligand enables one to obtain complexes with &#951;  1  &#8208;coordinated P  4  molecule, which indicates the crucial role of N&#8208;H bond in transformation of white phosphorus tetrahedron. Additionally, complex  4&#160;  can readily be functionalized by means of the reaction with Ph  2  PCl leading to the formation of a new complex bearing unique P  9  &#8208;ligand. The obtained results provide opportunities for facile construction of new polyphosphorus ligands in the coordination sphere of transition metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deprotection&#8208;free method was developed for the synthesis of graphdiyne (GDY) powder with in situ formed CuO nanoparticles, as reported by Mohamed Nawfal Ghazzal, Li&#8208;Zhu Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202210242). The prepared CuO/GDY was demonstrated an excellent co&#8208;catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art Pt cocatalyst. The work will widen the use of GDY and facilitate its scaling up to industrial level.

         <title>Organogold(III) Complexes Display Conditional Photoactivities: Evolving From Photodynamic into Photoactivated Chemotherapy in Response to O2 Consumption for Robust Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;reactivity for robust tumor therapy: A PDT&#8208;to&#8208;PACT evolving photo&#8208;reactivity with response to oxygen&#8208;consumption was found in cyclometalated gold(III)&#8208;alkyne complexes, leading to potent cytotoxicity towards cancer cells, strong anti&#8208;angiogenesis in zebrafish, and efficient suppression of mouse tumor xenografts.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a spatiotemporally controllable, powerful approach in combating cancers but suffers from low activity under hypoxia, whereas photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) operates in an O2&#8208;independent manner but compromises the ability to harness O2 for potent photosensitization. Herein we report that cyclometalated gold(III)&#8208;alkyne complexes display a PDT&#8208;to&#8208;PACT evolving photoactivity for efficient cancer treatment. On the one hand, the gold(III) complexes can act as dual photosensitizers and substrates, leading to conditional PDT activity in oxygenated condition that progresses to highly efficient PACT (&#981; up to 0.63) when O2 is depleted in solution and under cellular environment. On the other hand, the conditional PDT&#8208;to&#8208;PACT reactivity can be triggered by external photosensitizers in a similar manner in vitro and in vivo, giving additional tumor&#8208;selectivity and/or deep tissue penetration by red&#8208;light irradiation that leads to robust anticancer efficacy.

         <title>Enantioselective [2+2] Cycloaddition of Allenyl Imide with Mono&#8208;, or Disubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalytic asymmetric [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of allenyl imide and alkenes was achieved by utilizing chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;magnesium(II) complex as the catalyst. This protocol provided a series of axially chiral cyclobutenes in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. A stepwise mechanism was proposed based on experimental studies and DFT calculations and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction was crucial for the enantioselectivity.







Abstract
An efficient catalytic asymmetric [2+2] cycloaddition of allenyl imide and mono&#8208; or disubstituted alkenes is disclosed. The key feature of this method is the use of bidentate allenyl imide and weakly activated and less steric hindered alkene pair by utilizing chiral magnesium(II) complex of N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide, which could provide through&#8208;space dispersion interactions to orientate the arrangement of the alkene. This protocol allows the generation of a series of axially chiral cyclobutenes and four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;containing spirocycles (80 examples) in high yield (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee), and the late&#8208;stage modification of biologically active molecules as well. Experimental studies and DFT calculations revealed that this [2+2] cycloaddition proceeded via a stepwise mechanism involving a short&#8208;lived zwitterionic intermediate. The &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between the alkenes and the amide moiety in the ligand was crucial for the enantiocontrol.

         <title>Catalytic and Stereoselective Transformations with Easily Accessible and Purchasable Allyl and Alkenyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review analyzes recent advances regarding the preparation of complex and stereochemically defined fluoro&#8208;organic molecules by routes originating from purchasable or readily accessible alkenyl and allylic fluorides. The untapped potential of other, far less explored, commercially available organofluorine compounds as launching points for the development of stereoselective processes that may be valuable to drug discovery is underscored.







Abstract
Stereochemically defined organofluorine compounds are vital to drug discovery and many applicable catalytic strategies have been introduced for accessing these entities stereoselectively. One approach entails incorporation of a fluorine atom (C&#8722;F bond formation) or an organofluorine moiety (e.g., CF3 or CF2H), and another exploits commercially available compounds with one or more fluorine atoms. Here, we present the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art regarding the use of alkenyl and allylic fluorides in preparation of stereochemically defined fluoro&#8208;organic molecules. Allylic and alkenyl fluorides may be purchased or generated from a commercially available acid, carboxylate salt, ester, aldehyde hydrate, or ketone bearing several fluorine atoms next to a carbonyl group. We underscore the untapped potential of purchasable organofluorine compounds, many allylic and alkenyl fluorides, as launching points for development of stereoselective processes that are of value to therapeutic science.

         <title>Vibration&#8208;Assisted Charge Transport through Positively Charged Dimer Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimer single&#8208;molecule junction with positively charged units is constructed through host&#8211;guest interaction using graphene&#8208;based static molecular junctions. A transition mechanism from temperature&#8208;independent coherent tunneling to temperature&#8208;dependent incoherent transport is observed, which is caused by thermally&#8208;induced specific molecular vibration modes. The introduction of positive charge can improve the incoherent transport process.







Abstract
Intermolecular charge transport plays a vital role in the fields of electronics, as well as biochemical systems. Here, we design supramolecular dimer junctions and investigate the effects of charge state and energy level alignment on charge transport under nanoconfinement. Incoherent tunneling caused by thermally&#8208;induced vibrations is enhanced in positively charged systems. The transition between coherent and incoherent tunneling is associated with specific molecular vibration modes. Positively charged systems with smaller torsional barriers and vibrational frequencies result in lower transition temperatures. Multiple thermal effects have a great impact on the conductance in the off&#8208;resonant tunneling, while thermally&#8208;induced vibron&#8208;assisted tunneling contributes more to the transport in the resonant tunneling. These investigations offer a deep mechanism understanding of intermolecular charge transport and facilitate the development of practical functional molecular devices.

         <title>Human Cyclophilin B Nuclease Activity Revealed via Nucleic Acid&#8208;Based Electrochemical Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs electrochemical DNA&#8208;based sensors to investigate the hydrolytic activity of a previously unknown nuclease, cyclophilin B. The protein is secreted by pancreatic cancer cells and could be a biomarker for early&#8208;stage cancer diagnoses. However, the demonstrated nuclease activity will limit bioassay development based on natural nucleic acid aptamers. Instead, we propose DNA stereoisomers (l&#8208;DNA) to overcome this challenge.







Abstract
Human cyclophilin B (CypB) is oversecreted by pancreatic cancer cells, making it a potential biomarker for early&#8208;stage disease diagnosis. Our group is motivated to develop aptamer&#8208;based assays to measure CypB levels in biofluids. However, human cyclophilins have been postulated to have collateral nuclease activity, which could impede the use of aptamers for CypB detection. To establish if CypB can hydrolyze electrode&#8208;bound nucleic acids, we used ultrasensitive electrochemical sensors to measure CypB's hydrolytic activity. Our sensors use ssDNA and dsDNA in the biologically predominant d&#8208;DNA form, and in the nuclease resistant l&#8208;DNA form. Challenging such sensors with CypB and control proteins, we unequivocally demonstrate that CypB can cleave nucleic acids. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use electrochemical biosensors to reveal the hydrolytic activity of a protein that is not known to be a nuclease. Future development of CypB bioassays will require the use of nuclease&#8208;resistant aptamer sequences.

         <title>Multistate Circularly Polarized Luminescence Switching through Stimuli&#8208;Induced Co&#8208;Conformation Regulations of Pyrene&#8208;Functionalized Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise co&#8208;conformation regulation of topologically chiral [2]catenanes under two different external stimuli led to the construction of a bidirectional circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switch, as reported by Xiao He, Wei Wang and Hai&#8208;Bo Yang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202210542). The results provide not only an attractive approach toward the construction of multistate CPL switches for practical uses but also a promising platform for the construction of novel chiral materials.

         <title>An&#160;Ultraviolet Fluorophore with Narrowed Emission via Coplanar Molecular Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Narrowband emitting fluorophores exhibit immense potentials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity. However, it&#8217;s still hard to simultaneously realize short&#8208;wavelength ultraviolet (UV) or near ultraviolet emission (NUV) while maintaining a narrowed full width at half maximum (FWHM) value, and rare work focus on such challenging pursuit. Herein, an ingenious synthetic method was devised to achieve emitters with coplanar structure. 11&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)indolo[3,2,1&#8208;  jk  ]carbazole (ICZ&#8208;TAZ) was designed to realize narrowed UV emission both in photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) which benefited from the suppression of vibronic coupling. UV/NUV OLEDs based on ICZ&#8208;TAZ achieve external quantum efficiency (EQE) maximums of 3.26% peaks @ 388 nm and 4.02 % peaks @ 406 nm with small FWHM of 32 nm and 46 nm, respectively, corresponding with reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off at luminance of 100 cd m  &#8208;2  .</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Molecular Porters of Surface Mounted Ru&#8208;Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ru&#8208;porphyrins act as convenient pedestals for the assembly of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) on solid surfaces. Upon deposition of a simple NHC ligand on a close packed Ru&#8208;porphyrin monolayer, an extraordinary phenomenon can be observed: Ru&#8208;porphyrin molecules are transferred from the silver surface to the next molecular layer. We have investigated the structural features and dynamics of this portering process and analyzed the associated binding strengths and work function changes. A rearrangement of the molecular layer is induced by the NHC uptake: the NHC selective binding to the Ru atoms causes the ejection of whole porphyrin molecules from the molecular layer on silver to the layer on top. This reorganization can be reversed by thermally induced desorption of the NHC ligand. We anticipate that the understanding of such mass transport processes will have crucial implications for the functionalization of surfaces with carbenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress in Hydrogen Production Coupled with Electrochemical Oxidation of Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical oxidation of small molecules to generate value&#8208;added products has gained enormous interest in recent years due to the advantages of benign operation conditions, high conversion efficiency and selectivity, the absence of external oxidizing agents, and eco&#8208;friendly. Moreover, small molecule oxidation reactions can serve as promising substitutes to replace the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems, such as hydrogen production and CO2 reduction. Coupling electrochemical oxidation of small molecules at the anode and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode in an electrolyser would simultaneously realize high value chemicals generation or pollutant degradation and high&#8208;efficient hydrogen production. In recent years, various thermodynamically more favorable small molecules oxidation reactions have been designed as promising alternatives to OER to achieve highly efficient hydrogen production. In this Minireview, we present a brief introduction about small molecule choice and design strategies of electrocatalysts. Furthermore, we highlight the discussion about recent breakthroughs in small molecule oxidation assisted highly efficient hydrogen production, including alternative molecules, modulated strategies of catalysts, and related catalytic reaction mechanisms in small molecule oxidation reactions. Finally, a perspective on possible challenges and future orientations of small molecule oxidation is presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetrically substituted 10H,10'H&#8208;9,9'&#8208;spirobi[acridine] derivatives as hole&#8208;transporting materials for perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) based on the 10  H  , 10'H&#8208;9,9'&#8208;spirobi [acridine] core (  BSA50  and  BSA51  ) were synthesized, and their electronic and hole transportation properties were explored. Experimental and theoretical studies show that the presence of rigid 3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole moieties in  BSA 50  brings about improved hole mobility, and higher work function (lower HOMO level) compared to bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amine units in  BSA51  , which increase interfacial hole transportation from the perovskite to the HTM. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on  BSA50  exhibit higher  V  oc  and FF than those with  BSA51  , boosting power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 22.65%, which is close to the value obtained in spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8208;based devices (23.37%). Owing to the higher hydrophobicity of  BSA50  and its effective defect passivation, unencapsulated PSCs exhibit superior stability to devices employing spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, retaining nearly 90% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h operation output. A perovskite solar module using  BSA50  HTM exhibits a PCE of 21.35% (6.5 &#215; 7 cm) with a  J  sc  of 3.08 mA cm  &#8208;2  ,  V  oc  of 8.761 V and FF of 79.1%. This work demonstrates the high potential of molecularly engineered spirobi[acridine] derivatives as HTMs as replacements of spiro&#8208;OMeTAD.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Interaction on Diatomic Catalysts Boosting Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the simultaneous presence of two metal active centres, some special interactions occur between active sites in diatomic catalysts (DACs). Such interactions play an important role in determining the rate and selectivity of the reaction, denoted as long&#8208;range interaction (LRI). The right combination must be screened and clarified to achieve the targeted efficiency. To date, various types of DACs have been synthesised and applied in electrochemistry. However, the LRI has not been systematically summarised. Herein, the regulation, mechanism and electrocatalytic applications of LRI are comprehensively summarised and discussed. In addition to the basic information above, the challenges, opportunities, and future development of LRI on DACs are proposed to present an overall view and reference for future research.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanded Sequence Space of Radical&#160;S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine&#8208;Dependent Enzymes Involved in Post&#8208;translational Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) represent one of the largest but primarily underexplored natural product families in bacteria. The genetically encoded nature of RiPPs simplifies the prediction and prioritization of their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). We report a small peptide and enzyme co&#8208;occurrence analysis workflow (SPECO), which allowed us to identify 32,220 prospective rSAM&#8208;catalyzed RiPP BGCs from 161,954 bacterial genomes and prioritize 25 families with new biosynthetic architectures or precursor patterns. We characterized three new enzymes that respectively catalyze cysteine&#8208;glycine (BlaB), histidine&#8208;aliphatic side chain (ScaB), and tyrosine/histidine&#8208;arginine (VguB) cross&#8208;links. The cyclophane&#8208;forming enzyme ScaB exhibits broad substrate selectivity, allowing it to catalyze diverse triceptide formation. These results demonstrate the strength of the SPECO workflow in discovering new enzymes for peptide macrocyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Sonication&#8208;Activated Valence&#8208;Variable Sono&#8208;Sensitizer/Catalyst for Autography Inhibition/Ferroptosis&#8208;Induced Tumor Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effective deployment of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated oncotherapy in practice remains challenging, mired by uncontrollable catalytic processes, stern reaction conditions and safety concerns. Herein, we develop a copper nanodot integrating sonodynamic and catalytic effects within one active center, which responds to exogenous ultrasound (US) and endogenous H2O2 stimuli.&#160;US irradiation induces the valence conversion from Cu(II) to Cu(I) catalyzing H2O2 into &#8226;OH for chemodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, valence transformation results in electron&#8208;hole pairs separation, promoting ROS generation for sonodynamic therapy. Notably, copper nanodots not only block lysosome fusion and degradation leading to autophagy flux blockage, but also interfere with the glutathione peroxidase 4 and cystine&#8208;glutamate antiporter SLC7A11 function achieving ferroptosis. Furthermore, reversible valence changes, inherent hydrophilicity and renal clearance ultrasmall size guarantee biosafety.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Stable Anion&#8208;Tuned Electrode/Electrolyte Interphase on High&#8208;Voltage Na3V2(PO4)2F3 Cathode for Thermally&#8208;Modulated Fast&#8208;Charging Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing stable electrode/electrolyte interphase with fast interfacial kinetics is vital for fast&#8208;charging batteries. Herein, we investigate the interphase that forms between a high&#8208;voltage Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode and the electrolytes consisting of 3.0, 1.0, or 0.3 M NaClO4 in an organic carbonate solvent (47.5:47.5:5 mixture of EC: PC: FEC) during charging up to 4.5 V at 55oC. It is found that a higher anion/solvent ratio in electrolyte solvation structure induces anion&#8208;dominated interphase containing more inorganic species and more anion derivatives (CxClOy), which leads to a larger interfacial Na+ transport resistance and more unfavorable gas evolution. In comparison, a low anion/solvent ratio derives stable anion&#8208;tuned interphase that enables better interfacial kinetics and cycle ability. Importantly, the performance of a failed cathode is restored by triggering the decomposition of CxClOy species. This work elucidates the role of tuning interphase in fast&#8208;charging batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Iodine Uptake by a Molecular Host&#8226;Guest Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>recently, porous organic crystals (POC) based on macrocycles have shown exceptional sorption and separation properties. Yet, the impact of guest presence inside a macrocycle prior to adsorption has not been studied. Here we show that the inclusion of trimethoxybenzyl&#8208;azaphosphatrane in the macrocycle cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) affords molecular Porous Host&#8226;Guest Crystals (PHGC&#8208;1) featured by radically new properties. Unactivated hydrated PHGC&#8208;1 adsorbed iodine spontaneously and selectively at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The absence of (i) heat for material synthesis, (ii) moisture sensitivity and (iii) energy&#8208;intensive steps for pore activation are attractive attributes for decrease of energetic costs. 1H NMR and DOSY were instrumental to monitor the H2O/I2 exchange. Finally, PHGC&#8208;1 are non&#8208;centrosymmetric and I2 doped crystals showed markedly different Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) suggesting that iodine doping could be used to modulate the non&#8208;linear optical properties of porous organic crystals.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
The bi&#8208;polaron transport and magnetic field induced Pauli spin&#8208;blockade were revealed in redox&#8208;active molecules molecular junctions (MJs), as evidenced by the magnetoresistance (MR) effect, which may bring new magnetic&#8208;electronic functionality to the molecular scale electronic devices.







Abstract
We report the bi&#8208;polaron transport and magnetic field induced Pauli spin&#8208;blockade in solid&#8208;state molecular junctions (MJs) evidenced by a positive magnetoresistance (MR). The junction was made of thin layers of redox&#8208;active ruthenium polypyridyl&#8208;oligomers Ru(tpy)2 sandwiched between conducting amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) electrodes. The redox&#8208;active Ru(tpy)2 molecule, which enables small polaron and deep traps in the charge transport of the Ru(tpy)2 MJ as revealed by the temperature&#8208;dependent current&#8211;voltage response, leads to the formation of the bi&#8208;polaron and magnetic field induced Pauli spin blockade, resulting into the MR. At the meantime, the reliable and controllable device performance renders a rigid thickness&#8208;dependent MR evolution. The bi&#8208;polaron transport revealed in our study underscores the importance of the multi&#8208;particle transport by molecular design in MJs and laid the foundation for magnetic&#8208;electronic function in molecular&#8208;scale devices.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FSCV) Reveals Behaviorally Evoked Dopamine Release by Sugar Feeding in the Adult Drosophila Mushroom Body</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vivo fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry was developed to measure behaviorally evoked dopamine release in the mushroom body of adult Drosophila melanogaster during sugar feeding. Sugar feeding stimulated robust dopamine release and its release was pharmacologically characterized. Dopamine release was increased after applying flupentixol and nisoxetine, demonstrating D2 receptors and dopamine transporters mediate sugar&#8208;evoked dopamine signaling.







Abstract
Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, is an excellent model organism for studying dopaminergic mechanisms and simple behaviors, but methods to measure dopamine during behavior are needed. Here, we developed fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) to track in vivo dopamine during sugar feeding. First, we employed acetylcholine stimulation to evaluate the feasibility of in vivo measurements in an awake fly. Next, we tested sugar feeding by placing sucrose solution near the fly proboscis. In the mushroom body medial tip, 1&#8197;pmol acetylcholine and sugar feeding released 0.49&#177;0.04&#8197;&#956;M and 0.31&#177;0.06&#8197;&#956;M dopamine, respectively but sugar&#8208;evoked release lasted longer than with acetylcholine. Administering the dopamine transporter inhibitor nisoxetine or D2 receptor antagonist flupentixol significantly increased sugar&#8208;evoked dopamine. This study develops FSCV to measure behaviorally evoked release in fly, enabling Drosophila studies of neurochemical control of reward, learning, and memory behaviors.

         <title>The Linkage of Sulfonimidoyl Fluorides and Unactivated Alkenes via Hydrosulfonimidoylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free linkage chemistry of unactivated alkenes and sulfonimidoyl fluorides via hydrosulfonimidoylation to construct sulfoximines within minutes is presented. An intermolecular hydride transfer process is the key step in the reaction.







Abstract
Sulfur(VI) fluoride cleavage and exchanging linkage, a new generation of linkage chemistry, exhibits enormous potential for combining a range of functional molecules in an increasing number of fields. Herein, we established a metal&#8208;free linkage of unactivated alkenes and sulfonimidoyl fluorides via hydrosulfonimidoylation to construct sulfoximines within minutes. An intermolecular hydride transfer process is the key step, and it occurs via overlap of the LUMO in the sulfonimidoyl cation and HOMO in the unactivated alkene, which was confirmed via control experiments with deuterated compounds. DFT calculations further demonstrated the concerted process involving formation of the S&#8722;C(sp3) bond and hydride transfer. Remarkably, abundant natural products and pharmaceuticals with multiple heteroatoms and sensitive functional groups have been subjected to the current linkage reaction to achieve various sulfoximine linkages, furnishing the basis for drug discovery and drug conjugation.

A novel dual&#8208;network structured hydrogel realizes stable and rechargeable solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air/iodide hybrid batteries.







Abstract
As a key component of batteries, the electrolyte determines the ion transport and interface chemistry of the cathode and anode. In this work, we develop a dual&#8208;network structured hydrogel electrolyte composed of polyacrylamide (PAM), sodium alginate (SA) and potassium iodide (KI) for solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air/iodide hybrid batteries. The assembled hybrid battery shows excellent renewability and a long cycling life of 110&#8197;h with a high energy efficiency of 80&#8201;%. The ion&#8208;crosslinked dual&#8208;network structure endows the material with improved mechanical strength and increased ionic conductivity. More importantly, the introduction of iodine species not only offers more favorable cathodic kinetics of iodide/iodate redox than oxygen electrocatalysis but also regulates the solvation structure of zinc ions to ensure better interface stability. This work provides significant concepts for developing novel solid&#8208;state electrolytes to realize high&#8208;performance energy devices and technologies.

         <title>Tracking Hepatic Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury in Real Time with a Reversible NIR&#8208;IIb Fluorescent Redox Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible fluorescent redox probe with emission beyond 1500&#8197;nm was synthesized to dynamically monitor the time&#8208;resolved reactive oxygen species (ROS) fluctuations during hepatic ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (HIRI) in vivo. The strategy not only circumvents the difficulty in building reversible fluorescent probes in the NIR&#8208;II region but also offers a useful tool for early diagnosis and timely treatment of HIRI.







Abstract
Hepatic ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (HIRI) is responsible for liver dysfunction, which involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the most critical marker. Real&#8208;time monitoring of ROS during HIRI can provide significant chance for early diagnosis and timely intervention. However, there is no probe available to track ROS fluctuations during HIRI in vivo, as it is extremely challenging to design reversibly responsive fluorescent probe in near&#8208;infrared region. Here, a reversible redox probe REPOMs emitting beyond 1500&#8197;nm is proposed to fill the blank, using rare earth ions&#8208;doped nanoparticles as emitter, and molybdenum&#8208;based polyoxometalate nanoclusters as the ROS&#8208;recognition site and emission modulator. REPOMs exhibited excellent response towards the repeated cycle between ROS and glutathione, based on which the time&#8208;resolved ROS changes during HIRI were successfully obtained. This reversible probe may provide a powerful tool to promote the hepatology research in the future.

         <title>A Proton Conductive Porous Framework of an 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6&#8208;Ether Derivative Networked by Rigid Hydrogen Bonding Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework (HOF) was constructed from a 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether (18C6) derivative. Although a 18C6 macrocycle is flexible and has many possible conformations, directional intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonds of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl modules in the periphery of the 18C6 allowed to form a rigid HOF with 1D channels with bottleneck composed of 18C6 rings.

A rigid hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) was constructed from a C3&#8208;symmetric hexatopic carboxylic acid with a hydrophilic 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether (18C6) component. Despite the flexible macrocyclic structure with many conformations, the derivative with three 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl moieties in the periphery yielded a rigid layered porous framework through directional intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Interestingly, the HOF possesses 1D channels with bottleneck composed of 18C6 rings. The HOF shows proton conductivity (1.12&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) through Grotthuss mechanism (Ea=0.27&#8197;eV) under 98&#8201;%RH. The present unique water channel structure provides an inspiration to create molecular porous materials.

&lt;p&gt;A porous hydrogen-bonded framework (HOF) was constructed from a 18-crown-6-ether (18C6) derivative. Although a 18C6 macrocycle is flexible and has many possible conformations, directional intermolecular hydrogen-bonds of 4,4&#8242;-dicarboxy-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-terphenyl modules in the periphery of the 18C6 allowed to form a rigid HOF with 1D channels with bottleneck composed of 18C6 rings. The wet HOF shows proton conductivity (1.12&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) through Grotthuss mechanism (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Oxidative Radical NHC Catalysis: Divergent Difunctionalization of Olefins through Intermolecular Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented oxidative radical NHC catalytic system is reported that allows an efficient difunctionalization of olefins for the divergent synthesis of various ketones. Key to success is the use of peroxyesters as &#8220;dual&#8208;role&#8221; reagents to achieve a sequential single&#8208;electron oxidation and intermolecular hydron atom transfer.







Abstract
Oxidative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis, typically leading to the formation of acyl azolium reactive intermediates, constitutes one of the most important activation strategies for the NHC&#8208;catalyzed chemical transformations. Here, we report an unprecedented oxidative radical NHC catalysis by using peroxyester as the external single&#8208;electron oxidant to realize divergent difunctionalization of olefins. The key to success of this chemistry is the catalytic generation of oxygen radicals that could trigger an intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer to activate the inert C&#8722;H bonds, thereby enabling the productive radical relay process. With this protocol, commonly used general chemicals could serve as radical precursors to allow efficient synthesis of value&#8208;added products in a straightforward and cost&#8208;effective manner. Preliminary mechanistic investigations, including control experiments and DFT calculations, shed light on the NHC organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.

         <dc:description>
A combination of photoredox catalysis and energy transfer catalysis/direct photo&#8208;excitation enables cascade reactions of cyclopropanols and &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;olefins, in which two rings and three bonds are constructed in one reaction, affording fused gem&#8208;difluorooxetanes. The reaction shows broad substrate scope, complete cis&#8208;selectivity, and downstream transformations of the products demonstrated the synthetic potential.







Abstract
Fluorinated fused rings are challenging to construct from simple starting materials. Herein, we report the first photocatalyzed cascade reactions of readily available cyclopropanols and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted olefins for the synthesis of fused gem&#8208;difluorooxetanes. Two rings and three bonds were efficiently constructed in one reaction. The reaction showed broad substrate scope and the downstream transformations of the products demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction. The mechanistic study supported the presence of cascade photoredox catalysis and energy transfer catalysis/direct photo&#8208;excitation processes.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Preparation of Twisted Graphene Nanoribbons by Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly twisted and fully armchair&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) have been synthesized by Cu&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative coupling. These twisted AGNRs have lengths up to 2.65&#8197;nm and display strong emission with a fluorescence quantum yield up to 81&#8201;%.







Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are promising in organic optoelectronic materials, and their properties largely depend on the size, edge, and conformation. Herein, the fully armchair&#8208;edged GNRs (AGNRs) with lengths up to 2.65&#8197;nm by using a Cu&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative coupling as a key step. The resulting AGNRs (2HBT, 3HBT, and 4HBT) possess highly twisted &#960;&#8208;scaffolds, and the torsion angles between the adjacent triphenylene moieties are larger than 32&#176;, as proved by crystallographic analyses. Theoretical and spectroscopic studies show that the butoxy groups endow AGNRs with electron&#8208;rich features, the extension of the &#960;&#8208;system from 2HBT to 4HBT reinforces S0&#8594;S1 excitation, and the distortion of the &#960;&#8208;scaffold enhances the fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F). In particular, 4HBT has the lowest oxidation potential (Eox1=0.55&#8197;V vs. SCE) and displays red fluorescence with a &#934;F value of 81&#8201;%.

         <title>Rapid and Economical Chemoselective Metabolomics Using Boronate Ester Formation on a Monolithic Substrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and economical chemoselective labeling strategy was established involving a boronate ester reaction on a monolithic substrate. Only 15&#8197;minutes is required to complete the strategy and boron allows for recognition of labeled metabolites with no need for expensive additional isotopic encoding. The sensitivity was enhanced up to 1&#8201;600 times compared with non&#8208;labeled liquid chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry methods.







Abstract
Although chemoselective labeling strategies show great potential in in&#8208;depth description of metabolomics, the associated time and expense limit applications in high&#8208;throughput and routine analysis. We report a fast and effective chemoselective labeling strategy based on multifunctionalized monolithic probes. A rapid pH&#8208;responsive boronate ester reaction was employed to immobilize and release probe molecules from substrate in 5&#8197;min. The mesoporous surface and hierarchically porous channels of the substrate allowed for accelerated labeling reactions. Moreover, the discernible boron beacons allowed for recognition of labeled metabolites with no need for expensive isotopic encoding. This new strategy has been successfully used for submetabolome analysis of yeast cells, serum, and faeces samples, with improved sensitivity for short chain fatty acids up to 1&#8201;600 times compared with non&#8208;labeled liquid chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS) methods.

         <title>Silicon Catalyzed C&#8722;O Bond Ring Closing Metathesis of Polyethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis superacid bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane is applied in the selective catalytic C&#8722;O ring&#8208;closing metathesis of challenging oligo&#8208; and polyethers, enabling upcycling of polyethylene glycol. Based on detailed investigations of the reaction mechanism by DFT calculations, an improved second&#8208;generation silicon&#8208;based Lewis superacid is developed.







Abstract
The Lewis superacid bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane catalyzes C&#8722;O bond metathesis of alkyl ethers with an efficiency outperforming all earlier reported systems. Chemoselective ring contractions of macrocyclic crown ethers enable substrate&#8208;specific transformations, and an unprecedented ring&#8208;closing metathesis of polyethylene glycols allows polymer&#8208;selective degradation. Quantum chemical computations scrutinize a high Lewis acidity paired with a simultaneous low propensity for polydentate substrate binding as critical for successful catalysis. Based on these mechanistic insights, a second&#8208;generation class of silicon Lewis superacid with enhanced efficacy is identified and demonstrated.

         <title>A Bifunctional CdS/MoO2/MoS2 Catalyst Enhances Photocatalytic H2 Evolution and Pyruvic Acid Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated electrons and holes in CdS hollow spheres loaded with MoS2 and MoO2 dual cocatalysts are applied to hydrogen evolution and selective pyruvic acid production, respectively. This bifunctional strategy can fully utilize the redox abilities of photogenerated electrons and holes to enhance photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The best use of photogenerated electrons and holes is crucial to boosting photocatalytic activity. Herein, a bifunctional dual&#8208;cocatalyst&#8208;modified photocatalyst is constructed based on CdS/MoO2/MoS2 hollow spheres for hydrogen evolution coupled with selective pyruvic acid (PA) production from lactic acid (LA) oxidation. MoS2 and MoO2 are simultaneously obtained from the conversion of CdMoO4 in one step. In a photocatalytic process, the MoS2 and MoO2 function as the reduction and oxidation centers on which photogenerated electrons and holes accumulate and are used for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and PA synthesis, respectively. By monitoring the intermediates, a two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron route for PA production is proposed, initiated by the cleavage of the &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in the LA. The conversion of LA and the selectivity of PA can reach ca. 29&#8201;% and 95&#8201;% after a five&#8208;hour reaction, respectively.

         <title>2,4,6&#8208;Trimethylpyridine&#8208;Derived Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Confined Catalytic Esterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Knoevenagel condensation at the methyl groups of a 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridine monomer was promoted by in situ acylation of the nitrogen atom, yielding highly crystalline vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks. The resultant Lewis basic, pyridine&#8208;decorated, regular, nanoporous structures catalyzed spatially confined organic esterification with good selectivity.







Abstract
Knoevenagel condensation is a powerful tool for the construction of vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks. Herein, we established a concise approach to vinylene&#8208;linked COFs by Knoevenagel condensation at the multi&#8208;methyl groups of a pyridine ring through in situ formation of an N&#8208;acyl pyridinium cation in the presence of various acylating reagents. Following this strategy, two vinylene&#8208;linked COFs were constructed using 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridine and multi&#8208;aldehyde&#8208;substituted aromatic derivatives as monomers. The resultant COFs are highly crystalline and assembled into hexagonal lattices with specific surface areas as large as 1915&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 (vs. 1972&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 of the theoretical value). The stable and abundant pyridine&#8208;decorated regular nanochannels within the COFs allow for catalyzing the esterification of several pharmaceutical intermediates with distinct spatially confined selectivity and recyclability, representing an environmentally friendly catalytic organic transformation.

         <title>Dramatically Enhanced Reactivity of Fullerenes and Tetrazine towards the Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction inside a Porous Porphyrinic Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a dramatic enhancement in the reactivity of fullerenes (C60/C70)&#8208;tetrazine reaction inside a porous Zn&#8208;porphyrinic cage (Zn&#8208;PB) under sustainable conditions. Moreover, hydration&#8208;induced rearrangement of C60&#8208;LA inside Zn&#8208;PB facilitates its release from the Zn&#8208;PB cavity, thus enabling Zn&#8208;PB to catalyze fullerene&#8208;pyrazoline adduct without product inhibition.







Abstract
Inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction (IEDDA) between fullerenes and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine generally requires harsh conditions and long reaction times due to their strong electron&#8208;accepting nature. Herein, we report a dramatic enhancement in the reactivity of the fullerenes (C60/C70)&#8208;tetrazine reaction inside a porous Zn&#8208;porphyrinic cage (Zn&#8208;PB) under sustainable conditions by installing a tetrazine&#8208;based axle (LA) via metal&#8208;ligand coordination bond, which modulates the cavity size to facilitate the encapsulation of fullerenes. Upon encapsulation, the close proximity of fullerenes and the tetrazine group of LA dramatically increase their reactivity towards the IEDDA reaction to form fullerene&#8208;tetrazine adducts. Furthermore, the C60&#8208;tetrazine adduct is rearranged upon hydration to a bent&#8208;shaped C60&#8208;pyrazoline adduct that can be released from the Zn&#8208;PB cavity in the presence of excess LA, thus catalyzing the formation of C60&#8208;pyrazoline adduct inside Zn&#8208;PB without product inhibition.

         <title>Synergistic Interfacial Bonding in Reduced Graphene Oxide Fiber Cathodes Containing Polypyrrole@sulfur Nanospheres for Flexible Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a synergistic interface bonding strategy to construct novel flexible fiber&#8208;shaped composite cathodes, in which polypyrrole@sulfur (PPy@S) nanospheres (&#8776;500&#8197;nm) are homogeneously implanted into the built&#8208;in cavity of self&#8208;assembled reduced graphene oxide fibers (rGOFs) by a facile microfluidic assembly method. The PPy@S/rGOFs cathode exhibits good mechanical property, excellent electronic conductivity and enhanced cycling performance and outstanding high&#8208;rate capacity.







Abstract
Flexible lithium sulfur batteries with high energy density and good mechanical flexibility are highly desirable. Here, we report a synergistic interface bonding enhancement strategy to construct flexible fiber&#8208;shaped composite cathodes, in which polypyrrole@sulfur (PPy@S) nanospheres are homogeneously implanted into the built&#8208;in cavity of self&#8208;assembled reduced graphene oxide fibers (rGOFs) by a facile microfluidic assembly method. In this architecture, sulfur nanospheres and lithium polysulfides are synergistically hosted by carbon and polymer interface, which work together to provide enhanced interface chemical bonding to endow the cathode with good adsorption ability, fast reaction kinetics, and excellent mechanical flexibility. Consequently, the PPy@S/rGOFs cathode shows enhanced electrochemical performance and high&#8208;rate capability. COMSOL Multiphysics simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are conducted to elucidate the enhanced electrochemical performance. In addition, a flexible Li&#8722;S pouch cell is assembled and delivers a high areal capacity of 5.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Our work offers a new strategy for preparation of advanced cathodes for flexible batteries.

In addition, a flexible Li&#8722;S pouch cell is assembled and delivers a high areal capacity of 5.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Our work offers a new strategy for preparation of advanced cathodes for flexible batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The First Chiro&#8208;Inositol Organosilicon Ferroelectric Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;component organosilicon ferroelectric D&#8208;chiro&#8208;inositol&#8208;SiMe3 is designed by using the chemical strategy of introducing quasi&#8208;spherical [&#8208;Si(CH3)3] groups into D&#8208;chiro&#8208;inositol. It exhibits the stable and electrically switchable spontaneous polarization on the thin film, which has extremely low hardness of 72.8&#8197;MPa and small elastic modulus of 5.04&#8197;GPa.







Abstract
Organosilicons have been used extensively in aerospace, electronics, food, medicine and other fields, due to their low viscosity, hydrophobicity, corrosion resistance, non&#8208;toxic, and physiologically inert features. Despite extensive interest, however, organosilicon ferroelectric crystals have never been found. Here, by using the chemical design strategy, we successfully obtained a molecular ferroelectric D&#8208;chiro&#8208;inositol&#8208;SiMe3 with polar P43 symmetry, whose spontaneous polarization can be electrically switchable on thin film. The introduction of organosilicon groups endows the thin films with excellent softness, ductility and flexibility (extremely low hardness of 72.8&#8197;MPa and small elastic modulus of 5.04&#8197;GPa) that are desirable for biomedical and human&#8208;compatible applications. As the first case of organosilicon ferroelectric crystal to date, this work offers a new structural paradigm for molecular ferroelectrics, and highlights their potential for flexible bio&#8208;electronic applications.

         <title>3D Blockage Mapping for Identifying Familial Point Mutations in Single Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Peptides with a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of single&#8208;point mutants of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide associated with familial Alzheimer's disease were simultaneously identified with aerolysin nanopores assisted by a 3D blockage mapping strategy. This is based on the combination of the conventional current blockage (Ib/I0), duration time (tD) and the reliable standard deviation of current blockade fluctuations (&#963;b).







Abstract
Accurate discrimination of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides containing familial point mutations would advance the knowledge of their roles in early&#8208;onset Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we simultaneously identified the mutant A21G, E22G, E22Q, and the wild&#8208;type (WT) A&#946;18&#8211;26 peptides with aerolysin nanopore using a 3D blockage mapping strategy. The standard deviation of current blockade fluctuations (&#963;b) was proposed as a new supplement to current blockage (Ib/I0) and duration time (tD) to profile the blockage characteristics of single molecules. Although the WT and A21G A&#946;18&#8208;26 are indistinguishable in a traditional Ib/I0&#8208;tD 2D description, &#8764;87&#8201;% of the blockade events can be accurately classified with half reduction of false identification using a combination of Ib/I0, tD, and &#963;b. This work offers an easy and reliable strategy to promote nanopore sensitivity of peptide mutants, leading to a more precise analysis of pathogenic mutations for developing effective diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of N&#8722;N Bisindole Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N bisindole atropisomers based on the de novo construction of one indole skeleton is presented. A wide variety of N&#8722;N axially chiral bisindoles were obtained in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Structurally diverse indole&#8208;pyrrole, indole&#8208;carbazole and non&#8208;biaryl&#8208;indole atropisomers possessing a chiral N&#8722;N axis were accessed using this protocol.







Abstract
N&#8722;N Atropisomers are a common motif in natural products and represent a significant dimension for exploration in modern pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. However, the catalytic atroposelective synthesis of such molecules remains challenging, hampering meaningful development. In particular, an enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N bisindole atropisomers is unprecedented. Herein, the first enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N bisindole atropisomers via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed de novo construction of one indole skeleton is presented. A wide variety of N&#8722;N axially chiral bisindoles were generated in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities via a cascade condensation/N&#8208;arylation reaction. Structurally diverse indole&#8208;pyrrole, indole&#8208;carbazole, and non&#8208;biaryl&#8208;indole atropisomers possessing a chiral N&#8722;N axis were accessed using this protocol. Moreover, investigations using density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insight into the reaction mechanism and enantiocontrol.

         <title>Ti&#8208;doped CeO2 Stabilized Single&#8208;Atom Rhodium Catalyst for Selective and Stable CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We constructed single&#8208;atom Rh embedded on Ti&#8208;doped CeO2, which exhibited record&#8208;breaking TOF of 493.1&#8197;h&#8722;1, 99.1&#8201;% ethanol selectivity and outstanding stability in CO2 hydrogenation. Synergistic effects of Ti&#8208;doping and single&#8208;atom Rh favor CHx*/CO* formation and their subsequent coupling into ethanol. Ti&#8208;doping&#8208;induced crystal reconstruction leads to the stabilization of single&#8208;atom Rh site and catalytic stability.







Abstract
Development of effective and stable catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation into ethanol remains a challenge. Herein, we report that Rh1/CeTiOx single&#8208;atom catalyst constructed by embedding monoatomic Rh onto Ti&#8208;doped CeO2 support has shown a super high ethanol selectivity (&#8776;99.1&#8201;%), record&#8208;breaking turnover frequency (493.1&#8197;h&#8722;1), and outstanding stability. Synergistic effects of Ti&#8208;doption and monoatomic Rh contribute to this excellent catalytic performance by firstly facilitating oxygen vacancies formation to generate oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;Rh Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;base pairs, which favor CO2 adsorption and activation, cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds in CHxOH* and COOH* into CHx* and CO* species, subsequent C&#8722;C coupling and hydrogenation into ethanol, and secondly generating strong Rh&#8722;O bond by Ti&#8208;doping&#8208;induced crystal reconstruction, which contributes to striking stability. This work highlights the importance of support elaborating regulation for single&#8208;atom catalyst design to substantially improve the catalytic performance.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Mechanochemistry for the Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;Type Coupling of Aryl Sulfamates via Ball Milling and Twin&#8208;Screw Extrusion.

The nickel catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;type coupling of aryl sulfamates and boronic acid derivatives enabled by temperature&#8208;controlled mechanochemistry via the development of a programmable PID&#8208;controlled jar heater is reported. This base&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;free, all&#8208;under&#8208;air protocol was also scaled 200&#8208;fold using twin&#8208;screw extrusion technology affording decagram quantities of material.







Abstract
The use of temperature&#8208;controlled mechanochemistry to enable the mechanochemical nickel&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling is herein described. Transitioning from a capricious room&#8208;temperature protocol, through to a heated, PID&#8208;controlled programmable jar heater manifold was required to deliver an efficient method for the coupling of aryl sulfamates (derived from ubiquitous phenols) and aryl boronic acid species. Furthermore, this process is conducted using a base&#8208;metal nickel catalyst, in the absence of bulk solvent, and in the absence of air/moisture sensitive reaction set&#8208;ups. This methodology is showcased through translation to large&#8208;scale twin&#8208;screw extrusion methodology enabling 200&#8208;fold scale increase, producing decagram quantities of C&#8722;C coupled material.

         <title>Piezo&#8208;Photocatalytic Synergy in BiFeO3@COF Z&#8208;Scheme Heterostructures for High&#8208;Efficiency Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We combined covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and piezoelectric material by covalent bonds to form a high&#8208;efficient Z&#8208;scheme core@shell heterostructure piezo&#8208;photocatalyst with tunable shell thickness for overall water splitting. The optimal sample reveals the unprecedented H2 and O2 production rates of 1416.4 and 708.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 under the excitation of ultrasonication coupled with visible light irradiation. This work will provide a new sight for the practical application of highly efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven overall water splitting is an ideal way to generate renewable energy while still challenging. For the first time, this work combined covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and piezoelectric material by covalent linkages to form Z&#8208;scheme core@shell heterostructure for overall water splitting. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between the polarized electric field and photo&#8208;generated charges, as well as the precise adjustment of shell thickness, the carrier separation and utilization efficiency is greatly improved. The optimal BiFeO3@TpPa&#8208;1&#8208;COF photocatalyst revealed hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) production rates of 1416.4 and 708.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 under the excitation of ultrasonication coupled with light irradiation, which is the best performance among various piezo&#8208; and COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. This provides a new sight for the practical application of highly efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting.

         <title>Dynamic AIE crosslinks in liquid crystal networks: visualizing for actuation&#8208;guiding, re&#8208;bonding for actuation&#8208;altering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel covalent adaptable liquid crystal network (CALCN) actuators crosslinked by dynamic AIE luminogens were built based on Diels&#8211;Alder chemistry. This all&#8208;in&#8208;one material design &#8220;visualizes&#8221;, through fluorescing, the crosslinking state and actuation capability for actuation&#8208;guiding in CALCN, while enabling network &#8220;re&#8208;bonding&#8221; through associative and dissociative exchange mechanisms for unprecedented actuation&#8208;reprogrammability.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable liquid crystal networks (CALCNs) are highly potential actuating materials due to their actuation properties and shape reprogrammability. Given the importance of network crosslinking state in a CALCN actuator, we sought an all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy to probe and visualize its dynamic network while ensuring actuation and reprogramming. Here, tetraphenylethylene derivatives were incorporated into liquid crystal networks via the Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) reaction, acting simultaneously as reversible crosslinkers and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorescent probes. The thermally tunable fluorescence of the resulting network can correlate to and thus visualize the actuator's crosslinking status, actuation capability and temperature in real&#8208;time and in situ, yielding an intriguing actuation limit&#8208;alerting function. Furthermore, we verified unprecedented reprogrammability of the AIE&#8208;type CALCNs through both associative and dissociative exchange mechanisms of DA chemistry.

         <title>Intranuclear Nanoribbons for Selective Killing of Osteosarcoma Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon the dephosphorylation of ALP, the leucine&#8208;rich phosphopeptides self&#8208;assemble into micelles and then convert into nanoribbons. The phosphopeptides/assemblies first aggregate on the cell membrane of osteosarcoma cells, and then enter cells via endocytosis, disrupt the nuclear membrane, and finally accumulate in nuclei by interaction with histone proteins to induce cell death.







Abstract
Herein, we show intranuclear nanoribbons formed upon dephosphorylation of leucine&#8208;rich L&#8208; or D&#8208;phosphopeptide catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to selectively kill osteosarcoma cells. Being dephosphorylated by ALP, the peptides are first transformed into micelles and then converted into nanoribbons. The peptides/assemblies first aggregate on cell membranes, then enter cells via endocytosis, and finally accumulate in nuclei (mainly in nucleoli). Proteomics analysis suggests that the assemblies interact with histone proteins. The peptides kill osteosarcoma cells rapidly and are nontoxic to normal cells. Moreover, the repeated stimulation of the osteosarcoma cells by the peptides sensitizes the cancer cells rather than inducing resistance. This work not only illustrates a novel mechanism for nucleus targeting, but may also pave a new way for selectively killing osteosarcoma cells and minimizing drug resistance.

         <title>Activity&#8208;based Photoacoustic Probes Reveal Elevated Intestinal MGL and FAAH Activity in a Murine Model of Obesity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;based sensing probes and whole&#8208;body photoacoustic imaging have enabled the selective detection of monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) activity in the context of obesity and gastrointestinal tract inflammation.







Abstract
Obesity is a chronic health condition characterized by the accumulation of excessive body fat which can lead to and exacerbate cardiovascular disease, type&#8208;II diabetes, high blood pressure, and cancer through systemic inflammation. Unfortunately, visualizing key mediators of the inflammatory response, such as monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), in a selective manner is a profound challenge owing to an overlapping substrate scope that involves arachidonic acid (AA). Specifically, these enzymes work in concert to generate AA, which in the context of obesity, has been implicated to control appetite and energy metabolism. In this study, we developed the first selective activity&#8208;based sensing probes to detect MGL (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;MGL) and FAAH (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;FAAH) activity via photoacoustic imaging. Activation of PA&#8208;HD&#8208;MGL and PA&#8208;HD&#8208;FAAH by their target enzymes resulted in 1.74&#8208;fold and 1.59&#8208;fold signal enhancements, respectively. Due to their exceptional selectivity profiles and deep&#8208;tissue photoacoustic imaging capabilities, these probes were employed to measure MGL and FAAH activity in a murine model of obesity. Contrary to conflicting reports suggesting levels of MGL can be attenuated or elevated, our results support the latter. Indeed, we discovered a marked increase of both targets in the gastrointestinal tract. These key findings set the stage to uncover the role of the endocannabinoid pathway in obesity&#8208;mediated inflammation.

         <title>Optically Controlled Thermochromic Switching for Multi&#8208;Input Molecular Logic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We ideally design azobenzenes with alkyl chains (AZO(n)) as a photo trigger in the leuco dye based thermochromic system. The color developer in this system can be reversibly locked by Z&#8208;AZO(n), leading to the leuco dye cannot capture the proton from color developer to form the larger conjugate structure, while it can be released upon Z&#8208;to&#8208;E photoisomerization. This new strategy can be considered as a possible multi&#8208;input molecular logic system.







Abstract
Leuco dye&#8208;based thermochromic materials offer enormous potential for visible molecular logic due to the appealing reversible color&#8208;changing effect. The stable color state is uncontrollable as it depends only on the spontaneous protonation of the leuco dye and color developer. There is still a challenge to propose an effective approach to control bistable color function at required temperature. A family of azobenzenes with various alkyl chains (AZO(n)) is designed for protonation competition with leuco dye. The hydrogen bond and Van der Waals forces are formed between color developer and AZO(n). The color developer can be locked to provide the proton for the leuco dye by Z&#8208;AZO(n), while it can be released upon Z&#8208;to&#8208;E photoisomerization. The locked state can be lasted for more than 16&#8197;hours. This optically controlled leuco dye&#8208;based system demonstrates a visible sequential logic operation with four&#8208;input signals, and provides a new type of protonation&#8208;based optical control.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Regulated Conformational Change of Disulfide&#8208;Rich Assembling Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disulfide bond formation is usually used in nature for the regulation and stabilization of protein conformations. This principle has now been expanded to control the conformational change of thiol&#8208;rich peptides into an amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation, which undergoes a subsequent self&#8208;assembly to form a mechanically rigid hydrogel. Such a stimuli&#8208;responsive feature allows the biomedical application of such peptides.







Abstract
Disulfide bond formation is a common mechanism for regulating conformational changes in proteins during oxidative folding. Despite extensive studies of the use of multiple disulfide bonds to constrain peptide conformation, few studies have explored their usage in developing self&#8208;assembling peptides. Herein, we report that a thiol&#8208;rich peptide could fold into an amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation through the formation of two hetero&#8208;disulfide bonds upon oxidation, subsequently self&#8208;assembling into a mechanically rigid hydrogel. Breaking disulfide bonds under reductive condition, the hydrogel exhibited a transition from hydrogel to solution. Molecular simulation revealed that intermolecular interaction between two tryptophan residues was indispensable for hydrogelation. This work is the first case of the use of multiple disulfide bonds to control conformational change and self&#8208;assembly, and provides a cell&#8208;compatible hydrogel material for potential biomedical application.

         <title>Heteroatoms Induce Localization of the Electric Field and Promote a Wide Potential&#8208;Window Selectivity Towards CO in the CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin heteroatoms on a silver catalyst generate very strong and atomically localized electric fields, as disclosed by differential phase contrast&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (DPC&#8208;STEM). This results in a 100&#8201;% selectivity for CO at a wide range of potentials (&#8722;0.5&#8197;V to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. RHE).







Abstract
Carbon dioxide electroreduction (CO2RR) is a sustainable way of producing carbon&#8208;neutral fuels. Product selectivity in CO2RR is regulated by the adsorption energy of reaction&#8208;intermediates. Here, we employ differential phase contrast&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (DPC&#8208;STEM) to demonstrate that Sn heteroatoms on a Ag catalyst generate very strong and atomically localized electric fields. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IR) results verified that the localized electric field enhances the adsorption of *COOH, thus favoring the production of CO during CO2RR. The Ag/Sn catalyst exhibits an approximately 100&#8201;% CO selectivity at a very wide range of potentials (from &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V, versus reversible hydrogen electrode), and with a remarkably high energy efficiency (EE) of 76.1&#8201;%.

         <title>The Continuum Between Hexagonal Planar and Trigonal Planar Geometries
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation and bonding analysis of a series of heterometallic hydride complexes shows they have subtly different bonding geometries. These compounds can be described as snapshots along a continuum of bonding between trigonal and hexagonal planar geometries.







Abstract
New heterometallic hydride complexes that involve the addition of {Mg&#8722;H} and {Zn&#8722;H} bonds to group 10 transition metals (Pd, Pt) are reported. The side&#8208;on coordination of a single {Mg&#8722;H} to Pd forms a well&#8208;defined &#963;&#8208;complex. In contrast, addition of three {Mg&#8722;H} or {Zn&#8722;H} bonds to Pd or Pt results in the formation of planar complexes with subtly different geometries. We compare their structures through experiment (X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, multinuclear NMR), computational methods (DFT, QTAIM, NCIPlot), and theoretical analysis (MO diagram, Walsh diagram). These species can be described as snapshots along a continuum of bonding between ideal trigonal planar and hexagonal planar geometries.

         <title>Unique Double Intramolecular and Intermolecular Exciton Coupling in Ethene&#8208;Bridged aza&#8208;BODIPY Dimers for High&#8208;Efficiency Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Conversion and Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aza&#8208;BODIPY dimer exhibits unique double intra&#8208; and intermolecular exciton couplings, resulting in a dramatic red&#8208;shift of the absorption to the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region. Its self&#8208;assembled nanoparticles have high photothermal conversion ability and are ultra&#8208;photostable, which can efficiently lead to complete tumor ablation under 915&#8197;nm laser irradiation with ultralow power density.







Abstract
Spatial electronic communications of chromophores are both theoretically and practically fascinating. Despite intramolecular or intermolecular exciton coupling was observed in multichromophoric oligomers and J&#8208;aggregates, respectively, it is unusual that they both occur in the same molecule. Herein, ethene&#8208;bridged aza&#8208;BODIPY dimers with intramolecular exciton splitting have been developed. By encapsulating the dimer into F&#8208;127 polymer, J&#8208;type aggregated nanoparticles were produced, which showed obvious intermolecular exciton coupling and dramatically redshifted absorption and emission peaks at 936 and 1003&#8197;nm, respectively. The fabricated nanoagents have high photothermal conversion ability (&#951;=60.3&#8201;%) and are ultra&#8208;photostable, leading to complete tumor ablation with 915&#8197;nm laser irradiation. This phototherapeutic nanoplatform through modulating both intra&#8208; and intermolecular exciton couplings is a valuable paradigm for developing photothermal agents for tumor treatment.

         <title>Facile Route to Novel Diazaphosphinine&#8208;Based Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of diazaphosphinine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (DP&#8208;PAHs) is reported. The electronic structures and optoelectronic properties are highly tunable via the rich phosphorus chemistry. With balanced S1 and T1 emission, DP&#8208;PAH with P=S center exhibits a single&#8208;molecule white&#8208;light emitting character in the crystalline state.







Abstract
Doping main&#8208;group elements has become a unique strategy to fine&#8208;tune optoelectronic properties of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Herein, we report the first example of diazaphosphinine based polycyclic hydrocarbons (DP&#8208;PAHs) via facile synthetic protocols. Synthesis of diazaphosphinine heterocycles harnesses mild and efficient P&#8722;N chemistry. The heterocycles readily undergo photocyclizations by using only oxidants. The photocyclization protocol is applicable to the heterocycles with various P&#8208;centers. We successfully extended the protocols in extended DP&#8208;PAHs with 13&#8208;fused aromatic rings. Further adjusting P&#8208;chemistry allows to efficiently fine&#8208;tune the singlet and triplet emission characteristics. More importantly, single&#8208;molecule white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting character was achieved via the balanced singlet and triplet emission of DP&#8208;PAH. Therefore, this work opens up new horizons in the area of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials.

Boron&#8208;doped diamond catalyst is adopted for electrooxidation synthesis of formamide from methanol and ammonia with high activity and durability. A scale&#8208;up 8&#8197;L electrolyzer with an external renewable power supply for the production of formamide is designed to enable its scalable production (FE: 33.5&#8201;%, output: 36.9&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1), which shows the potential for the large&#8208;scale electrosynthesis of formamide.







Abstract
The scalable and durable electrosynthesis of high&#8208;valued organonitrogen compounds from carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing small molecules, especially operating at a high current density, is highly desirable. Here, a one&#8208;pot electrooxidation method to synthesize formamide (HCONH2) from methanol and ammonia over a commercial boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) catalyst is reported. The formamide selectivity from methanol and formamide Faradaic efficiency (FE
) achieve 73.2&#8201;% and 41.2&#8201;% at the current density of 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with high durability. The C&#8722;N bond originates from the nucleophilic attack of ammonia on an aldehyde&#8208;like intermediate. Impressively, an 8&#8197;L electrolyzer is employed for the pilot plant test over a 2200&#8197;cm2 BDD electrode, which exhibits 33.5&#8201;% FE
 at 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (current: 264&#8197;A) with a yield rate of 36.9&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1, demonstrating the potential of this technique for large&#8208;scale electrosynthesis of formamide.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Solid Superprotonic Supramolecular Polymer Electrolytes Based on Deep Eutectic Solvents and Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalate nanoclusters are used as supramolecular cross&#8208;linkers to solidify deep eutectic solvents, which creates semi&#8208;solid supramolecular polymer electrolytes with superprotonic conductivity. Upon mild heating, these electrolytes can infiltrate into the voids in supercapacitor electrodes, form highly stable interfaces, and lead to improved electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers (SPs) exhibit intriguing benefits in functional soft materials due to their dynamic bonding feature. However, most SPs can only exist in the solution state and fail to form bulk materials, which limits their applications. Here, we report the fabrication of semi&#8208;solid bulk SP materials by using polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters as supramolecular cross&#8208;linkers to solidify a deep eutectic solvent (DES). The abundant protons and strong hydrogen bonds afforded by POMs enable these SP materials as superprotonic conductive electrolytes with sufficient mechanical strength, showing a proton conductivity more than 1&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a breaking strength exceeding 1&#8197;MPa at room temperature. Moreover, the thermodynamic reversibility of the SP electrolytes allows them to form a stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface by a facile melt&#8208;infiltration strategy upon mild heating, which leads to improved performance in supercapacitors. This work presents an innovative DES/POM hybrid system as a promising platform to develop functional supramolecular materials for energy and electronic applications.

         <title>Origins of p&#8208;Doping and Nonradiative Recombination in CsSnI3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn vacancies have long been thought to be the key defects inducing high p&#8208;type self&#8208;doping in Sn&#8208;based perovskites, such as CsSnI3. However, by performing rigorous first&#8208;principles calculations, it is revealed that the defects dominating p&#8208;doping are Cs vacancies instead of Sn vacancies.







Abstract
It is commonly believed that the spontaneous p&#8208;doping in Sn&#8208;based perovskites is caused by Sn vacancies. By performing rigorous first&#8208;principles calculations for a prototypical Sn&#8208;based perovskite CsSnI3, we reveal that, in fact, the defects dominating p&#8208;doping are Cs vacancies. The reason that adding extra Sn2+ could reduce p&#8208;doping is that Cs and Sn present the same changing trend in terms of chemical potentials, and thus inhibiting the formation of Sn vacancies will also limit the formation of Cs vacancies. Moreover, we show that I vacancies are the dominant nonradiative recombination centers, and can result in sizable nonradiative losses, which explains why the experimentally measured carrier lifetime is only a few nanoseconds even if p&#8208;doping is suppressed. This work provides new insights into the origins of p&#8208;doping and nonradiative recombination in CsSnI3, and suggests that minimizing the formation of Cs and I vacancies is critical to realizing the best device performance.

Efforts to deepen the understanding of sustainable development have resulted in the concept of green carbon science. In this Review, technological achievements in green carbon science are discussed, with a focus on pilot testing, industrial demonstrations, and commercial applications beyond the laboratory stage.







Abstract
The concept of green carbon science is to promote the goal of achieving carbon neutrality, the importance and urgency of which have been well&#8208;recognized and received worldwide attention. Carbon neutrality has become the focus of research work in many fields, and correspondingly, a growing number of papers and publications have been published over the last few years. However, since carbon neutralization is a real problem that urgently requires technical solutions, the transition from fundamental research to practical applications must be accelerated. A number of research teams are bold in putting things into practice and blazing new trails. This Review summarizes the recent technological developments within the framework of green carbon science, focusing on conducted pilot tests, industrial demonstrations, and commercial applications beyond the laboratory stage.

&lt;p&gt;The concept of green carbon science is to promote the goal of achieving carbon neutrality, the importance and urgency of which have been well-recognized and received worldwide attention. Carbon neutrality has become the focus of research work in many fields, and correspondingly, a growing number of papers and publications have been published over the last few years. However, since carbon neutralization is a real problem that urgently requires technical solutions, the transition from fundamental research to practical applications must be accelerated. A number of research teams are bold in putting things into practice and blazing new trails. This Review summarizes the recent technological developments within the framework of green carbon science, focusing on conducted pilot tests, industrial demonstrations, and commercial applications beyond the laboratory stage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Vivo Olefin Metathesis in Microalgae Upgrades Lipids to Building Blocks for Polymers and Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic olefin metathesis can be performed in live microalgae, converting the fatty acids stored in lipid organelles to polymer building blocks and chemicals in vivo.







Abstract
Sustainable sources are key to future chemicals production. Microalgae are promising resources as they fixate carbon dioxide to organic molecules by photosynthesis. Thereby they produce unsaturated fatty acids as established raw materials for the industrial production of chemical building blocks. Although these renewable feedstocks are generated inside cells, their catalytic upgrading to useful products requires in vitro transformations. A synthetic catalysis inside photoautotrophic cells has remained elusive. Here we show that a catalytic conversion of renewable substrates can be realized directly inside living microalgae. Organometallic catalysts remain active inside the cells, enabling in vivo catalytic olefin metathesis as new&#8208;to&#8208;nature transformation. Stored lipids are converted to long&#8208;chain dicarboxylates as valuable building blocks for polymers. This is a key step towards the long&#8208;term goal of producing desired renewable chemicals in microalgae as living &#8220;cellular factories&#8221;.

         <title>Generation of Tunable Ultrastrong White&#8208;Light Emission by Activation of a Solid Supramolecule through Bromonaphthylpyridinium Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid supramolecule based on a sulfobutylether&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and diarylethene derivative has been developed by a bromonaphthylpyridinium polymerization strategy. The supramolecule exhibits tunable phosphorescence emission in the amorphous state and can be applied for stimuli&#8208;responsive data encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Herein, we reported solid supramolecular bromonaphthylpyridinium polymers (P&#8208;BrNp), which exhibit tunable phosphorescence emission in the amorphous state enabled by sulfobutylether&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (SBE&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD) and diarylethene derivatives. The monomer BrNp gave single fluorescence emission at 490&#8197;nm, while an apparent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) at 550&#8197;nm emerged for P&#8208;BrNp copolymers with various feed ratios. Through fluorescence&#8208;phosphorescence dual emission, P&#8208;BrNp&#8208;0.1 displayed an ultrahigh white&#8208;light emission quantum yield of 83.9&#8201;%. Moreover, the subsequent assembly with SBE&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD further enhanced the phosphorescent quantum yield of P&#8208;BrNp&#8208;0.1 from 64.1&#8201;% to 71.3&#8201;%, accompanied by the conversion of photoluminescence emission from white to yellow. Diarylethene monomers were introduced as photoswitches to realize reversible RTP emission, which can be used in switchable data encryption and multifunctional writing ink.

         <title>Nanoelectrochemistry Reveals Selective Interactions of Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs) with Silver Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoelectrochemistry using single&#8208;particle collisions&#160;on microelectrode&#160;supported by spectroscopic and theoretical studies provide insights into the molecular interactions of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at single&#8208;particle scale. This new approach provides the foundational knowledge to advance the design of materials and methods for the ultrasensitive detection of these chemicals, as reported by Silvana Andreescu et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202209164).

         <title>Cross &#946; Amyloid Nanotubes Demonstrate Promiscuous Catalysis in a Chemical Reaction Network via Co&#8208;option</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In Darwin&#8217;s warm pond rich with nutrients, lesser number of early catalytic machineries with modest capabilities were able to demonstrate promiscuity by catalyzing diverse biochemical transformations important for protometabolism. Herein, we report catalytically promiscuous amyloid&#8208;based short peptide assemblies that could concomitantly catalyse three metabolically important yet orthogonal reactions. The surface exposed catalytic dyads featuring lysines and imidazoles were utilized for C=N condensation via dynamic covalent linkages and modulation of protonation events, respectively. Further, the peptide assemblies could promiscuously catalyse hydrolysis as well as retro&#8208;aldol reactions, that could be co&#8208;opted to facilitate C=N bond formation, either by a feedforward&#8208;driven reaction network or by replenishing depleted substrates. The catalytic diversity of short peptide based promiscuous &#946;&#8208;sheet folds suggests their possible role in promoting the protometabolic network in early earth.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Design of Structural and Functional Polymers for a Circular Economy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To achieve a sustainable circular economy, polymers need to start transitioning to recycled and biobased feedstock and accomplish CO2  emission neutrality. This is not only true for structural polymers, such as in packaging or engineering applications, but also for functional polymers in liquid formulations, such as adhesives, lubricants, thickeners or dispersants. At their end of life, polymers need to be either collected and recycled via a technical pathway, or be biodegradable if they are not collectable. Advances in polymer chemistry and applications, aided by computational material science, open the way to addressing these issues comprehensively by designing for recyclability and biodegradability. This review explores how scientific advances, together with emerging regulatory frameworks, societal expectations and economic boundary conditions, paint pathways for the transformation towards a circular economy of polymers.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide perovskite has been widely studied as a new generation of photoelectronic materials. However, their thermal and humidity&#8208;induced emission quenching have greatly limited their utility and reliability. Here, we report a hexagonal Mn2+&#8208;doped CsCdCl3 perovskite crystal that possesses stable photoluminescence (PL) at both high temperature and humidity. The room temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) of the single crystals lasts up to 1480 s and can be adjusted by changing the concentration of Mn2+ ion doping. The characteristic emission of d&#8208;d transition of Mn2+ is realized, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is up to 91.4%, it can maintain more than 90% of the initial PL spectral integral area at 150 &#176;C (423 K). High humid stability PL can be achieved more than 75% of the initial PL intensity after 55 days of immersion in water. These excellent properties show the application prospect of the LPL material in lighting indication and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Elucidation, Total Synthesis, Antibacterial In Vivo Efficacy and Biosynthesis Proposal of Myxobacterial Corramycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the myxobacterial natural product Corramycin isolated from Corallococcus coralloides. The linear peptide structure contains an unprecedented (2R,3S)&#8209;&#947;&#8209;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8209;histidine moiety. Corramycin exhibits anti&#8208;Gram&#8208;negative activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and is taken up via two transporter systems, SbmA and YejABEF. Furthermore, the Corramycin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was identified and a biosynthesis model was proposed involving a 12&#8208;modular non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthase. Bioinformatic analysis of the BGC combined with the development of a total synthesis route allowed for the elucidation of the molecule&#8217;s absolute configuration. Importantly, intravenous administration of 30&#160;mg kg&#8209;1 of Corramycin in an E. coli mouse infection model resulted in 60 % survival of animals without toxic side effects. Corramycin is thus a promising starting point to develop a potent antibacterial drug against hospital&#8209;acquired infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted Metal&#8208;Air Batteries: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;air batteries are considered one of the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices owing to their ultrahigh theoretical specific energy. However, sluggish cathode kinetics (O2 and CO2 reduction/evolution) result in large overpotentials and low round&#8208;trip efficiencies which seriously hinder their practical applications. Utilizing light to drive slow cathode processes has increasingly becoming a promising solution to this issue. Considering the rapid development and emerging issues of this field, this review aims to timely summarize the current understanding of light&#8208;assisted metal&#8208;air batteries in terms of configurations and mechanisms, provides the general design strategies and specific examples of photocathodes, systematically discuss the influences of light on the battery, and finally provide existing gaps and future priorities towards practical light&#8208;assisted metal&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthetic Elucidation and Structural Revision of Brevione E: Characterization of the Key Dioxygenase for Pathway Branching from Setosusin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Brevione E (1) is a fungal hexacyclic meroditerpenoid with unique oxepane and cycloheptenone moieties. In this study, we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster of&#160;1&#160;and elucidated its biosynthetic pathway via heterologous expression of the biosynthetic genes and in vitro enzymatic reactions. Surprisingly, reexamination of the structure of&#160;1&#160;revealed a substituted tetrahydrofuran ring instead of the previously proposed oxepane system. Moreover, we determined that cycloheptenone synthesis involves skeletal rearrangement catalyzed by the &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase BrvJ. BrvJ is highly homologous to SetK, which engages in the biosynthesis of another fungal metabolite, setosusin, and accepts the same substrate as BrvJ but performs only simple hydroxylation. Finally, we identified the key amino acid residues critical for product selectivity of BrvJ and SetK, providing insight into how the biosynthesis pathways of&#160;1&#160;and setosusin diverge and how fungi diversify natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Intermolecular Interaction and Interphase Chemistry Enabled Sustainable Water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid electrolyte interphase(SEI) formation and H2O activity reduction in Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt electrolytes (WiSE) with an enlarged stability window of 3 V have provided the feasibility of the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries. Here, we extend the cathodic potential of WiSE by rationally controlling intermolecular interaction and interphase chemistry with the introduction of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) into WiSE. The TMP not merely limits the H2O activity via the strong interaction between TMP and H2O but also contributes to the formation of reinforced SEI involving phosphate and LiF by manipulating the Li+ solvation structure. Thus, water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4 (LMO)||Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) full cell with a P/N ratio of 1.14 can be assembled and achieve a long cycling life of 1000 times with high coulombic efficiency of &gt;99.9%. This work provides a promising insight into the cost&#8208;effective practical manufacture of LMO||LTO cells without rigorous moisture&#8208;free requirements.</dc:description>

         <title>pH Dependence of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Fibril Assembly Kinetics: Unravelling the Microscopic Molecular Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Central to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is the assembly of the amyloid&#8208;beta peptide (A&#946;) into fibrils. A reduction in pH accompanying inflammation or subcellular compartments, may accelerate fibril formation as the pH approaches A&#946;&#8217;s isoelectric point (pI). Using global fitting of thioflavin&#8208;T to monitor fibril formation kinetics over a range of pHs, we identify the impact net charge has on individual microscopic rate constants which are associated with fibril assembly. We show that the primary nucleation has a strong pH dependence. The titration behaviour exhibits a mid&#8208;point or pKa of 7.0, close to the pKa of A&#946; histidine imidazoles. Surprisingly, both the secondary nucleation and elongation rate constants are pH independent. This indicates the charge of A&#946;, in particular histidine protonation, has little impact on this stage of A&#946; assembly. These fundamental processes are key to understanding the forces that drive the assembly of A&#946; into toxic oligomers and fibrils.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heteroleptic six&#8208;component double slider&#8208;on&#8208;deck system  DS3  exhibits tight coupling of motional speed of two distinct nano&#8208;circular sliders (k298  = 77 and 41 kHz) despite a 2.2 nm sepa&#173;ration. In comparison, the single sliders in  DS1  and  DS2  move at vastly diffe&#173;rent speed (k298  = 1.1 vs. 350 kHz). Synchro&#173;nization of the motions in  DS3  remains even when one slows the movement of the faster slider using small molecular brake pads. In contrast to the individual  DS1  and  DS2  systems,  DS3  is a powerful catalyst for a two&#8208;step reaction by using the motion of both sliders to drive two catalytic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Expansion of the Catalytic Repertoire of Alcohol Dehydrogenases in Plant Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Medium&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) comprise a highly conserved enzyme family that catalyse the reversible reduction of aldehydes. However, recent discoveries in plant natural product biosynthesis suggest that the catalytic repertoire of ADHs has been expanded. Here we report the crystal structure of dihydroprecondylocarpine acetate synthase (DPAS), an ADH that catalyses the non&#8208;canonical 1,4&#8208;reduction of an &#945;,&#946; &#8208;unsaturated iminium moiety. Comparison with structures of plant&#8208;derived ADHs suggest the 1,4&#8208;iminium reduction does not require a proton relay or the presence of a catalytic zinc ion in contrast to canonical 1,2&#8208;aldehyde reducing ADHs that require the catalytic zinc and a proton relay. Furthermore, ADHs that catalysed 1,2&#8208;iminium reduction required the presence of the catalytic zinc and the loss of the proton relay. This suggests how the ADH active site can be modified to perform atypical carbonyl reductions, providing insight into how chemical reactions are diversified in plant metabolism.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of a Library of Heparan Sulfate&#8208;Like &#8220;Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail&#8221; Linked Multimers for Structure and Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heparan sulfate (HS) plays important roles in many biological processes. The inherent complexity of naturally existing HS has severely hindered the thorough understanding of their structure&#8208;activity relationship. To facilitate biological studies, a new strategy has been developed to synthesize a HS&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharide library, where HS disaccharides were linked in a &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; fashion from the reducing end of a disaccharide module to the non&#8208;reducing end of a neighboring module. Combinatorial syntheses of 27 HS&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharides were achieved. This new class of compounds bound with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF&#8208;2) with similar structure&#8208;activity trends as HS oligosaccharides bearing native glycosyl linkages. The ease of synthesis and the ability to mirror natural HS activity trends suggest that the new head&#8208;to&#8208;tail linked pseudo&#8208;oligosaccharides could be an exciting tool to facilitate the understanding of HS biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Nodulisporic Acids: A Multifunctional Monooxygenase Delivers a Complex and Highly Branched Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nodulisporic acids (NAs) are structurally complex potent antiinsectan indole diterpenes. We previously reported the biosynthetic gene cluster for these metabolites in Hypoxylon pulicicidum and functionally characterised the first five steps of the biosynthetic pathway. Here we reveal a highly complex biosynthetic array, furnishing multiple end products through expression of cluster components in Penicillium paxilli. We show that seven additional cluster&#8208;encoded gene products comprise the biosynthetic machinery that elaborate precursor NAF in this highly branched pathway. The combined action of these enzymes delivers 37 NA congeners including four major end products, NAA, NAA1, NAA2 and NAA4. The plethora of intermediates arises due to modification of the carboxylated prenyl tail by a single promiscuous P450 monooxygenase, NodJ, a pivotal branchpoint enzyme which produces four distinct biosynthetic products giving rise to the complex metabolic grid that characterises NA biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stable salt of the metalloradical [Ni(C6H6)2]+  hitherto unknown in the condensed phase was synthesized from [Ni(CO)4]+[WCA]&#8211;  and benzene ([WCA]&#8211;  = [F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8211;; RF  = C(CF3)3). Single crystal XRD reveals a remarkable asymmetrically  &#951;3,  &#951;6&#8208;slipped sandwich structure. The magnetic properties of the [Ni(C6H6)2]+  cation were determined in solution and in the gas phase. Oxidation with the synergistic Ag+/0.5&#160;l2  system led to the salt [Ni(C6H6)2]2+  ([WCA]&#8211;)2  and all products were fully characterized by means of IR, Raman, NMR/EPR, single crystal and powder XRD.</dc:description>

         <title>Genome Mining Enabled by Biosynthetic Characterization Uncovers a Class of Benzoxazolinate&#8208;Containing Natural Products in Diverse Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzoxazolinate is a rare bis&#8208;heterocyclic moiety that interacts with proteins and DNA and confers extraordinary bioactivities on natural products, such as C&#8208;1027. However, the biosynthetic gene responsible for the key cyclization step of benzoxazolinate remains unclear. Here, we show a putative acyl AMP&#8208;ligase responsible for the last cyclization step. We then use the enzyme as a probe for genome mining and discover that the orphan benzobactin gene cluster in entomopathogenic bacteria prevails across Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. It turns out that&#160;Pseudomonas&#160;chlororaphis&#160;produces various benzobactins, whose&#160;biosyntheses arehighlighted by a synergistic effect of two unclustered genes encoding enzymes on boosting benzobactin production;&#160;the formation of non&#8208;proteinogenic 2&#8208;hydroxymethylserine by a serine hydroxymethyltransferase; and&#160;the types I and II NRPS architecture for structural diversity. Our findings reveal the biosynthetic potential of a widespread benzobactin gene cluster.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biaryls via Enantioselective Ullmann Coupling of ortho&#8208;Chlorinated Aryl Aldehydes Enabled by a Chiral 2,2&#697;&#8208;Bipyridine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first nickel&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective reductive Ullmann coupling of ortho&#8208;chlorinated aryl aldehyde was achieved under mild reaction conditions with a chiral 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine ligand (+)&#8208;DTB&#8208;SBpy, thus providing axially chiral biphenyl or binaphthyl dials with up to 99% yield and 99.5:0.5 er. The versatility of the products as common synthetic intermediates for diverse axially chiral ligands, catalysts, and functional molecules was demonstrated by short&#8208;step transformations. This protocol also allowed the concise and highly enantioselective formal total synthesis of biologically active natural products (+)&#8208;kotanin, (&#8208;)&#8208;isoschizandrin and (+)&#8208;gossypol.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for High&#8208;Performance Lithium/Sodium&#8208;Iodine Organic Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>The rechargeable lithium/sodium&#8208;iodine battery (Li/Na&#8208;I2) is&#160;a promising candidate for meeting the growing energy demand.&#160;Herein, a flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) linked to the Ti3C2Tx&#160;MXene complex (HOF@Ti3C2Tx) has been presented for iodine loading.&#160;HOF is self&#8208;assembled by&#160;organic monomers&#160;through hydrogen bonding interactions&#160;between each monomer. It leads to numerous cavities&#160;in HOF&#160;structure, which can encapsulate iodine&#160;through various adsorptive sites and intermolecular interactions. The unique structure of complex can&#160;accelerate the nucleation of iodine, achieve fast reaction kinetics, stabilize iodide and retard the shuttle effect, thus improving the cycling stability of I2&#8208;based batteries.&#160;The I2/HOF@Ti3C2Tx&#160;exhibits large reversible capacities of 260.2 and 207.6&#160;mAh g&#8208;1&#160;at 0.2 C after repeated cycling for Li&#8208;I2&#160;and Na&#8208;I2&#160;batteries, respectively.&#160;This work can&#160;gain insights into the HOF&#8208;related energy storage application with reversible iodine&#160;encapsulation and its related redox reaction mechanisms with Li and Na metal ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hewettite ZnV6O16&#183;8H2O with Remarkably Stable Layers and Ultralarge Interlayer Spacing for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage because of their intrinsic safety, low&#8208;cost and high energy&#8208;intensity. Vanadium&#8208;based materials are widely used as the cathode of ZIBs, especially A2V6O16&#183;nH2O (AVO, A=NH4+, Na, K). However, AVO suffers from serious dissolution, phase transformation and narrow gallery spacing (~3 &#197;), leading to poor cycling stability and rate capability. Herein, we unveil the root cause of the performance degradation in the AVO cathode and therefore developed a new high&#8208;performance cathode of ZnV6O16&#183;8H2O (ZVO) for ZIB. Through a method of ion exchange induced phase transformation, AVO was converted to hewettite ZVO with larger gallery spacing (~6 &#197;) and more stable V6O16 layers. ZVO cathode thus constructed delivers a high capacity of 365 and 170 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.3 and 15 A g&#8208;1, while 86% and 70% of its capacity are retained at 0.3 A g&#8208;1 after 300 cycles and at 15 A g&#8208;1 after 10000 cycles, substantially better than conventional AVO.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Editing of Stacked Aromatic Assemblies for Heteroannular C&#8722;H Functionalization by a Palladium Switch between Aromatic Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An approach allowing remote editing of stacked aromatic assemblies for heteroannular C&#8722;H functionalization would represent a transformative chemical toolbox that may make the diversi&#64257;cation of complex molecules in a straightforward manner. However, such a C&#8722;H activation is usually less kinetically and thermodynamically favorable than homoannular  ortho  C&#8722;H activation and remains a fundamental challenge. Herein we disclose an engineer's approach, using a transient ligand as an interim bridge between two aryl rings (analogues to mountaintops) to anchor the metal center on the remote heteroannular C&#8722;H bond. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we present the palladium&#8208;catalyzed heteroannular C&#8722;H olefination of stacked aromatic assemblies with olefins and allylation with vinyl acetates using L&#8208;  tert  &#8208;leucine acid as a transient ligand. Mechanistic investigations suggest an unusual olefin coordination&#8208;promoted interannular palladium migration process determinative for reversal of the site&#8208;selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Conformational Switching of a Zinc Finger Analogue Regulates the Mechanosensing and Differentiation of Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic conformational changes in the secondary structures of proteins are essential to their functions and can regulate diverse cellular events. Herein we design a synthetic polymer&#8208;based secondary structure analogue of Zinc finger (ZnF) by introducing a zinc coordination motif to overcome the free energy barrier predicted by theoretical calculations and fold free polymer chains. The conformational switching between unfolded and folded state of the ZnF analogue can be in situ triggered to drastically manipulate the accessibility of conjugated cell adhesive ligands to the cell membrane receptors, thereby effectively controlling the adhesion, spreading, mechanosensing, and differentiation of stem cells. We believe that emulating the dynamic secondary structures of proteins via rational design of folded synthetic polymer&#8211;cation complex is a promising strategy for developing bioactive materials to mediate desired cellular functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Carboxylation of Aryl Thianthrenium Salts with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboxyl group is one of the most widely used groups in organic synthesis. Herein, an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation of aryl thianthrenium salts with carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) at room temperature has been developed. The reaction employs low loading of cuprous chloride catalyst under 1 atm CO  2  and exhibits good functional group tolerance. In combination with C&#8722;H thianthrenation of aromatic hydrocarbons, this work provides an efficient method for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of aromatic hydrocarbons. It may serve as a significant late&#8208;stage carboxylation tool for the modification of drug molecules in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Removal and Degradation of Microplastics Using the Magnetic and Nanozyme Activities of Bare Iron Oxide Nanoaggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Removal and degradation of microplastics are often carried out separately. In this work, hydrophilic bare Fe3O4 nanoaggregates allowed efficient removal of the most common microplastics including high&#8208;density polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate. Full extraction was achieved using Fe3O4 at 1% of the mass of microplastics. Hydrogen bonding is the main force for the adsorption of Fe3O4. Unlike the more commonly used hydrophobically modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the bare Fe3O4 benefitted from the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of its exposed surface, enabling further catalytic degradation of microplastics with nearly 100% efficiency and easy recovery of the Fe3O4.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;&#8208;Gold Alloy Catalyzes the Aerobic Oxidation of Formic Acid for Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On&#8208;site hydrogen peroxide production through electrocatalytic and photocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions has recently attracted broad research interest. However, practical applications have thus far been plagued by the low activity and the requirement of complex equipment. Here, inspired by the process of biological hydrogen peroxide synthesis catalyzed by enzymes, we report a Pt&#8208;Au alloy to mimic the catalytic function of natural formate oxidase for hydrogen peroxide synthesis through aerobic oxidation of formic acid. The mass activity of the Pt&#8208;Au alloy is three times higher than that of formate oxidase. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the efficient dehydrogenation of formic acid and the high selectivity of the subsequent reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide account for the high hydrogen peroxide productivity. In addition, the formic acid aqueous solution provides an acidic environment, which is conducive to the utilization of the in situ generated hydrogen peroxide for oxidation reactions, including C&#8208;H bond oxidation and sterilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing All&#8208;climate Li&#8210;S Batteries via Sub&#8208;nano Aromatic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8210;S) batteries with high energy density are currently receiving enormous attention. However, their redox kinetics at low temperature is extremely tardy, and polysulfides shuttling is serious at high temperature, which severely hinders the implementation of wide&#8208;temperature Li&#8210;S batteries. Herein, we propose an all&#8208;climate Li&#8210;S battery based on an ether&#8208;based electrolyte by using a porous sub&#8208;nano aromatic framework (SAF) modified separator. It&#8217;s demonstrated that the fully conjugated SAF&#8208;3 with a small pore size (0.97 nm) and narrow bandgap (1.72 eV) could efficiently block the polysulfides shuttling at elevated temperature and boost the polysulfides conversion at low temperature. Consequently, the SAF&#8208;3 modified&#160;cells work well in a wide temperature ranging from &#8210;40 to 60 &#176;C.&#160;Furthermore, when operated at room temperature, the modified cell exhibits 90% capacity retention over 100 cycles under high&#8208;sulfur loading (5.0 mg cm&#8208;2) and lean electrolyte (5 mL mg&#8208;1).</dc:description>

         <title>Local Proton Source Enhanced Nitrogen Reduction on a Combined Cobalt&#8208;Molybdenum Catalyst for Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions has attracted considerable scientific and engineering interest as a green alternative route for NH3 production. Molybdenum is a promising candidate as an electrocatalyst for NRR as it has a suitable binding strength with N species. However, the design of an efficient Mo&#8208;based catalyst remains elusive. To enhance the selectivity of NRR toward NH3, we have developed a carbon nanofiber catalyst embedded with molybdenum and cobalt (Co&#8208;Mo&#8208;CNF). Co with a strong ability to dissociate water enhances local proton source near Mo, where the hydrogenation step of the NRR occurs. A NH3 formation rate of 72.72 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 34.5% were obtained at &#8722;0.5 V vs. RHE. We also attempted to provide a mechanistic understanding of the NRR via in situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and isotopic labeling experiments using 15N2 and D2O.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Transition metal complexes with photoactive chargetransfer excited states are pervasive throughout literature.

Meanwhile, interest in luminescence and reactivity of so&#8208;called spin&#8208;flip metal&#8208;centered states has risen dramatically after the  Molecular Ruby  [Cr(ddpd)  2  ]  3+  (ddpd =  N  ,  N  &#8217;dimethyl&#8208;  N  ,  N  &#8217;&#8208;dipyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine) unveiled design principles to access strong, long&#8208;lived emission from photostable chromium(III) complexes. This review contrasts the properties of emissive charge&#8208;transfer and spin&#8208;flip states illustrated with the prototypical complexes [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  and [Cr(ddpd)  2  ]  3+  . First, we discuss the nature of the relevant excited states, their tunability with regards to energy and lifetime, and their responses to external stimuli. The final section identifies strengths and weaknesses of the charge transfer and spin&#8208;flip states in applications such as photoredox catalysis, sensing and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).</dc:description>

         <title>The Elusive Mononitrosylated [Fe4S4] Cluster in Three Redox States</title>

         <dc:description>Iron&#8211;sulfur clusters are well&#8208;established targets in biological nitric oxide (NO) chemistry, but the key intermediate in these processes&#8212;a mononitrosylated [Fe4S4] cluster&#8212;has not been fully characterized in a protein or a synthetic model thereof. Here, we report the synthesis of a three&#8208;member redox series of isostructural mononitrosylated [Fe4S4] clusters.&#160;Mononitrosylation was achieved by binding NO to a 3:1 site&#8208;differentiated [Fe4S4]+&#160;cluster; subsequent oxidation and reduction afforded the other members of the series. All three clusters feature a local high&#8208;spin Fe3+&#160;center antiferromagnetically coupled to&#160;3[NO]&#8211;.&#160;The observation of an anionic NO ligand suggests that NO binding is accompanied by formal electron transfer from the cluster to NO. Preliminary reactivity studies with the monocationic cluster demonstrate that exposure to excess NO degrades the cluster, supporting the intermediacy of mononitrosylated intermediates in NO sensing/signaling.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bottom&#8208;up assembly of optically nonlinear and magnetically anisotropic lanthanide materials involving precisely placed spin carriers and optimized metal&#8208;ligand coordination offers a potential route to developing electronic architectures for coherent radiation generation and spin&#8208;based technologies, but the chemical design historically has been extremely hard to achieve. To address this, we developed a worthwhile avenue for creating new noncentrosymmetric chiral Ln3+ materials Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 (Ln = Sm, Dy, Yb) by mixed&#8208;ligand design. The materials exhibit phase&#8208;matching nonlinear optical responses, elucidating the feasibility of the heteroanionic strategy. Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 displays paramagnetic property with strong magnetic anisotropy facilitated by large spin&#8208;orbit coupling. This study demonstrates a new chemical pathway for creating previously unknown polar chiral magnets with multiple functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct TEM Observation of Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Heteroatom Incorporation into a Zeolite Framework: Towards Microscopic Design of Zeolite Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating hetero&#8208;metal&#8208;atom, e.g., titanium, into zeolite frameworks can enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity in oxidation reactions. However, the rational design of zeolites containing titanium at specific sites is difficult because the precise atomic structure during synthesis process remained unclear. Here, a titanosilicate with predictable titanium distribution was synthesized by mediating vacancies in a defective MSE&#8208;type zeolite precursor, based on a pre&#8208;designed synthetic route including modification of vacancies followed by titanium insertion, where electron microscopy (EM) plays a key role at each step resolving the atomic structure. Point defects including vacancies in the precursor and titanium incorporated into the vacancy&#8208;related positions have been directly observed. The results provide insights into the role of point defects in zeolites towards the rational synthesis of zeolites with desired microscopic arrangement of catalytically active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Exposed Facets of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;rate Alkaline Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have drawn growing attention as promising electrode candidates for rechargeable batteries. However, most studies focus on the direct use of MOF electrodes without any modification. Post&#8208;synthetic modification, a judicious tool to modify targeted properties of MOFs, has been long&#8208;neglected in the field of batteries. Herein, crystal&#8208;facet engineering is proposed to design MOF&#8208;based electrodes with high capacity and fast electrochemical kinetics. We found that a thermally&#8208;modified strategy can regulate the dominant exposed facet of Ni&#8208;based MOF (PFC&#8208;8). With the optimally exposed facets, the battery exhibited admirable rate capability (139.4 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 2.5 A g  &#8208;1  and 110.0 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 30 A g  &#8208;1  ) and long&#8208;term stability. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations demonstrate that stronger OH  &#8208;  adsorption behaviors and optimized electronic structures induced by the regulated exposed facets boost the electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

Herein, we describe the rapid synthesis of tetracyclic metallaaromatics containing quinoline and pentalene motifs fused by a metal&#8208;bridged fragment. These unique compounds display remarkably broad absorption, enabling for the first time the absorption of metallaaromatics to reach the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) biowindow. The formation of osmaquinoline unit involves an unconventional C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) coupling promoted by AgBF4 to achieve [3+3] cycloaddition.

The considerable photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) in both the NIR&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II windows, the high photothermal stability and the excellent electrochemical behavior suggest many potential applications of these condensed metallaquinolines.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="Abstract" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font&#8208;size: medium;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN&#8208;US"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The ability to precisely control the subcellular distribution of luminous materials presents unprecedented advantages for understanding cell biology and disease therapy. We introduce a luminescence tool for subcellular distribution imaging and differentiation of live and dead cells, utilizing cationic organoplatinum(II) complexes that exhibit well&#8208;defined monomeric to aggregate nanostructures along with concentration&#8208;dependent switchable luminescence from green to red due to assembly via Pt(II)&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt(II) and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. One of the complexes was chosen to demonstrate the unique lysosome&#8208;to&#8208;nucleus subcellular re&#8208;distribution and imaging capability in live and dead cells, respectively, which represents the first example to discriminate the subcellular localization of platinum(II) complexes through differential luminescence response.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High energy demand results in comprehensive research of novel materials for energy sources and storage applications. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess appropriate features such as long&#8208;range order, permanent porosity, tunable pore size, and ion diffusion pathways to be competitive electrode materials. Herein, we present a deep electrochemical study of two COF&#8208;aerogels shaped into flexible COF&#8208;electrodes (ECOFs) by a simple compression method to fabricate an electrochemical double&#8208;layer capacitor (EDLC). This energy storage system has considerable interest owing to its high&#8208;power density and long cycle life compared with batteries. Our result confirmed the outstanding behavior of ECOFs as EDLC devices with a capacity retention of almost 100% after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles and, to our knowledge, the highest areal capacitance (9.55 mF cm&#8208;2) in aqueous electrolytes at higher scan rates (1000 mV s&#8208;1) for COFs. More importantly, the hierarchical porosity observed in the ECOFs increases ion transport, which permits a fast interface polarization (low &#964;0 values). The complete sheds light on using ECOFs as novel electrode material to fabricate EDLC devices.</dc:description>

The complete sheds light on using ECOFs as novel electrode material to fabricate EDLC devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ru&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Nanoradiosensitizers Enhance Radiotherapy by Combining ROS Generation and CO Gas Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A lack of targeting accuracy and radiosensitivity severely limit clinical radiotherapy. In this study, we developed Ru&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic nanostructures (MONs) radiosensitizer (ZrRuMn&#8208;MONs@mem) to optimize irradiation by maximizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and CO release in X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced dynamic therapy (XDT). The well&#8208;designed nanostructures increase the direct absorption of radiation doses (primary radiation) and promote the deposition of photons and electrons (secondary radiation). Intriguingly, the secondary electrons were trapped and transferred in this constrained MONs and induce a cascade of reactions to increase the therapeutic efficiency. Meanwhile, the full&#8208;length antiglypican 3 (GPC3) antibody (hGC33) expressed cell membrane coating enabled actively tumor sites targeting with optimized biocompatibility. These results indicate that the ZrRuMn&#8208;MONs@mem represent a starting point for advancing an all&#8208;around radiosensitizer to potentiate clinical XDT efficiency.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of non&#8208;racemic 5&#8208;membered cyclic carbonates from abundant alcohols is reported. Conversion of the alcohol into an azanyl carbonate is followed by a chiral&#8208;at&#8208;ruthenium catalyzed cyclization to provide chiral cyclic carbonates in yields of up to 95% and with up to 99% ee. This new synthetic method is proposed to proceed through a nitrene&#8208;mediated intramolecular C(sp  3  )&#8722;H oxygenation which includes a very unusual 1,7&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer within a ruthenium nitrenoid intermediate. The method is applicable to the synthesis of non&#8208;racemic chiral mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisubstituted cyclic alkylene carbonates.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Degradation of Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich Cathode and Regulation Mechanism by Atomic Layer Deposition in Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathode (SC&#8208;NCM) has attracted increasing interest owing to its greater capacity retention in advanced solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs), while suffers from severe structural instability during cycling. Here, via atomic layer deposition, Li  3  PO  4&#160;&#160;  is introduced to coat SC&#8208;NCM (L&#8208;NCM), to suppress side reaction and enhance interfacial stability. The dynamic degradation and surface regulation of SC&#8208;NCM&#160;are investigated inside a working SSLB by  in situ  atomic force microscopy (AFM).&#160;We directly observe the uneven cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and surface defects on surface of pristine SC&#8208;NCM particle. Remarkably, the formed amorphous LiF&#8208;rich CEI on L&#8208;NCM&#160;maintains the initial structure of SC&#8208;NCM, and thus endows the battery&#160;with improved cycling stability and excellent rate capability. Such on&#8208;site tracking provides deep insights into surface mechanism and structure&#8208;reactivity correlation of SC&#8208;NCM, and thus benefits the optimizations of SSLBs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Microscopic Origin of Second Harmonic Generation Response: The Spatial Structure of Instantaneous Dipole Moments in Electron Excitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the NLO materials reported herein, an electron transits from the oxygen atom of the valence state to the barium atom of the conduction state caused by the optical excitation. The charge transition generates instantaneous spatial dipole moments, which contribute to the projected SHG. Depending on the arrangement and ambience of the dipole moments, all microscopic SHG integrate into the macroscopic SHG response.







Abstract
A deep understanding on the crucial factors of the enhanced macroscopic second harmonic generation (SHG) in some deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is needed to design new NLO materials. Since an optical process relates to the electron excitation and polarization simultaneously, the instantaneous dipole moments and their structures in excitation should be seriously taken account to seek the principal factor in SHG response. In this work, we study the Ba4B11O20F (BBOF), a NLO material, by using the orbital projection technique. From the projected SHG of our theoretic calculation, we recognize the principal dipole moment of the dominant influence on SHG and the relevant atom groups between which the dipole moment is accommodated. With the conclusion that the dipole moment with the most significant influence on SHG is the one between the oxygen&#8211;boron polyhedral anion group and barium cation, we predict that Ba4Al11O20F (BAOF) has a comparable SHG response.

         <title>Building Square Planar Cobalt (II) complexes via Sodium Mediated Cobaltation of Fluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While cobalt complexes have already shown their potential for C&#8211;H and C&#8211;F bond activation of fluoroarenes, their reactivity as metalating agents via Co&#8211;H exchange towards these substrates has not been explored. Herein, we report a Co(HMDS)  2  [HMDS = N(SiMe  3  )  2  ] system which, when synergistically enhanced via sodium amide Na(HMDS) mediation, can render chemo&#8208; and regioselective cobaltation of a series of fluoroarenes to produce a new class of homoleptic square planar [Na  2  CoAr  4  ] complexes. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the key roles of the Na/Co counterparts in a stepwise sodiation/cobalt transmetalation process, leading to this novel C&#8211;H metalation. Depending on the reaction stoichiometry, this process can occur inter&#8208; or intramolecularly, furnishing transient [NaCo(HMDS)  2  Ar] intermediates which can undergo ligand rearrangement to afford [Na  2  CoAr  4  ] with concomitant formation of Co(HMDS)  2  and [NaCo(HMDS)  3  ].</dc:description>

Structurally, small FA+  occupy the prototypical cavities formed by distorted corner&#8208;sharing PbBr6  octahedra like in FAPbBr3  , while bulky NMDAP2+  cations are confined into the expanded lattices which is defined by a new structural motif composed of eight corner&#8208;sharing PbBr6  octahedra and four edge&#8208;sharing octahedra. This localized lattice expansion from FAPbBr3  creates a new branch of the intriguing 3D hybrid perovskite family, breaking the limits of conventional Goldschmidt tolerance factor rule. Moreover, a high two&#8208;photon absorption (2AP) coefficient of 60.8 cm MW&#8211;1  was demonstrated to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) 800nm illumination, enabling sensitive NIR photoresponse with large on/off ratio (~104  ) as well as favorable stability.</dc:description>

Moreover, a high two-photon absorption (2AP) coefficient of 60.8 cm MW&#8211;1  was demonstrated to near-infrared (NIR) 800nm illumination, enabling sensitive NIR photoresponse with large on/off ratio (~104  ) as well as favorable stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneously Enhanced Hydrophilicity and Stability of a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework via Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification for Water Vapor Sorption/Desorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with large pores often lack sufficient hydrophilicity and stability. A post&#8208;synthetic modification of MOF&#8208;808 with di&#8208;sulfonic acids simultaneously enhances its hydrophilicity and stability while maintaining the high water&#8208;sorption capacity, achieving high swing capacities practical for potential applications, such as water harvesting and adsorptive heat transformations.







Abstract
With increasing demands for high&#8208;performance water sorption materials, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained considerable attention due to their high maximum uptake capacities. In many cases, however, high overall capacity is not necessarily accomplishing high working capacity under operating conditions, due to insufficient hydrophilicity and/or water stability. Herein, we present a post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) of MOF&#8208;808, with di&#8208;sulfonic acids enhancing simultaneously its hydrophilicity and water stability without sacrificing its uptake capacity of &#8776;30&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. Di&#8208;sulfonic acid PSM enabled a shift of the relative humidity (RH) associated with a sharp step in water vapor sorption from 35&#8211;40&#8201;% RH in MOF&#8208;808 to below 25&#8201;% RH. While MOF&#8208;808 lost uptake capacity and crystallinity over multiple sorption/desorption cycles, the di&#8208;sulfonic acid PSM MOF&#8208;808 retained &gt;80&#8201;% of the original capacity. PSM MOF&#8208;808 exhibited good hydrothermal stability up to 60&#8201;&#176;C and high swing capacity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochromic mechanophores visualize stress applied to polymers. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202209225), Christoph Weder, Yoshimitsu Sagara et&#8197;al. demonstrate the first cyclophane mechanophore utilizing charge&#8211;transfer complex emission. Polyurethane elastomer films in which the mechanophore is covalently embedded exhibit instantly reversible emission color change between orange and blue upon deformation. The spatial separation of the luminophore and quencher leads to vivid mechanochromic luminescence.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The isolation of di&#8208;branched alkanes from their isomers is vital in gasoline upgrading to achieve high octane numbers but is significantly challenging and energy&#8208;intensive. Here, we report the highly efficient separation of hexane isomers by combing molecular recognition and size&#8208;sieving in a bismuth&#8208;based MOF, UU&#8208;200. The unique auxetic structure with reentrant honeycomb&#8208;like pore cavities connected by narrow pore windows endows UU&#8208;200 with a complete rejection of di&#8208;branched alkanes and high capacities for linear and mono&#8208;branched isomers. The molecular sieving effect, unprecedented separation selectivities, and excellent efficiencies are proved via adsorption isotherms and breakthrough experiments with high research octane numbers obtained (&gt;96), indicating a benchmark for alkane separation under ambient conditions. The molecular recognition mechanism was unveiled by theoretical simulation and in&#8208;situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Additive with a Rigid Solvation Shell for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite substantial progresses, in aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), developing zinc metal anodes with long&#8208;term reliable cycling capabilities is nontrivial because of dendritic growth and related parasitic reactions on the zinc surface. Here, we exploit the tip&#8208;blocking effect of a scandium (Sc  3+  ) additive in the electrolyte to induce uniform zinc deposition. Additional to the tri&#8208;valency of Sc  3+  , the rigidity of its hydration shell effectively prevents zinc ions from concentrating at the surface tips, enabling highly stable cycling under challenging conditions. The shell rigidity, quantified by the rate constant of the exchange reaction (  k  ex  ), is established as a key descriptor for evaluating the tip&#8208;blocking effect of redox&#8208;inactive cations, explaining inconsistent results when only the valence state is considered. Moreover, the tip&#8208;blocking effect of Sc  3+  is maintained in blends with organic solvents, allowing the zinc anode to cycle reliably even at &#8722;40 &#176;C without corrosion.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite substantial progresses, in aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), developing zinc metal anodes with long-term reliable cycling capabilities is nontrivial because of dendritic growth and related parasitic reactions on the zinc surface.

         <dc:description>Both aryne 1,4&#8208;disubstitution and 1,2,4&#8208;trifunctionalization were accomplished from tertiary amines bearing a penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety. These transformations could directly incorporate a C&#8722;N and a C&#8722;C bond para to each other on an aryne intermediate via a sequential nucleophilic addition and [5,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. When arynes bearing 3&#8208;tethered electrophiles were employed, a cascade regioselective nucleophilic addition, intramolecular cyclization, and remote diastereoselective [5,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement process was observed. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between two C&#8722;H hydrogens on the penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;yl chain and the oxygen anion generated upon N&#8208;nucleophilic annulation reaction in the [5,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement step is responsible for the remote diastereoselective control in this reaction system.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchoring LiCl in the Nanopores of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Ultra&#8208;High Uptake and Selective Separation of Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia (NH3) is an important chemical raw material and a unique carbon&#8208;free fuel with high hydrogen energy density. Thus, NH3 capture, storage, and desorption are of significant importance. However, high capacity capture, low energy desorption, and selective separation of NH3 are still challengs so far. Here, we report high&#8208;performance hybrid sorbents by anchoring LiCl in the nanopores of MIL&#8208;53&#8208;(OH)2 metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). It is found that the optimal composite shows a capture capacity of 33.9 mmol/g NH3at 1.0 bar and 25 &#176;C, which far exceeds the current record among the reported porous materials. Notably, the excellent capture capacity at low pressure and high temperature makes it possible to selectively capture NH3 from NH3/N2, NH3/CO2, and NH3/H2O. It is revealed that synergistic action of NH3 coordination to the highly dispersed Li+ in the MOF nanopores and hydrogen bonding of NH3 with Cl&#8208; account for such an excellent capture and selectivity performance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Nucleic acids are remarkable molecules. In addition to Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing, the different structural motifs of these molecules can bind non&#8208;nucleic acid targets or catalyze chemical reactions. Additionally, nucleic acids are easily modified with different molecules or functional groups. These properties make nucleic acids, particularly DNA, ideally&#8208;suited for use in electrochemical biosensors, both as biorecognition elements and redox reporter probes. In this paper, we will review the historical evolution of nucleic acids as probes in electrochemical biosensors. We will then review the specific examples of nucleic&#8208;acid based biosensors that have been evaluated for clinical use in the areas of infectious disease, cancer, or cardiovascular health.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Copper Cathode for Nonaqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most reported cathodes of nonaqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) host anions via insertion reactions. It is necessary to explore new cathode chemistry to increase the battery energy density. To date, transition metals have yet to be investigated for nonaqueous DIBs, albeit they may offer high capacity in anodic conversion reactions. Here, we report that bulk copper powder exhibits a high reversible capacity of 762 mAh/g at 3.2 V vs. Li  +  /Li and relatively stable cycling in common organic electrolytes. The operation of the copper electrode is coupled with the transfer of anion charge carriers. An anion exchange membrane separator is employed to prevent Cu  2+  from crossing from the catholyte to the anode side. We designed an unbalanced electrolyte with a more concentrated anolyte than a catholyte. This addresses the concentration overpotential ensued during charge and facilitates the high specific capacity and enhanced reversibility. This finding provides a promising direction for high&#8208;energy DIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Fluorophore&#8208;Based Organic Crystals with Distinct Conformers Enabling Wide&#8208;Range Excitation&#8208;Dependent Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a simple and generalizable molecular platform that exhibits three emission bands in the crystalline states. The emission maximum can be tuned over a wide range (&#8819;230&#8197;nm) by varying excitation wavelengths. Diverse conformations in S0 and three local minima in S1 are crucial to these unique luminescent properties.







Abstract
Achieving wide&#8208;range tunable emission colors, especially in the solid state of single&#8208;fluorophore materials, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a molecular design strategy that affords wide&#8208;range excitation&#8208;dependent emissions spanning over &#8776;230&#8197;nm in crystalline states. Under the donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor configuration, we judiciously choose a rotatable acceptor fragment, o&#8208;carborane, to enrich conformational diversities in the crystalline state and generate conformation&#8208;dependent multicolor emissions. We further show that this molecular platform is generalizable in creating crystalline materials with multicolor emissions. Based on these materials, a high&#8208;capacity information storage device and a finite&#8208;state machine were fabricated to showcase multicolor displays and information storage.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Functional Evaluation of IORs, Sulfonolipid&#8208;based Inhibitors of Cell Differentiation in Salpingoeca rosetta</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and modular synthesis of the rosette&#8208;inhibitor sulfonolipid IOR&#8208;1A and chemical probes was achieved via decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of a desymmetrized tartaric acid derivatives and alkyl zinc reagents of choice. Synthesized congeners and bifunctional probes allowed to determine structure&#8208;activity relation to profile binding partners in producer and recipient for the first time.







Abstract
The choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta is an important model system to study the evolution of multicellularity. In this study we developed a new, modular, and scalable synthesis of sulfonolipid IOR&#8208;1A (six steps, 27&#8201;% overall yield), which acts as bacterial inhibitor of rosette formation in S.&#8197;rosetta. The synthesis features a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of a sulfonic acid&#8208;containing tartaric acid derivative with alkyl zinc reagents. Synthesis of 15 modified IOR&#8208;1A derivatives, including fluorescent and photoaffinity&#8208;based probes, allowed quantification of IOR&#8208;1A, localization studies within S.&#8197;rosetta cells, and evaluation of structure&#8208;activity relations. In a proof of concept study, an inhibitory bifunctional probe was employed in proteomic profiling studies, which allowed to deduce binding partners in bacteria and S.&#8197;rosetta. These results showcase the power of synthetic chemistry to decipher the biochemical basis of cell differentiation processes within S.&#8197;rosetta.

     alt="Total Synthesis and Functional Evaluation of IORs, Sulfonolipid-based Inhibitors of Cell Differentiation in Salpingoeca rosetta"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new and modular synthesis of the rosette-inhibitor sulfonolipid IOR-1A and chemical probes was achieved via decarboxylative cross-coupling reaction of a desymmetrized tartaric acid derivatives and alkyl zinc reagents of choice. Synthesized congeners and bifunctional probes allowed to determine structure-activity relation to profile binding partners in producer and recipient for the first time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choanoflagellate &lt;i&gt;Salpingoeca rosetta&lt;/i&gt; is an important model system to study the evolution of multicellularity. In this study we developed a new, modular, and scalable synthesis of sulfonolipid IOR-1A (six steps, 27&#8201;% overall yield), which acts as bacterial inhibitor of rosette formation in &lt;i&gt;S.&#8197;rosetta&lt;/i&gt;. The synthesis features a decarboxylative cross-coupling reaction of a sulfonic acid-containing tartaric acid derivative with alkyl zinc reagents. Synthesis of 15 modified IOR-1A derivatives, including fluorescent and photoaffinity-based probes, allowed quantification of IOR-1A, localization studies within &lt;i&gt;S.&#8197;rosetta&lt;/i&gt; cells, and evaluation of structure-activity relations. In a proof of concept study, an inhibitory bifunctional probe was employed in proteomic profiling studies, which allowed to deduce binding partners in bacteria and &lt;i&gt;S.&#8197;rosetta&lt;/i&gt;. These results showcase the power of synthetic chemistry to decipher the biochemical basis of cell differentiation processes within &lt;i&gt;S.&#8197;rosetta&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Fluorinated and Robust Superhydrophobic Modification on Covalent Organic Framework for Crude&#8208;Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Water Emulsion Separation</title>

         <dc:description>
Schiff base condensation and 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reactions are used to develop and decorate a new covalent organic framework (COF) to associate superhydrophobicity, that performs at severe settings. The embedded superhydrophobicity was used for cleaning oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions, irrespective of nature of selected oils and used surfactants.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) having high specific surface area, tunable pore size and high crystallinity are mostly post modified following fluorine&#8208;based and complex synthetic approaches to achieve a bio&#8208;inspired liquid wettability, i.e. superhydrophobicity. Herein, a facile, non&#8208;fluorinated and robust chemical approach is introduced for tailoring the water wettability of a new COF&#8212;which was prepared through Schiff&#8208;base condensation reaction. A silane precursor was readily reacted with selected alkyl acrylates through 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reaction, prior to grafting on the prepared C4&#8208;COF for tailoring different water wettability&#8212;including robust superhydrophobicity. The superhydrophobic C4&#8208;COF (SH&#8208;C4&#8208;COF) that displayed significantly enhanced (&gt;5&#8197;times; from 220&#8197;wt.&#8201;% to 1156&#8197;wt.&#8201;%) oil&#8208;absorption capacity, was extended to address the relevant challenges of &#8220;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8221; emulsion separation, rapidly (&lt;1&#8197;minute) and repetitively (50&#8197;times) at diverse and harsh conditions.

         <title>Synergistic Charge Percolation in Conducting Polymers Enables High&#8208;Performance In Vivo Sensing of Neurochemical and Neuroelectrical Signals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a universal approach that endows conducting polymer (PEDOT:PSS)&#8208;based fiber&#8208;microsensors with an interiorly constructed synergistic charge percolation highway for (i)&#8197;selective and sensitive sensing of a target neurochemical (vitamin C) and (ii)&#8197;high&#8208;fidelity sensing of neuronal activities. This strategy is validated through in vivo applications in the nervous system.







Abstract
Challenges remain in establishing a universal method to precisely tune electrochemical properties of conducting polymers for multifunctional neurosensing with high selectivity and sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate a facile and general approach to achieving synergistic charge percolation in conducting polymers (i.e., poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT:PSS) by incorporating conductive catalysts (i.e., carbon nanotubes, CNTs) and post&#8208;processing. The approach shows synergistic effects: (i)&#8197;CNTs and post&#8208;processing together promote PEDOT ordered interconnection for highly efficient charge percolation that accelerates electrochemical kinetics; (ii)&#8197;CNTs catalyze the electrooxidation of vitamin C for selective electrochemical sensing; (iii)&#8197;CNTs enhance the charge storage/injection capacity of PEDOT:PSS. The prepared CNT&#8208;PEDOT:PSS fiber mechanically matches with neural tissues and is proved to be a biocompatible versatile microsensor capable of high&#8208;performance neurosensing in vivo.

Abstract
We report herein a rare example of enantiodivergent aldehyde addition with &#946;&#8208;alkenyl allylic boronates via chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. 2,6&#8208;Di&#8208;9&#8208;anthracenyl&#8208;substituted chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylation using &#946;&#8208;vinyl substituted allylic boronate gave alcohols with R absolute configuration. The sense of asymmetric induction of the catalyst in these reactions is opposite to those in prior reports. Moreover, in the presence of the same acid catalyst, the reactions with &#946;&#8208;2&#8208;propenyl substituted allylic boronate generated homoallylic alcohol products with S absolute configuration. Unusual substrate&#8208;catalyst C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in the favoured reaction transition state were identified as the origins of observed enantiodivergence through DFT computational studies.

         <title>Dehydrogenation of Ammonia Borane by Platinum&#8208;Nickel Dimers: Regulation of Heteroatom Interspace Boosts Bifunctional Synergetic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pt1Ni1/C3N4 dimeric catalyst exhibits a much higher activity than Pt1/C3N4 in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane for hydrogen generation. A bifunctional synergy is revealed in which the bridging OH in Pt1Ni1 oxo dimers promotes H2O dissociation, while Pt1 facilitates the cleavage of the B&#8722;H bond, thus cooperatively accelerating hydrogen production.







Abstract
Regulation of the atom&#8208;atom interspaces of dual&#8208;atom catalysts is essential to optimize the dual&#8208;atom synergy to achieve high activity but remains challenging. Herein, we report an effective strategy to regulate the Pt1&#8208;Ni1 interspace to achieve Pt1Ni1 dimers and Pt1+Ni1 heteronuclear dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts (HDSACs) by tailoring steric hindrance between metal precursors during synthesis. Spectroscopic characterization reveals obvious electron transfers in Pt1Ni1 oxo dimers but not in Pt1+Ni1 HDSAC. In the hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB), the H2 formation rates show an inverse proportion to the Pt1&#8208;Ni1 interspace. The rate of Pt1Ni1 dimers is &#8776;13 and 2&#8197;times higher than those of Pt1 and Pt1+Ni1 HDSAC, manifesting the interspace&#8208;dependent synergy. Theoretical calculations reveal that the bridging OH group in Pt1Ni1 dimers promotes water dissociation, while Pt1 facilitates the cleavage of B&#8722;H bonds in AB, which boosts a bifunctional synergy to accelerate H2 production cooperatively.

Theoretical calculations reveal that the bridging OH group in Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; dimers promotes water dissociation, while Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; facilitates the cleavage of B&#8722;H bonds in AB, which boosts a bifunctional synergy to accelerate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production cooperatively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Flammable Ester Electrolyte with Boosted Stability Against Li for High&#8208;Performance Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte with NO3&#8722; readily involved in the Li+ solvation sheath that reduces the polarity of solvent and therefore boosts the stability of electrolyte against Li metal. The electrolyte has low viscosity, high ionic conductivity and is low cost. The Li plating/stripping reversibility in Li&#8208;Cu cell was improved to 99.49&#8201;%.







Abstract
In traditional non&#8208;flammable electrolytes a trade&#8208;off always exists between non&#8208;flammability and battery performance. Previous research focused on reducing free solvents and forming anion&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase. However, the contribution of solvated anions in boosting the stability of electrolyte has been overlooked. Here, we resolve this via introducing anions into Li+ solvation sheaths using anions with similar Gutmann donor number (DN) to that of solvents. Taking trimethyl phosphate fire&#8208;retardant (DN=23.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and NO3&#8722; (DN=22.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) as an example, NO3&#8722; is readily involved in the Li+ solvation sheath and reduces the polarity of solvent. This results in boosted stability of electrolyte against Li. The developed non&#8208;flammable electrolyte has low viscosity, high ionic conductivity and is low cost. The reversibility of Li&#8208;Cu cell was improved to 99.49&#8201;% and the lifespan of practical LMBs was extended by &gt;100&#8201;%.

         <title>On Demand Flow Platform for the Generation of Anhydrous Dinitrogen Trioxide and Its Further Use in N&#8208;Nitrosative Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile continuous flow platform for the generation of concentrated dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) solution with accurate and tunable concentration is reported. It unlocks the use of N2O3 in the nitrosative synthesis of heterocycles in flow and batch.







Abstract
Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) is a powerful and efficient nitrosating agent that comes with an unprecedented atom economy. However, the synthetic application of N2O3 is still underdeveloped mostly due to its inherent instability and the lack of reliable protocols for its preparation. This paper presents an open&#8208;source setup and procedure for the on&#8208;demand generation of anhydrous N2O3 solution (up to 1&#8197;M), which can be further used for reactions under batch and flow conditions. The accuracy and stability of N2O3 concentration are guaranteed with the absence of head&#8208;space in the setup and with the synchronization of the gas flows. The reliability of this protocol is demonstrated by &gt;30 worked examples in the nitrosative synthesis of heterocycles&#8212;a library of structurally diverse benzotriazoles and sydnones. Kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the N&#8208;nitrosative steps are also explored.

         <title>Visualization of Protein&#8208;Specific Glycation in Living Cells via Bioorthogonal Chemical Reporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a strategy for visualizing protein&#8208;specific glycation based on bioorthogonal chemical reporter and proximity&#8208;induced FRET signal readout, which provide a powerful tool for analysing protein glycation and their corresponding biological functions in living cells.







Abstract
Due to the lack of suitable chemical tools, probing the protein&#8208;specific glycation is highly challenging. Herein, we present a strategy based on glycation chemical reporter and proximity&#8208;induced FRET signal readout for visualizing protein&#8208;specific glycation in living cells. We first developed a bioorthogonal glucose analogue, 6&#8208;azido&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;glucose (6AzGlc), as a novel glycation chemical reporter. Two types of DNA probes, glycation conversion probe and protein targeting probe, were designed to attach to glycation adducts and target proteins, respectively. After the protein was glycated by 6AzGlc, two DNA probes were sequentially applied to the target protein, triggering proximity&#8208;induced FRET signal readout. This strategy was successfully used to visualize glucose glycation of several proteins, including PD&#8208;L1 and integrin. More importantly, this strategy allowed us to analyze corresponding biological functions of glycated protein in the native environment.

         <title>Missing&#8208;linker Defects in Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Efficient CO2 Separation</title>

The defect engineering strategy is developed for the bottom&#8208;up fabrication of facilitated transport covalent organic framework membranes with missing&#8208;linker defects for efficient CO2 separation.







Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with tunable ordered channels and free organic groups hold great promise in molecular separations owing to the synergy of physical and chemical microenvironments. Herein, we develop a defect engineering strategy to fabricate COF membranes for efficient CO2 separation. Abundant amino groups are in situ generated on the COF nanosheets arising from the missing&#8208;linker defects during the reactive assembly of amine monomer and mixed aldehyde monomers. The COF nanosheets are assembled to fabricate COF membranes. Amino groups, as the CO2 facilitated transport carriers, along with ordered channels endow COF membrane with high CO2 permeances exceeding 300&#8197;GPU and excellent separation selectivity of 80 for CO2/N2, and 54 for CO2/CH4 mixed gas under humidified state. Our defect engineering strategy offers a facile approach to generating free organic functional groups in COF membranes and other organic framework membranes for diverse chemical separations.

A &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy for the structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of hyperbranched polymers based on a &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer, containing both a furan&#8208;protected maleimide (FMI) monomer and a haloalkane initiator, is presented. Due to the dynamic nature of the r&#8208;DA reaction of FMI, the release of maleimide (MI) and the subsequent copolymerization of MI can be regulated by tuning the temperature and stereochemistry during its SCVCP.







Abstract
An efficient &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy for the structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) based on a &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer (LI&#8208;Br), containing a furan&#8208;protected maleimide monomer and a haloalkane initiator, is presented. At high temperatures, the &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer is converted to a &#8220;real&#8221; inimer after releasing maleimide (MI) via a retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (r&#8208;DA) reaction and then copolymerized with methyl methacrylate by self&#8208;condensing vinyl copolymerization. Due to the dynamic characteristic of the r&#8208;DA reaction, the release of naked MI and the subsequent copolymerization can be regulated by the temperature or stereochemistry of Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) adducts. Thus, the &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of HBPs with various degrees of branching was achieved. By further implementation of a programmable temperature change, some valuable hyperbranched topologies such as star&#8208;shaped and long&#8208;chain hyperbranched polymers can be constructed avoiding sophisticated synthetic routes.

         <title>Electrochemically Initiated Synthesis of Methanesulfonic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of methanesulfonic acid was achieved from only methane and oleum in an electrochemical reactor. At the boron&#8208;doped diamond anode the species is formed, which initiates the catalytic cycle where methane is selectively sulfonated to the product. A concentration of 3.7&#8197;M (approximately 62&#8201;% yield) was achieved at 70&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8197;bar methane pressure in 22&#8197;hours.







Abstract
The direct sulfonation of methane to methanesulfonic acid was achieved in an electrochemical reactor without adding peroxide initiators. The synthesis proceeds only from oleum and methane. This is possible due to in situ formation of an initiating species from the electrolyte at a boron&#8208;doped diamond anode. Elevated pressure, moderate temperature and suitable current density are beneficial to reach high concentration at outstanding selectivity. The highest concentration of 3.7&#8197;M (approximately 62&#8201;% yield) at 97&#8201;% selectivity was reached with a stepped electric current program at 6.25&#8211;12.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 70&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8197;bar methane pressure in 22&#8197;hours. We present a novel, electrochemical method to produce methanesulfonic acid, propose a reaction mechanism and show general dependencies between parameters and yields for methanesulfonic acid.

         <title>Olefin&#8211;Borane Interactions in Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;Acceptor Fluorophores that Undergo Frustrated&#8208;Lewis&#8208;Pair&#8208;Type Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Olefin&#8211;borane interaction can be used to modulate the electron&#8208;accepting ability of boron&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;electron materials. Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor fluorophores with alkenyl&#8208;bridged diarylboryl groups exhibit response even to a bulky Lewis base through a frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP)&#8208;type addition. Reversible association/dissociation behavior of the adduct is observed in response to temperature over a range above ambient temperature.







Abstract
Olefin&#8211;borane &#960;&#8208;complexes have been postulated as intermediates for the addition of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) to olefins. In the present study, we have employed this weak interaction to modulate the electronic properties of boron&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;electron materials. A series of donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A) fluorophores that contain an alkenyl&#8208;bridged diarylboryl group is synthesized. A crystallographic analysis revealed that the olefin and boron moieties are held in close proximity. Upon addition of a Lewis base to a solution of these D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A fluorophores, an FLP&#8208;type addition occurs with concurrent significant changes in the absorption and emission properties. The FLP&#8208;type reaction shifts the reaction site from the Lewis&#8208;acidic boron atom to a carbocationic center, and thereby even facilitates a reaction with bulky Lewis bases. For example, a tricyclohexylphosphine adduct thus generated exhibits temperature&#8208;dependent reversible dissociation/association behavior. These results provide a design strategy for stimuli&#8208;responsive emissive boron&#8208;based materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogues and Their Oxide Family as Sulfur Hosts for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) from binary to high&#8208;entropy was fabricated by a facile coprecipitation method. When used as sulfur hosts, high&#8208;entropy PBA can act as polysulfide immobilizers and catalysts to achieve high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Moreover, metal oxides derived from high&#8208;entropy PBA possess good electronic properties, which can prompt the further research of high&#8208;entropy PBA derivatives.







Abstract
The introduction of high&#8208;entropy into Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) has yet to attract attention in the field of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery materials. Herein, we systematically synthesize a library of PBAs from binary to high&#8208;entropy by a facile coprecipitation method. The coordination environment in PBAs is explored by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, which together with elemental mapping confirm the successful introduction of all metals. Importantly, electrochemical tests demonstrate that high&#8208;entropy PBA can serve as polysulfide immobilizer to inhibit shuttle effect and as catalyst to promote polysulfides conversion, thereby boosting its outstanding performance. Additionally, a variety of nanocubic metal oxides from binary to senary are fabricated by using PBAs as sacrificial precursors. We believe that a wide range of new materials obtained from our coprecipitation and pyrolysis methodology can promote further developments in research on PBA systems and sulfur hosts.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Nitric Oxide for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical system employing a rationally designed single&#8208;iron atom based biomimetic catalyst (Fe SAC) is developed for high&#8208;efficient and controlled generation of nitric oxide (NO). The effectiveness of NO generation system underscores a great promise to expedite NO research in both therapeutic and mechanistic applications.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) constitutes one of the most versatile therapeutics for biomedical applications. The efficient and on&#8208;demand NO generation essentially dictates its concentration dependent therapeutic activity. Here, we report an electrochemical system employing a rationally designed single&#8208;iron atom based biomimetic catalyst (i.e., Fe SAC), for high&#8208;efficient and controlled NO generation. The Fe SAC shows superior catalytic ability in electrochemical reduction of nitrite, with maximal NO generation rate achieving 2.1&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;(min&#8201;&#956;g)&#8722;1. Theoretical studies suggest the significant decrease of Gibbs&#8208;free energy of NO2&#8722; adsorption on single&#8208;iron atom accounts for its high catalytic efficiency. Moreover, ample amount of NO can be controllably generated in a potential dependent manner. For antibacterial application, the generated NO overwhelmingly disrupts both gram&#8208;negative and gram&#8208;positive strains, highlighting a great promise to expedite NO research in both basic and applied sciences.

         <title>Strong Anharmonicity&#8208;Induced Low Thermal Conductivity and High n&#8208;type Mobility in the Topological Insulator Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low lattice thermal conductivity and high electron mobility provide promising thermoelectric performance in a 3D topological insulator, Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S. The low thermal conductivity originates from the strong anharmonicity, while the high carrier mobility results from metallic suface states in the topological insulator.







Abstract
Intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) while maintaining the high carrier mobility (&#956;) is of the utmost importance for thermoelectrics. Topological insulators (TI) can possess high &#956; due to the metallic surface states. TIs with heavy constituents and layered structure can give rise to high anharmonicity and are expected to show low &#954;lat. Here, we demonstrate that Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S (BSTS), which is a 3D bulk TI, exhibits ultra&#8208;low &#954;lat of 0.46&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 along with high &#956; of &#8776;401&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Sound velocity measurements and theoretical calculations suggest that chemical bonding hierarchy and high anharmonicity play a crucial role behind such ultra&#8208;low &#954;lat. BSTS possesses low energy optical phonons which strongly couple with the heat carrying acoustic phonons leading to ultra&#8208;low &#954;lat. Further, Cl has been doped at the S site of BSTS which increases the electron concentration and reduces the &#954;lat resulting in a promising n&#8208;type thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of &#8776;0.6 at 573&#8197;K.

         <title>High&#8208;Power Near&#8208;Neutral Aqueous All Organic Redox Flow Battery Enabled with a Pair of Anionic Redox Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance aqueous organic redox flow battery (AORFB) operating upon a pair of judiciously designed anionic viologen and TEMPO derivatives, endows the near&#8208;neutral electrolyte systems with compatibility to the cation&#8208;exchange membrane (CEM), high cell voltage, excellent cycling stability and record&#8208;high power density.







Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are regarded as a promising alternative for low&#8208;cost and durable grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the narrow potential gap, chemical lability and membrane fouling in most AORFBs constitute formidable roadblocks for practical applications. Herein, a pair of anionic organic molecules, namely (PPBPy)Br2 and PSS&#8208;TEMPO, are proposed. The (PPBPy)Br2 in anolyte reveals remarkable electrochemical stability without degradation after 1000&#8197;cycles, while PSS&#8208;TEMPO in catholyte presents a capacity decay rate as low as 0.012&#8201;%/cycle. At near&#8208;neutral conditions, the (PPBPy)Br2/PSS&#8208;TEMPO flow cell exhibits a high voltage of 1.61&#8197;V, extremely low permeability across cation&#8208;exchange membrane and thus excellent cycling stability. Notably, a highest peak power density of 509&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 has been achieved among reported all&#8208;organic aqueous RFBs. The molecular engineering strategies demonstrated here could provide a credible example of high&#8208;performance AORFBs.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Synthetic Glycoconjugate Vaccine Lead Against Acinetobacter baumannii 17978</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

Sixteen oligosaccharides resembling the capsular polysaccharide of A. baumannii 17978 are the basis for serum and antibody screening to identify a vaccine lead.







Abstract
Acinetobacter baumannii is a opportunistic bacterial pathogen responsible for serious nosocomial infections that is becoming increasingly resistant against antibiotics. Capsular polysaccharides (CPS) that cover A. baumannii are a major virulence factor that play an important role in pathogenesis, are used to assign serotypes and provide the basis for vaccine development. Synthetic oligosaccharides resembling the CPS of A. baumannii 17978 were printed onto microarray slides and used to screen sera from patients infected with A. baumannii as well as a monoclonal mouse antibody (mAb C8). A synthetic oligosaccharide emerged from glycan array screening as lead for the development of a vaccine against A. baumannii 17978. Tetrasaccharide 20 is a key epitope for recognition by an antibody and is a vaccine lead.

         <title>A Long&#8208;Circulating Vector for Aptamers Based upon Polyphosphodiester&#8208;Backboned Molecular Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottlebrush polymer&#8208;aptamer biohybrid, termed PSP pacDNA, is prepared using solid&#8208;phase and graft&#8208;onto methodologies. Consisting of a polyphosphodiester backbone and poly(ethylene glycol) side chains, the PSP pacDNA suppresses non&#8208;specific interactions with the cell and improves the plasma pharmacokinetics of the aptamer. Combined with a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer, the PSP pacDNA produces a pronounced anticoagulation effect in vivo.







Abstract
Aptamers face challenges for use outside the ideal conditions in which they are developed. These difficulties are most palpable in vivo due to nuclease activities, rapid clearance, and off&#8208;target binding. Herein, we demonstrate that a polyphosphodiester&#8208;backboned molecular brush can suppress enzymatic digestion, reduce non&#8208;specific cell uptake, enable long blood circulation, and rescue the bioactivity of a conjugated aptamer in vivo. The backbone along with the aptamer is assembled via solid&#8208;phase synthesis, followed by installation of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) side chains using a two&#8208;step process with near&#8208;quantitative efficiency. The synthesis allows for precise control over polymer size and architecture. Consisting entirely of building blocks that are generally recognized as safe for therapeutics, this novel molecular brush is expected to provide a highly translatable route for aptamer&#8208;based therapeutics.

Circular polarized light is utilized in communication and display technologies and a major challenge is to develop systems that can be switched between left and right circular polarized luminescence with high degrees of polarization and enable multiple addressable stable states. Luminescent dyes in Liquid Crystal (LC) cholesteric phases are attractive systems to generate, amplify and modulate circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). In the present study, we employ light&#8208;driven molecular motors as photo&#8208;controlled chiral dopants in LCs to switch the handedness of the LC and the circular polarization of luminescence from an achiral dye embedded in the mesogenic material. Tuning of the color of the CPL and the retention time of the photoprogrammed helicity is demonstrated making use of a variety of motors and dyes. The flexibility offered by the design based on inherently chiral unidirectional rotary motors provides full control over CPL non&#8208;invasively by light, opening possibilities for pixilated displays with externally addressable polarization.

         <title>Closed Aromatic Tubes&#8212;Capsularenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arenes can now be incorporated into closed tubes&#8212;capsularenes. These rigid, electron deficient, thermally stable, and tubular molecules with three arenes or acenes at a close distance can lend themselves to the construction of organic electronic devices.







Abstract
In this study, we describe a synthetic method for incorporating arenes into closed tubes that we name capsularenes. First, we prepared vase&#8208;shaped molecular baskets 4&#8211;7. The baskets comprise a benzene base fused to three bicycle[2.2.1]heptane rings that extend into phthalimide (4), naphthalimide (6), and anthraceneimide sides (7), each carrying a dimethoxyethane acetal group. In the presence of catalytic trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), the acetals at top of 4, 6 and 7 change into aliphatic aldehydes followed by their intramolecular cyclization into 1,3,5&#8208;trioxane (1H NMR spectroscopy). Such ring closure is nearly a quantitative process that furnishes differently sized capsularenes 1 (0.7&#215;0.9&#8197;nm), 8 (0.7&#215;1.1&#8197;nm;) and 9 (0.7&#215;1.4&#8197;nm;) characterized by X&#8208;Ray crystallography, microcrystal electron diffraction, UV/Vis, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, and thermogravimetry. With exceptional rigidity, unique topology, great thermal stability, and perhaps tuneable optoelectronic characteristics, capsularenes hold promise for the construction of novel organic electronic devices.

         <title>Formation and Reactivity of a Fleeting NiIII Bisphenoxyl Diradical Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiII(salen) complexes have been one of the most promising avenues for those aiming to generate high valent Ni species. The present work is a result of one such inquisitiveness where a NiII(salen) complex was treated with mCPBA to form a novel NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species. Various spectroscopic tools and theoretical calculations further assisted our observation. This proposed three electron oxidized species showed oxidation reactivity.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450s and Galactose Oxidases exploit redox active ligands to form reactive high valent intermediates for oxidation reactions. This strategy works well for the late 3d metals where accessing high valent states is rather challenging. Herein, we report the oxidation of NiII(salen) (salen=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;salicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;(1R,2R)&#8208;diamine) with mCPBA (meta&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid) to form a fleeting NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species, in CH3CN and CH2Cl2 at &#8722;40 &#176;C. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses using UV/Vis, EPR, and resonance Raman spectroscopies revealed oxidation events both on the ligand and the metal centre to yield a NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species. DFT calculations found the electronic structure of the ligand and the d&#8208;configuration of the metal center to be consistent with a NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species. This three electron oxidized species can perform hydrogen atom abstraction and oxygen atom transfer reactions.

         <title>Bioinspired Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;Based Ionic Diode Membrane for High&#8208;Efficient Osmotic Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic diode&#8208;type membranes with rectified current can avoid energy dissipation in the nanochannels during the osmotic energy conversion process. Herein, a bioinspired heterogeneous MXene membrane (BHMXM) is designed with extraordinary ionic rectification, when applied in osmotic energy conversion, the BHMXM&#8208;based power generator can yield a high power density of 8.6&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 by mixing synthetic seawater and river water.







Abstract
Bioinspired asymmetric nanofluidic ion channels with ionic diode behavior that can boost the osmotic energy (so&#8208;called blue energy) conversion are highly desirable, especially if they can be easily constructed and modified. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal carbides and nitrides, known as MXenes, combine hydrophilic surfaces and tunable surface charge properties, providing a shortcut to prepare asymmetric nanofluidic ion channels. Here, we report a mechanically robust, flexible, and scale&#8208;up&#8208;friendly asymmetric Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;based ionic diode membrane with a highly rectified current and demonstrate its potential use in reverse electrodialysis osmotic energy conversion. Under the salinity gradient of synthetic seawater and river water, our ionic diode membrane&#8208;based generator&#8216;s power density is 8.6&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 and up to 17.8&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 at a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. The design of MXene&#8208;based ionic diode&#8208;type membrane provides a facile and general strategy in developing large&#8208;scale 2D nanofluidics and selective ion transport.

         <title>Reimplementing Guest Shape Sorting of Nonporous Adaptive Crystals via Substituent&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Solid&#8208;Vapor Postsynthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, as a proof of concept we report that guest adsorption selectivity in nonporous adaptive crystals (NACs) can be readily and precisely tuned via a facile substituent&#8208;size&#8208;dependent solid&#8208;vapor postsynthetic modification method. Comprehensive structural analyses confirm that the intermolecular interactions between the host and guest are the major factors in determining the guest selectivity.







Abstract
Postsynthetic modification (PSM) has been widely used in porous crystalline materials to gain better performance in adsorptive separation of gases or hydrocarbons. We here report that guest adsorption selectivity in a kind of nonporous crystalline materials, namely nonporous adaptive crystals (NACs), can be readily and precisely tuned via a facile substituent&#8208;size&#8208;dependent solid&#8208;vapor PSM method. Before PSM, NACs of pillar[4]arene[1]quinone EtP4Q1 show negligible selectivity for C5 hydrocarbons. PSM with a larger substituent, cyclopentylamine, onto EtP4Q1 NACs does not improve the selectivity, while EtP4Q1 NACs after PSM with a slightly smaller substituent, cyclobutylamine, is endowed with very high preference of n&#8208;pentane over cyclopentane. Comprehensive structural analyses confirm that the intermolecular interactions among the host compounds and host&#8211;guest interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate are the two major factors in determining the guest selectivity.

PSM with a larger substituent, cyclopentylamine, onto &lt;b&gt;EtP4Q1&lt;/b&gt; NACs does not improve the selectivity, while &lt;b&gt;EtP4Q1&lt;/b&gt; NACs after PSM with a slightly smaller substituent, cyclobutylamine, is endowed with very high preference of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-pentane over cyclopentane. Comprehensive structural analyses confirm that the intermolecular interactions among the host compounds and host&#8211;guest interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate are the two major factors in determining the guest selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Central Unit Fluorination of Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enables Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells with Over 18&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of CH molecules with a new modification site on the central unit of Y&#8208;series electron acceptors has been designed and synthesized to afford better&#8208;performing organic solar cells (OSCs). Further fluorination on the largely unexplored central unit enabled significantly improved photovoltaic performance with over 18% efficiency for CH6&#8208;based binary OSCs.







Abstract
Halogenation of terminal of acceptors has been shown to give dramatic improvements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Similar significant results could be expected from the halogenation of the central units of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Y&#8208;series acceptors. Herein, a pair of acceptors, termed CH6 and CH4, featuring a conjugation&#8208;extended phenazine central unit with and without fluorination, have been synthesized. The fluorinated CH6 has enhanced molecular interactions and crystallinity, superior fibrillar network morphology and improved charge generation and transport in blend films, thus affording a higher PCE of 18.33&#8201;% for CH6&#8208;based binary OSCs compared to 16.49&#8201;% for the non&#8208;fluorinated CH4. The new central site offers further opportunities for structural optimization of Y&#8208;series molecules to afford better&#8208;performed OSCs and reveals the effectiveness of fluorination on central units.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Aza&#8208;Boron&#8208;Dipyrromethene for Ferroptosis&#8208;Boosted Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cysteine&#8208;responsive Aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene organic nanoparticles are designed to induce ferroptosis and serve as sonosensitizer. These nanoparticles promote ferroptosis&#8208;enhanced sonodynamic therapy, inducing cancer cell death and tumor growth suppression.







Abstract
The presence of apoptosis inhibition proteins renders the cancer cells resistant to apoptosis, severely compromising the antitumor efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Here, an intelligent anticancer nanoplatform based on an Aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dye (denoted as Aza&#8208;BDY) is elaborately established for ferroptosis augmented SDT through cysteine (Cys) starvation. After endocytosis by tumor cells, Aza&#8208;BDY serves as both a ferroptosis inducing agent and a sonosensitizer for tumor treatment. The specific Cys response facilitates the disruption of redox homeostasis and initiation of cellular ferroptosis. Meanwhile, the released sonosensitizer causes efficient SDT and augments ferroptosis under ultrasound irradiation. Detailed in vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of Cys depletion and singlet oxygen (1O2) generation significantly induces cancer&#8208;cell death and suppresses tumor proliferation with a high inhibition rate of 97.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Photocatalytic Removal of the Greenhouse Gas Nitrous Oxide by Liposomal Microreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled liposome microreactors mimic the spatial separation of redox reactions seen in respiration and photosynthesis. Catalytic reduction of the climate heating gas N2O to benign N2 by encapsulated enzyme is driven by irradiation of external carbon dots through an electron transfer pathway defined by a membrane&#8208;spanning cytochrome and redox&#8208;cycling of internal methyl viologen.







Abstract
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse and ozone&#8208;reactive gas for which emissions are growing rapidly due to increasingly intensive agriculture. Synthetic catalysts for N2O decomposition typically contain precious metals and/or operate at elevated temperatures driving a desire for more sustainable alternatives. Here we demonstrate self&#8208;assembly of liposomal microreactors enabling catalytic reduction of N2O to the climate neutral product N2. Photoexcitation of graphitic N&#8208;doped carbon dots delivers electrons to encapsulated N2O Reductase enzymes via a lipid&#8208;soluble biomolecular wire provided by the MtrCAB protein complex. Within the microreactor, electron transfer from MtrCAB to N2O Reductase is facilitated by the general redox mediator methyl viologen. The liposomal microreactors use only earth&#8208;abundant elements to catalyze N2O removal in ambient, aqueous conditions.

         <title>Tetrazine Linkers as Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Tags for General Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Functionalization and C60 Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous UiO&#8208;68 tetrazine metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is used for post&#8208;synthetic ligation chemistry. The central tetrazine rings act as tags for straightforward framework functionalization by a one&#8208;step reaction with alkene, alkyne dienophiles or fullerene. This approach respects the structural integrity of the parent MOF and offers opportunities for functionalization as well as the integration of C60 in crystalline materials.







Abstract
The value of covalent post&#8208;synthetic modification in expanding the chemistry and pore versatility of reticular solids is well documented. Here we use mesoporous crystals of the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) UiO&#8208;68&#8208;TZDC to demonstrate the value of tetrazine connectors for all&#8208;purpose inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder ligation chemistry. Our results suggest a positive effect of tetrazine reticulation over its reactivity for quantitative one&#8208;step functionalization with a broad scope of alkene or alkyne dienophiles into pyridazine and dihydropyridazine frameworks. This permits generating multiple pore environments with diverse chemical functionalities and the expected accessible porosities, that is also extended to the synthesis of crystalline fulleretic materials by covalent conjugation of fullerene molecules.

         <title>Mechanochemically Generated Calcium&#8208;Based Heavy Grignard Reagents and Their Application to Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond&#8208;Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a mechanochemical technique, we have achieved for the first time the generation of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents (Ar&#8722;CaX) from commercially available, unactivated calcium metal without applying any pre&#8208;activation process. Our operationally simple protocol enables the rapid development of novel cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling reactions mediated by arylcalcium nucleophiles under mechanochemical conditions.







Abstract
In sharp contrast to the use of conventional magnesium&#8208;based Grignard reagents (R&#8722;MgX), the application of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents (R&#8722;CaX) in organic synthesis remains poorly explored. This is mainly due to the lack of experimentally simple ways to access such organocalcium nucleophiles from readily available starting materials under mild conditions. Here, we show that a mechanochemical technique using ball milling allows the generation of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents from aryl halides and commercially available calcium metal without complicated pre&#8208;activation processes. Notably, all experimental operations can be carried out in air. Our operationally simple protocol enables the rapid development of novel cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling reactions mediated by arylcalcium nucleophiles, which are rather difficult using conventional Grignard reagents.

     alt="Mechanochemically Generated Calcium-Based Heavy Grignard Reagents and Their Application to Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond-Forming Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a mechanochemical technique, we have achieved for the first time the generation of calcium-based heavy Grignard reagents (Ar&#8722;CaX) from commercially available, unactivated calcium metal without applying any pre-activation process. Our operationally simple protocol enables the rapid development of novel cross-electrophile-coupling reactions mediated by arylcalcium nucleophiles under mechanochemical conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sharp contrast to the use of conventional magnesium-based Grignard reagents (R&#8722;MgX), the application of calcium-based heavy Grignard reagents (R&#8722;CaX) in organic synthesis remains poorly explored. This is mainly due to the lack of experimentally simple ways to access such organocalcium nucleophiles from readily available starting materials under mild conditions. Here, we show that a mechanochemical technique using ball milling allows the generation of calcium-based heavy Grignard reagents from aryl halides and commercially available calcium metal without complicated pre-activation processes. Notably, all experimental operations can be carried out in air. Our operationally simple protocol enables the rapid development of novel cross-electrophile-coupling reactions mediated by arylcalcium nucleophiles, which are rather difficult using conventional Grignard reagents. This method will allow synthetic chemists to readily access the novel and unique reactivity of organocalcium nucleophiles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Between Elemental Match and Mismatch: From K12Ge3.5Sb6 to Salts of (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722;, (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722;, and (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722;</title>

Extraction of the intermetallic phase &#8220;K2GeSb&#8221;, actually comprising the new single&#8208;crystalline compound K12Ge3.5Sb6, yields the long sought&#8208;for binary anion (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722; and larger ones, (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722; and (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722;, which place the Ge/Sb combination at the border of elemental match and mismatch. The yet unknown diversity of these binary species predicts a rich follow&#8208;up chemistry.







Abstract
The solid mixture &#8220;K2GeSb&#8221; was shown to comprise single&#8208;crystalline K12Ge3.5Sb6 (1), a double salt of K5[GeSb3] with carbonate&#8208;like [GeSb3]5&#8722; anions, and the metallic Zintl phase K2Ge1.5. Extraction of 1 with ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine in the presence of crypt&#8208;222 afforded [K(crypt&#8208;222)]+ salts of several novel binary Zintl anions: (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722; (in 2), (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722; (in 3), and in the presence of [AuMePPh3] also (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722; (in 4). The anion in 2 represents a predicted, yet heretofore missing pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral anion. 4 comprises a cluster analogous to (Ge4Bi14)4&#8722; and (Ga2Bi16)4&#8722;, and thus one of the most Sb&#8208;rich binary p&#8208;block anions. The unprecedented cluster topology in 3 can be viewed as a defect&#8208;version of the one in 4 upon following a &#8220;dead end&#8221; of cluster growth. The findings indicate that Ge and Sb atoms are at the border of a well&#8208;matching and a mismatch elemental combination. We discuss the syntheses, the geometric structures, and the electronic structures of the new compounds.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Macrocyclic Triangles into Helicity&#8208;Opposite Nanotwists by Competitive Planar over Point Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar chirality emerging from the restriction rotation of achiral edges in macrocyclic triangles containing chiral vertices has led to chiral self&#8208;assembly. In contrast to solution systems, where chiroptical properties are exclusively dominated by the point chiral vertices, the emerging planar chirality arising from intermolecular stacking controls the chiral self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
While helix has elegant biomimetic structures and functionalities, it still remains a big question how the nanoscale helicity evolved from the molecular chiral building blocks across length scales. Herein, macrocyclic triangles composed of achiral edges and chiral vertices were rationally designed, in which the planar chirality emerged due to the restriction of edge rotation by intermolecular stackings and led to a unique chiral self&#8208;assembly. In contrast to the solution systems where the chiroptical property is exclusively dominated by the point chiral vertices, the emerged planar chirality was found to control the chiral self&#8208;assembly, resulting the nanotwist with the handedness determined by the planar chirality. Our work unveiled the self&#8208;assembly behaviors of macrocyclic conformers for the first time and provided a deep understanding on the macrocyclic chirality evolution including the excited&#8208;state chirality.

         <title>Scaling Catalytic Contributions of Small Self&#8208;Cleaving Ribozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

General base knockout in nucleolytic ribozymes using deazaguanosine&#8208;modified mutants paves the way to scale the relative contributions of the four main strategies (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;) applied in ribozyme general acid base catalysis.







Abstract
Nucleolytic ribozymes utilize general acid&#8208;base catalysis to perform phosphodiester cleavage. In most ribozyme classes, a conserved active site guanosine is positioned to act as general base, thereby activating the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group to attack the scissile phosphate (&#947;&#8208;catalysis). Here, we present an atomic mutagenesis study for the pistol ribozyme class. Strikingly, &#8220;general base knockout&#8221; by replacement of the guanine N1 atom by carbon results in only 2.7&#8208;fold decreased rate. Therefore, the common view that &#947;&#8208;catalysis critically depends on the N1 moiety becomes challenged. For pistol ribozymes we found that &#947;&#8208;catalysis is subordinate in overall catalysis, made up by two other catalytic factors (&#945; and &#948;). Our approach allows scaling of the different catalytic contributions (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;) with unprecedented precision and paves the way for a thorough mechanistic understanding of nucleolytic ribozymes with active site guanines.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Tetracyclic Pyridinium Alkaloid epi&#8208;Tetradehydrohalicyclamine&#8197;B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conquest of a polycyclic marine pyridinium alkaloid was only made possible by the remarkable chemoselectivity profile of contemporary transition metal catalysts that operate in the presence of basic sites. Ni/Ir photoredox catalysis, Mo&#8208;alkylidynes for alkyne metathesis, and an Ir&#8208;catalyzed lactam&#8208;selective hydrosilylation stand out in this regard.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of a tetracyclic marine pyridinium alkaloid hinged on recent advances in chemoselectivity management: While many classical methods failed to afford the perceptively simple pyridine&#8208;containing core of the target, nickel/iridium photoredox dual catalysis allowed the critical C&#8722;C bond to be formed in good yield. Likewise, ring closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) worked well in the presence of the unhindered pyridine despite the innately Lewis acidic Mo(+6) center of the alkylidyne catalyst. Finally, an iridium catalyzed hydrosilylation was uniquely effective in reducing a tertiary amide without compromising an adjacent pyridine and the lateral double bonds; this transformation is largely without precedent. The second strained macrocycle enveloping the core was closed by intramolecular N&#8208;alkylation with formation of the pyridinium unit; the reaction proceeded site&#8208; and chemoselectively in the presence of an a priori more basic tertiary amine.

         <title>A 3D Peptide/[60]Fullerene Hybrid for Multivalent Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent ligand presentation is a powerful strategy for the development of specific binders and inhibitors. Peptide/[60]fullerene hybrids have now been synthesized that exploit the complete substitution of the fullerene scaffold to afford globular structures presenting twelve copies of a peptide ligand for the recognition of E&#8208;selectin.







Abstract
Fully substituted peptide/[60]fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts offer an excellent opportunity for multivalent protein recognition. In contrast to monofunctionalized fullerene hybrids, peptide/[60]fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts display multiple copies of a peptide in close spatial proximity and in the three dimensions of space. High affinity peptide binders for almost any target can be currently identified by in vitro evolution techniques, often providing synthetically simpler alternatives to natural ligands. However, despite the potential of peptide/[60]fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts, these promising conjugates have not been reported to date. Here we present a synthetic strategy for the construction of 3D multivalent hybrids that are able to bind with high affinity the E&#8208;selectin. The here synthesized fully substituted peptide/[60]fullerene hybrids and their multivalent recognition of natural receptors constitute a proof of principle for their future application as functional biocompatible materials.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aryldifluoromethylation of Aryl Halides with Aryldifluoromethyl Trimethylsilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling of aryl halides with aryldifluoromethyl trimethylsilanes is shown to form diaryl difluoromethanes. A simple dialkyl(dimethoxyphenyl)phosphine ligand for palladium, stabilizing &#960;&#8208;interactions between palladium and the difluorobenzyl ligand during reductive elimination, and a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of the silanes enabled the reaction to form diverse products, including those possessing biological activities.







Abstract
Diaryl difluoromethanes are valuable targets for medicinal chemistry because they are bioisosteres of diaryl ethers and can function as replacements for diaryl methane, ketone, and sulfone groups. However, methods to prepare diaryl difluoromethanes are scarce, especially methods starting from abundant aryl halides. We report the Pd&#8208;catalyzed aryldifluoromethylation of aryl halides with aryldifluoromethyl trimethylsilanes (TMSCF2Ar). The reaction occurs when the catalyst contains a simple, but unusual, dialkylaryl phosphine ligand that promotes transmetallation of the silane. Computational studies show that reductive elimination following transmetallation occurs with a low barrier, despite the fluorine atoms on the &#945;&#8208;carbon, due to coordination of the difluorobenzyl &#960;&#8208;system to palladium. The co&#8208;development of a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of the silanes broadened the scope of the process including several applications to the synthesis biologically relevant diaryl difluoromethanes.

         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Oxidative Azidation/Heterocyclization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides under Buffer Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage derivatization was used to construct azide&#8208;substituted tetrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]indole&#8208;containing peptides through a radical azidation/heterocyclization cascade. This electrochemical oxidative strategy could be conducted under mild, efficient, and environmentally friendly conditions in buffer solution.







Abstract
As the aromatic tryptophan (Trp) side chain plays a pivotal role in influencing the structure and function of peptides and proteins, it has become an attractive target for the late&#8208;stage modification of these important biomolecules. Herein, we report an electrochemical approach for late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides containing a Trp side chain through manganese&#8208;catalyzed tandem radical azidation/heterocyclization. This electrochemical oxidative strategy provides access to azide&#8208;substituted tetrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]indole&#8208;containing peptides with broad functional group tolerance, high site selectivity, and good yields of products (up to 87&#8201;%) under mild buffer conditions. Moreover, the modified Trp&#8208;containing peptides bearing an azide functionality are promising building blocks, paving the way for the construction of various derivatives, such as &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry products.

         <title>Cooperative Surface Passivation and Hierarchical Structuring of Zeolite Beta Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of core&#8211;shell zeolite beta (*BEA) produces a zeolite with an epitaxially grown Si&#8208;rich shell on the exterior rim, which passivates the surface reactivity. It is also possible to enhance intracrystalline mesoporosity via secondary hydrothermal treatment by taking advantage of intrinsic silanol defects in *BEA.







Abstract
We report a method to prepare core&#8211;shell zeolite beta (*BEA) with an aluminous core and an epitaxial Si&#8208;rich shell. This method capitalizes on the inherent defects in *BEA crystals to simultaneously passivate acid sites on external surfaces and increase intracrystalline mesoporosity through facile post&#8208;hydrothermal synthesis modification in alkaline media. This process creates more hydrophobic materials by reducing silanol defects and enriching the shell in silica via a combination of dealumination and the relocation of silica from the core to the shell during intracrystalline mesopore formation. The catalytic consequences of *BEA core&#8211;shells relative to conventional analogues were tested using the biomass conversion of levulinic acid and n&#8208;butanol to n&#8208;butyl levulinate as a benchmark reaction. Our findings reveal that siliceous shells and intracrystalline mesopores synergistically enhance the performance of *BEA catalysts.

         <dc:description>
Chiral quinacridines react chemo&#8208; and regioselectively with &#945;&#8208;diazomalonates under RuII/RhII catalysis, up to four times, achieving a stepwise late&#8208;stage multi&#8208;functionalization of the [4]helicene scaffold. Absorption, emission or Br&#248;nsted acidity but also cellular bioimaging are readily tuned. Density&#8208;functional theory elucidates the carbene insertion selectivity and clarifies the importance of conformations in the optical response.







Abstract
Chiral quinacridines react up to four times, step&#8208;by&#8208;step, with &#945;&#8208;diazomalonates under RuII and RhII catalysis. By selecting the catalyst, [CpRu(CH3CN)3][PF6] (Cp=cyclopentadienyl) or Rh2(oct)4, chemo and regioselective insertions of derived metal carbenes are achieved in favor of mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;functionalized malonate derivatives, respectively, (r.r.&gt;49&#8201;:&#8201;1, up to 77&#8201;% yield, 12 examples). This multi&#8208;introduction of malonate groups is particularly useful to tune optical and chemical properties such as absorption, emission or Br&#248;nsted acidity but also cellular bioimaging. Density&#8208;functional theory further elucidates the origin of the carbene insertion selectivity and also showcases the importance of conformations in the optical response.

By selecting the catalyst, [CpRu(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (Cp=cyclopentadienyl) or Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(oct)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, chemo and regioselective insertions of derived metal carbenes are achieved in favor of mono- or bis-functionalized malonate derivatives, respectively, (r.r.&amp;gt;49&#8201;:&#8201;1, up to 77&#8201;% yield, 12 examples). This multi-introduction of malonate groups is particularly useful to tune optical and chemical properties such as absorption, emission or Br&#248;nsted acidity but also cellular bioimaging. Density-functional theory further elucidates the origin of the carbene insertion selectivity and also showcases the importance of conformations in the optical response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Supramolecular Binding Sites in a Chemically Stable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Simultaneous High C2H2 Storage and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel strategy by engineering abundant supramolecular binding sites into a chemically stable HKUST&#8208;1&#8208;like MOF (ZJU&#8208;50a) to achieve simultaneously high C2H2 storage and selectivity, breaking the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity for C2H2/CO2 separation.







Abstract
Developing porous materials to overcome the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity for C2H2/CO2 separation remains a challenge. Herein, we report a stable HKUST&#8208;1&#8208;like MOF (ZJU&#8208;50a), featuring large cages decorated with high density of supramolecular binding sites to achieve both high C2H2 storage and selectivity. ZJU&#8208;50a exhibits one of the highest C2H2 storage capacity (192&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and concurrently high C2H2/CO2 selectivity (12) at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies on gas&#8208;loaded ZJU&#8208;50a crystal unveil that the incorporated supramolecular binding sites can selectively take up C2H2 molecule but not CO2 to result in both high C2H2 storage and selectivity. Breakthrough experiments validated its separation performance for C2H2/CO2 mixtures, providing a high C2H2 recovery capacity of 84.2&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with 99.5&#8201;% purity. This study suggests a novel strategy of engineering supramolecular binding sites into MOFs to overcome the trade&#8208;off for this separation.

         <title>Dearomative Aminocarbonylation of Arenes via Bifunctional Coordination to Chromium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dearomative trifluoromethylative aminocarbonylation of arenes via bifunctional coordination to chromium has been firstly developed for amide construction, which expands the boundary of aminocarbonylations from conventional C=C bond substrates to arenes. Furthermore, a switchable 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of arene C&#8722;H bonds and concise synthesis of amide&#8208;type drug analogs were successfully achieved.







Abstract
Amides are ubiquitous in physical and life sciences. Given the significant abundance of arenes, dearomative aminocarbonylation of arenes would lead to a large and underexplored chemical space for amide discovery. However, such reactions are challenging due to the high degree of resonance stabilization and selectivity issues. Herein, we disclose an unprecedented dearomative trifluoromethylative aminocarbonylation of arenes via bifunctional coordination to chromium, providing a modular platform for the construction of amides possessing trifluoromethyl (CF3) groups and three&#8208;dimensional rings. Its versatility further enabled a switchable difluoromethylation or trifluoromethylation aminocarbonylation of arene C&#8722;H bonds. A possible mechanism was proposed based on control experiments. Finally, the synthetic utility was well demonstrated by diverse applications in the total synthesis of CF3&#8208;functionalized amide&#8208;type drugs, including praziquantel, nateglinide, maraviroc and alloyohimbane.

         <title>Evolution of a Strategy for Concise Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Salinosporamide Family of Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described herein are the total syntheses of salinosporamides and cinnabaramides via a strategy involving rapid construction of the highly decorated pyrrolidinone core of the natural products from the simple amino acid serine. The key to the success of this synthesis was to exploit the innate properties of the serine&#8208;derived 5&#8208;oxazolidinone as a stereochemical controller and unprecedented substrate&#8208;driven hydrolytic dynamic kinetic resolution.







Abstract
Our first strategy for rapidly accessing pyrrolidinone cores of salinosporamides involved combined use of memory of chirality and dynamic kinetic resolution principles in aldol reactions of the serine&#8208;derived 5&#8208;oxazolidinone substrate, which was ultimately unsuccessful with respect to enantioselectivity. This failure led us to the revised strategy. The influence of the stereocenter in 5&#8208;oxazolidinone enabled selective installation of the C&#8208;2 stereocenter. The intramolecular aldol reaction of the C&#8208;2 stereodefined aldol substrate was successful. An unexpected hydrolytic dynamic kinetic resolution was observed in hydrolyses of the bicyclic aldol products. This unprecedented substrate&#8208;driven hydrolytic dynamic kinetic resolution was utilized in preparing the pyrrolidinone core with excellent efficiency. Through this strategy, the concise total syntheses of salinosporamides A and B as well as cinnabaramides A, E, and F were achieved with high selectivity.

         <title>Dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]chalcogenadiazepine Photoswitches: Conversion of Excitation Energy into Ring Strain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen&#8208;bridged seven&#8208;membered cyclic azobenzenes, dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]chalcogenadiazepine (DBChD), exhibit distinct photo&#8208;switching characters with a high&#8208;energy E&#8208;configuration, especially for sulfur&#8208;bridged DBTD with an energy transduction efficiency of 21&#8201;% (&#951;) under 445&#8197;nm laser activation. Introducing oligothiophene &#960;&#8208;EDG on DBTD could further elevate the absorption &#955;max and coefficient &#1013;, reaching &#951;=29&#8201;%.







Abstract
Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted, heteroaryl and cyclic azobenzenes have emerged as three key strategies on morphology design of photoswitch to diversify controllability. Cyclic azobenzene is of particular utilization in photo&#8208;energy conversion due to rigid and ring&#8208;strain structure. Despite the well&#8208;recognized diazocine, the photo&#8208;switching properties of seven&#8208;membered cyclic azobenzenes (diazepines) have yet been exploited. Herein, we report a family of dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]chalcogenadiazepines (DBChDs) and their T&#8208;type photo&#8208;switching nature with tunable relaxation rate. Based on experiments together with DFT calculations, we found that an unsymmetric 2&#8208;bithiophenyl&#8208;dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]thiadiazepine exhibited an efficient response to 445&#8197;nm laser stimulation (quantum efficiency, &#934;Z&#8594;E=0.71) with millisecond relaxation half&#8208;life (t1/2=40&#8197;ms). Photo&#8208;energy transduction efficiency was also exceptionally high with 29.1&#8201;% converted into ring&#8208;strain energy mainly loaded on azo &#960;&#8208;bond.

         <title>Molecular Doping of Flexible Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite&#8208;Polymer Thick Membranes for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

Molecular doping improves the conductivity of flexible lead&#8208;free MA3Bi2I9 perovskite membranes by four times. Flexible X&#8208;ray detector achieves a high sensitivity of 2065&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 2.71&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, a high mechanical robustness, which demonstrate potential in next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detection.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray detectors have broad applications in medicine and industry. Although flexible lead&#8208;free perovskite films are competitive because of their lightweight and low toxicity, they are less efficient due to low charge transport. Herein, we report low&#8208;toxicity, flexible X&#8208;ray detectors based on p&#8208;type doped MA3Bi2I9 (MA=methylammonium) perovskite&#8208;filled membranes (PFMs). Strong coordination between dopant 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4&#8208;TCNQ) and MA3Bi2I9 and the establishment of charge&#8208;transfer complex (CPX) improved the conductivity by four times. The flexible X&#8208;ray detector achieved a high sensitivity of 2065&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 2.71&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is among the highest values in all environmentally friendly flexible X&#8208;ray detectors. Importantly, the PFMs retained excellent charge transport under mechanical stress. All of those make flexible MA3Bi2I9 membranes more competitive as next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detection.

         <title>Synergistic Manipulation of Hydrogen Evolution and Zinc Ion Flux in Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;based Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous Zn&#8208;COF@Zn anodes have been fabricated to synergistically manipulate the H2 evolution and Zn2+ flux, during which the closely related H2 qualification/inhibition and Zn dendrite&#8208;growth in zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries have been studied.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;based aqueous batteries have attracted much attention because of their high theoretical&#8208;capacity, safety, and low&#8208;cost, yet the H2&#8208;evolution, qualification or inhibition mechanism investigations that are closely related to the dendrite&#8208;growth are rare and challenging. Herein, a series of zincophilic metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (e.g., Zn&#8208;AAn&#8208;COF, Zn&#8208;DAAQ&#8208;COF, and Zn&#8208;DAA&#8208;COF) have been explored as model&#8208;platforms to manipulate the H2&#8208;evolution and Zn2+ flux. Best of them, Zn&#8208;AAn&#8208;COF based cell only produces 0.002&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;H2, which is &gt;2 orders of magnitude lower than bare Zn. Noteworthy, it affords high stability for 3000&#8197;cycles (overpotential, &lt;79.1&#8197;mV) at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in symmetric&#8208;cell and enhanced cycling&#8208;stability up to 6000&#8197;cycles at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the assembled full&#8208;battery. Besides, mechanistic characterizations show that Zn&#8208;AAn&#8208;COF can enhance the energy&#8208;barrier of H2&#8208;evolution and homogenize the ion&#8208;distribution or electric&#8208;filed to achieve high performance.

         <title>Asymmetric Oxidative Lactonization of Enynyl Boronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present herein the first oxidation of enynyl boronates for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactones, including spiro&#8208;, and fused&#8208;butanolides as well as butenolides that are prevalent in nature products and bioactive molecules. The asymmetric version of this oxidation was also achieved in the presence of chiral ketone and Oxone. This process successively involves the oxidation of C(sp)&#8722;B bond, the epoxidation of C&#8722;C double bond, and the lactonization.







Abstract
Oxidation of C&#8722;B bonds is extensively used in organic synthesis, materials science, and chemically biology. However, these oxidations are usually limited to the oxidation of C(sp3)&#8722;B and C(sp2)&#8722;B bonds. The C(sp)&#8722;B bond oxidation is rarely developed. Herein we present a novel strategy for the preparation of &#947;&#8208;lactones via the oxidation of enynyl boronates. This process successively involves the C(sp)&#8722;B bond oxidation, the epoxidation of C&#8722;C double bond and the lactonization. This protocol provided various &#947;&#8208;lactones and unsaturated butenolides efficiently that are prevalent in numerous nature products and bioactive molecules. Most importantly, asymmetric oxidative lactonization of enynyl boronates was also achieved, providing chiral &#947;&#8208;lactones in high enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities. The versatile transformations and ubiquity of &#947;&#8208;lactones shed light on the importance of this strategy in the construction and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Single Au Atoms on Ultrathin ZnIn2S4 Nanosheets for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction towards CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single Au atoms in Au1&#8208;S2 low&#8208;coordination structure on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets were prepared by a rational complex&#8208;exchange route. Endowed with much faster interfacial electron transfer from [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 photosensitizer and more appropriate binding strength with *CO intermediates, low&#8208;coordination single Au atoms surpass Au nanoparticles counterpart in CO2 photoreduction, leading to CH4 product with both high activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Selective CO2 photoreduction to hydrocarbon fuels such as CH4 is promising and sustainable for carbon&#8208;neutral future. However, lack of proper binding strengths with reaction intermediates makes it still a challenge for photocatalytic CO2 methanation with both high activity and selectivity. Here, low&#8208;coordination single Au atoms (Au1&#8208;S2) on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets was synthesized by a complex&#8208;exchange route, enabling exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. Under visible light irradiation, Au1/ZnIn2S4 catalyst exhibits a CH4 yield of 275&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity as high as 77&#8201;%. As revealed by detailed characterizations and density functional theory calculations, Au1/ZnIn2S4 with Au1&#8208;S2 structure not only display fast carrier transfer to underpin its superior activity, but also greatly reduce the energy barrier for protonation of *CO and stabilize the *CH3 intermediate, thereby leading to the selective CH4 generation from CO2 photoreduction.

Here, low-coordination single Au atoms (Au&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) on ultrathin ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets was synthesized by a complex-exchange route, enabling exceptional photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction performance. Under visible light irradiation, Au&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibits a CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 275&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a selectivity as high as 77&#8201;%. As revealed by detailed characterizations and density functional theory calculations, Au&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with Au&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure not only display fast carrier transfer to underpin its superior activity, but also greatly reduce the energy barrier for protonation of *CO and stabilize the *CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate, thereby leading to the selective CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; generation from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Ultrastable Nonsubstituted Quinoline&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Frameworks via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidant&#8208;free locking of a dynamic imine bridge to construct the ultrastable nonsubstituted quinoline&#8208;linked COFs via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation is reported. This methodology features high efficiency, generality, retention of crystallinity and topology. The enhanced in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation facilitates photocatalytic organic transformations mediated by superoxide anion radicals.







Abstract
Exploring new routes to lock the dynamic C=N bonds in imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is highly desired for enhancing their stability and functionality. Herein, a novel C=N bridge locking strategy via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation is developed to construct nonsubstituted quinoline&#8208;linked COFs (NQ&#8208;COFs). The notable feature of this strategy includes high C=N conversion efficiency, oxidant&#8208;free, and generality for synthesis of a variety of NQ&#8208;COFs with high chemical stability. Particularly, after post&#8208;synthetic modification, the crystallinity, topology, and porosity of pristine imine&#8208;linked COFs are well retained. When used as photocatalysts, NQ&#8208;COFs display better visible light absorption and carriers&#8217; separation efficiency due to enhanced in&#8208;plane &#960; conjugation ability, as well as more facile generation of superoxide anion radicals than their counterparts, thus leading to efficient synthesis of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(aryl)pyridines, benzimidazole, and sulfoxide derivatives.

         <title>Open&#8208;Bandgap Graphene&#8208;Based Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Using Oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene) Interfacial Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amine&#8208;functionalized oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene) (OPE) was introduced as an interface on wafer&#8208;scale graphene in the form of self&#8208;assembled monolayers through anion&#8208;based reaction. The band gap was opened by electron transfer from OPE to graphene via covalent bonding. This property offers high efficiency for graphene&#8208;based transistor applications.







Abstract
Organic interfacial compounds (OICs) are required as linkers for the highly stable and efficient immobilization of bioprobes in nanobiosensors using 2D nanomaterials such as graphene. Herein, we first demonstrated the fabrication of a field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) via a microelectromechanical system process after covalent functionalization on large&#8208;scale graphene by introducing oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene)amine (OPE). OPE was compared to various OICs by density functional theory simulations and was confirmed to have a higher binding energy with graphene and a lower band gap than other OICs. OPE can improve the immobilization efficiency of a bioprobe by forming a self&#8208;assembly monolayer via anion&#8208;based reaction. Using this technology, Magainin I&#8208;conjugated OGMFET (MOGMFET) showed a high sensitivity, high selectivity, with a limit of detection of 100&#8197;cfu&#8201;mL&#8722;1. These results indicate that the OPE OIC can be applied for stable and comfortable interfacing technology for biosensor fabrication.

         <title>Antineoplastic Enzyme as Drug Carrier with Activatable Catalytic Activity for Efficient Combined Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

Glucose oxidase (GOx) as drug carrier delivers anticancer drugs including sorafenib, 4&#8242;&#8208;(amino&#8208;methyl phenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine modified cyanin and paclitaxel. These nanodrugs show acid&#8208;activatable enzyme activity of GOx, thus allowing relatively safe intravenous administration of GOx and effective combination of GOx&#8208;mediated cancer starvation&#8208;like therapy and chemotherapy/photothermal therapy/tumor ferroptosis against 4T1 breast tumors.







Abstract
The delivery of glucose oxidase (GOx) requires extra carriers, which suffers from early leakage and exposure of GOx. These issues will be of less concern if GOx itself acts as a drug carrier. However, the catalytic activity of GOx in the blood still needs to be inhibited. Herein, we found that GOx could self&#8208;assemble with hydrophobic molecules into uniform and stable nanoparticles (NPs), including sorafenib, 4&#8242;&#8208;(amino&#8208;methyl phenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine modified cyanin and paclitaxel. The catalytic activity of GOx in NPs was significantly inhibited due to the binding of small molecules with its hydrophobic pockets. After dissociation in the tumor acidic microenvironment, the enzyme activity of GOx could be largely recovered. This acidity&#8208;triggered &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; process ensured safe intravenous administration of GOx&#8208;based NPs. In vivo experiments showed that the combined starvation therapy and ferroptosis/photothermal therapy/chemotherapy effectively inhibited 4T1 breast tumor growth.

By means of density functional theory calculations, ethynyl&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;phosphinates (ETPs) were discovered as modular and cysteine&#8208;selective electrophiles for bioconjugation. Using CuI&#8208;click chemistry in aqueous buffers, this functional group can be easily introduced into azide&#8208;containing (bio&#8208;)molecules. These reagents can be used for proteome&#8208;wide cysteine profiling and to obtain functional peptide&#8208; and protein conjugates, as well as protein&#8211;protein conjugates .







Abstract
We report the density functional theory (DFT) guided discovery of ethynyl&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;phosphinates (ETPs) as a new class of electrophilic warheads for cysteine selective bioconjugation. By using CuI&#8208;catalysed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) in aqueous buffer, we were able to access a variety of functional electrophilic building blocks, including proteins, from diethynyl&#8208;phosphinate. ETP&#8208;reagents were used to obtain fluorescent peptide&#8208;conjugates for receptor labelling on live cells and a stable and a biologically active antibody&#8208;drug&#8208;conjugate. Moreover, we were able to incorporate ETP&#8208;electrophiles into an azide&#8208;containing ubiquitin under native conditions and demonstrate their potential in protein&#8211;protein conjugation. Finally, we showcase the excellent cysteine&#8208;selectivity of this new class of electrophile in mass spectrometry based, proteome&#8208;wide cysteine profiling, underscoring the applicability in homogeneous bioconjugation strategies to connect two complex biomolecules.

         <title>Hydrolytically Stable Ionic Fluorogels for High&#8208;Performance Remediation of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) from Natural Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis of a library of ion exchange resins that are selective for PFAS removal from real water enabled the evaluation of structure&#8211;property relationships of the chemically stable polymer networks with high PFAS affinity. The granular Ionic Fluorogel resin is a potent PFAS remediation sorbent and demonstrated excellent performance in translationally relevant flow&#8208;through packed bed columns using natural water.







Abstract
PFAS are known bioaccumulative and persistent chemicals which pollute natural waters globally. There exists a lack of granular sorbents to efficiently remove both legacy and emerging PFAS at environmentally relevant concentrations. Herein, we report a class of polymer networks with a synergistic combination of ionic and fluorous components that serve as granular materials for the removal of anionic PFAS from water. A library of Ionic Fluorogels (IFs) with systematic variation in charge density and polymer network architecture was synthesized from hydrolytically stable fluorous building blocks. The IFs were demonstrated as effective sorbents for the removal of 21 legacy and emerging PFAS from a natural water and were regenerable over multiple cycles of reuse. Comparison of one IF to a commercial ion exchange resin in mini&#8208;rapid small&#8208;scale column tests demonstrated superior performance for the removal of short&#8208;chain PFAS from natural water under operationally relevant conditions.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Chemokine Conjugates for In Vivo Targeting of Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the first enzyme&#8208;activatable chemokine conjugates for selective targeting of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages in preclinical models of cancer. We demonstrate that this new chemical design is compatible with both fluorescent and therapeutic payloads, opening avenues in the preparation of future theranostic probes for immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.







Abstract
Increased levels of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) are indicators of poor prognosis in most cancers. Although antibodies and small molecules blocking the recruitment of macrophages to tumors are under evaluation as anticancer therapies, these strategies are not specific for macrophage subpopulations. Herein we report the first enzyme&#8208;activatable chemokine conjugates for effective targeting of defined macrophage subsets in live tumors. Our constructs exploit the high expression of chemokine receptors (e.g., CCR2) and the activity of cysteine cathepsins in TAMs to target these cells selectively over other macrophages and immune cells (e.g., neutrophils, T cells, B cells). Furthermore, we demonstrate that cathepsin&#8208;activatable chemokines are compatible with both fluorescent and therapeutic cargos, opening new avenues in the design of targeted theranostic probes for immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.

First explorations of binary Ge/Sb Zintl anions indicated a situation between a &#8220;matching&#8221; one and one that tends to element segregation owing to a mismatch in atom sizes. Extraction of the ternary solid K12Ge3.5Sb6 allowed access to the so far missing P4&#8208;like anion (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722;, as well as to species that show tendencies for spatial separation of Ge and Sb atoms, &#8220;incomplete&#8221; (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722; and &#8220;complete&#8221; (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722;, as confirmed by DFT calculations and described by Stefanie Dehnen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202207232).

A self&#8208;assembled glucose oxidase (GOx) nanoparticle that falls into the sea and dissociates into several enzymes is depicted in the picture illustrating the Research Article by Peng Huang and co&#8208;workers (e202208583). After dissociation, GOx regains its catalytic activity and catalyzes the oxidization of glucose into gluconic acid and H2O2. It's like someone pressing the &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2&#8221; switch that crosses the sea surface.

         <dc:description>
A ball&#8208;milling approach allows the efficient activation of calcium metal and thus makes the direct generation of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents feasible without complicated pre&#8208;activation processes. By using this operationally simple method, Koji Kubota, Hajime Ito, and co&#8208;workers developed a novel cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling reaction mediated by arylcalcium nucleophiles in their Research Article (e202207118), which is typically difficult using conventional Grignard reagents.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Fibrous Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is challenging to introduce self&#8208;healing properties to fibrous membrane materials owing to the complex healing mechanism and particular porous structure. In this Minireview self&#8208;healing fibrous membranes are introduced and described in detail in terms of design strategies and preparation methods. The current state of the art, existing challenges, and future outlook for this promising field are systematically summarized.







Abstract
Inspired by the self&#8208;healing function of living organisms, self&#8208;healing materials have been developed in recent decades to very high standards. As a new direction, self&#8208;healing fibrous membranes (SFMs) exhibit both the configuration of a porous structure and self&#8208;healing capability within one material. Different from nonporous self&#8208;healing materials, it is more challenging to introduce self&#8208;healing properties to porous fibrous membrane materials owing to the more complex healing mechanism and microstructure of SFMs. This Minireview focuses on the self&#8208;healing mechanisms, design principles, and preparation strategies of SFMs. The characteristics of SFM self&#8208;healing performance are introduced in detail, and insights and perspectives of SFM preparation and healing mechanisms are put forward. Furthermore, remaining challenges and future developments of SFMs are presented, where the ultimate goal is the design of highly efficient self&#8208;healing and superstable fibrous membranes.

         <title>Physical and Chemical Cues at the Nano&#8211;Bio Interface for Immunomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immunomodulation has made tremendous progress in fighting diseases. In the past decade, it was demonstrated that nanomaterials can directly induce immunomodulation. To summarize this emerging research field, we systematically discuss a series of physical and chemical cues at the nano&#8211;bio interface in order to better understand nanomaterials&#8208;regulated immunosignaling pathways as well as the outcomes in disease control and treatment.







Abstract
Immunomodulation has made remarkable progress in fighting infectious disease and cancer. Conventionally, immunomodulation largely relies on chemical/biochemical agents, which, unfortunately, suffer from sever off&#8208;target adverse effects. Recent insights into nano&#8211;bio interactions suggest that nanomaterials can directly participate in immunomodulation. A range of physical and chemical cues at the nano&#8211;bio interface have been harnessed to regulate diverse immuno&#8208;signaling for disease control and treatment. In this Minireview, we summarize recent studies on the physical and chemical cues enabled by intrinsic nanomaterials to trigger immunological signaling. First, we discuss physical cues mediated by surface topography, hydrophobicity, charge, and heat at the nano&#8211;bio interface for immunomodulation. Then, various nanomaterials enabled chemical cues, such as metal species and oxidative species are outlined. Finally, our perspectives on challenges and possible future directions are provided.

         <title>Small&#8208;Molecule Quenchers for F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer: Structure, Mechanism, and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule (dark) quenchers have been widely used as acceptors in FRET&#8208;based probes to monitor various physiological processes with minimum background signal. Herein, we focus on the quenching mechanisms, types, and biomedical applications of these quenchers. We give an in&#8208;depth discussion of their structure&#8211;property relationship and discuss the potentials and challenges of the quenchers in biomedical applications.







Abstract
For fluorogenic probes, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is one of the most widely used mechanisms to realize the detection of biochemical activities. Dark quenchers relax from the excited state to the ground state non&#8208;radiatively, and are promising alternatives to fluorescent FRET acceptors. Small&#8208;molecule (dark) quenchers have been widely used as acceptors in FRET&#8208;based probes to monitor various physiological processes with minimum background signal. Herein, we summarize the relevant advances of small&#8208;molecule quenchers that are used in FRET&#8208;based probes. This Review is intended to provide suggestions regarding the rationale design and selection of appropriate fluorophore&#8211;quencher FRET pairs, which are fully compatible with challenging analytical applications in various biological systems. Finally, an outlook of the future biomedical applications and developments of this field is presented.

         <title>How Subtle Changes Can Make a Difference: Reproducibility in Complex Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of complex systems often coincides with difficult preparation protocols and narrow windows of suitable conditions. In this Scientific Perspective, we report on unexpected observations made in our group that highlight the impact of subtle &#8220;irregularities&#8221; on supramolecular systems. We draw attention to often overlooked details and aim to initiate an open discussion on reproducibility in supramolecular chemistry.







Abstract
The desire to construct complex molecular systems is driven by the need for technological (r)evolution and our intrinsic curiosity to comprehend the origin of life. Supramolecular chemists tackle this challenge by combining covalent and noncovalent reactions leading to multicomponent systems with emerging complexity. However, this synthetic strategy often coincides with difficult preparation protocols and a narrow window of suitable conditions. Here, we report on unsuspected observations of our group that highlight the impact of subtle &#8220;irregularities&#8221; on supramolecular systems. Based on the effects of pathway complexity, minute amounts of water in organic solvents or small impurities in the supramolecular building block, we discuss potential pitfalls in the study of complex systems. This article is intended to draw attention to often overlooked details and to initiate an open discussion on the importance of reporting experimental details to increase reproducibility in supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Tailoring Bond Microenvironments and Reaction Pathways of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disclosing the structure&#8211;reactivity relationships of single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) in water electrolysis is critical to guide the future design, performance optimization, and broad applications of single&#8208;atom catalysts. This Review summarizes the most recent progress in tailoring the bond microenvironment of single&#8208;atom catalysts on different supports and discusses the reaction pathways, mechanisms, and performance advantages of different SAS structures for water electrolysis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) are commonly stabilized and influenced by neighboring atoms in the host; disclosing the structure&#8211;reactivity relationships of SASs in water electrolysis is one of the grand challenges originating from the tremendous wealth of support materials with complex structures. Through a multidisciplinary view of the design principles, synthesis strategies, characterization techniques, and theoretical analysis of structure&#8211;performance correlations, this timely Review is dedicated to summarizing the most recent progress in tailoring bond microenvironments on different supports and discussing the reaction pathways and performance advantages of different SAS structures for water electrolysis. The essence and mechanisms of how SAS structures influence electrocatalysis and the critical requirements for future developments are discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are also provided to stimulate the practical, widespread utilization of SAS catalysts in water&#8208;splitting electrolyzers.

         <title>An Fe6C Core in All Nitrogenase Cofactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Earlier spectroscopic and structural studies have shown that the cofactors of molybdenum and vanadium nitrogenases contain a central &#956;6&#8208;carbide. Here, we used valence&#8208;to&#8208;core X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (VtC XES) to probe the presence of a carbide in the cofactor of iron nitrogenase. The presence of a K&#946;&#8242;&#8242; peak at 7100&#8197;eV reveals an interstitial carbon, showing that the cofactor of Fe nitrogenase contains an Fe6C core.







Abstract
The biological process of dinitrogen reduction to ammonium occurs at the cofactors of nitrogenases, the only enzymes that catalyze this challenging chemical reaction. Three types of nitrogenases have been described, named according to the heterometal in their cofactor: molybdenum, vanadium or iron nitrogenases. Spectroscopic and structural characterization allowed the unambiguous identification of the cofactors of molybdenum and vanadium nitrogenases and revealed a central &#956;6&#8208;carbide in both of them. Although genetic studies suggested that the cofactor of the iron nitrogenase contains a similar Fe6C core, this has not been experimentally demonstrated. Here we report Valence&#8208;to&#8208;Core X&#8208;ray Emission Spectroscopy providing experimental evidence that this cofactor contains a carbide, thereby making the Fe6C core a feature of all nitrogenase cofactors.

         <title>Ketenes in the Induction of the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

Operando synchrotron photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy identifies ketene and methylketene intermediates in methyl acetate conversion over the HZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. The surface acetyl to olefins mechanism proceeds via methylation and decarbonylation processes.







Abstract
Ketene (CH2=C=O) has been postulated as a key intermediate for the first olefin production in the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed chemistry of methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) and syngas&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (STO) processes. The reaction mechanism remains elusive, because the short&#8208;lived ethenone ketene and its derivatives are difficult to detect, which is further complicated by the low expected ketene concentration. We report on the experimental detection of methylketene (CH3&#8722;CH=C=O) formed by the methylation of ketene on HZSM&#8208;5 via operando synchrotron photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy. Ketene is produced in situ from methyl acetate. The observation of methylketene as the ethylene precursor evidences a computationally predicted ketene&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene route proceeding via a methylketene intermediate followed by decarbonylation.

         <title>Rapid Access to Diverse Multicomponent Hierarchical Nanostructures from Mixed&#8208;Graft Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;graft block copolymers containing sequence&#8208;defined side chains were synthesized from three or four different types of macromonomers. The morphology of hierarchical nanostructures assembled from the prepared graft copolymers was readily diversified by varying the sequence, number, and molar ratio of the side chains.







Abstract
Multicomponent nanostructured materials assembled from molecular building blocks received wide attention due to their precisely integrated multifunctionalities. However, discovery of these materials with desirable composition and morphology was limited by their low synthetic scalability and narrow structural tuning window with given building blocks. Here, we report a scalable and diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic approach to hierarchically structured nanomaterials based on a few readily accessible building blocks. Mixed&#8208;graft block copolymers containing sequence&#8208;defined side chains were prepared through ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization of three or four types of macromonomers. Intramolecularly defined interfaces promoted the formation of ordered hierarchical structures with lattice sizes tunable across multiple length scales. The same set of macromonomers were arranged and combined in different ways, providing access to diverse morphologies in the resultant structures.

         <title>Synthetic Reagents for Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naturally occurring members of the thiopurine methyltransferase family have been found to accept synthetic methyl sulfates or methyl sulfonates as methyl donors for the stereoselective methylation of S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine to form S&#8208;adenosylmethionine. This activity can be used for co&#8208;substrate regeneration in methyltransferase biocatalysis.







Abstract
Late&#8208;stage methylation is a key technology in the development of pharmaceutical compounds. Methyltransferase biocatalysis may provide powerful options to insert methyl groups into complex molecules with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. The challenge of a large&#8208;scale application of methyltransferases is their dependence on S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a stoichiometric, and thus exceedingly expensive co&#8208;substrate. As a solution to this problem, we and others have explored the use of methyl halides as reagents for the in situ regeneration of SAM. However, the need to handle volatile electrophiles, such as methyl iodide (MeI), may also hamper applications at scale. As a more practical solution, we have now developed an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed process for the regeneration of SAM with methyl toluene sulfonate. Herein, we describe enzymes from the thiopurine methyltransferase family that accept sulfate&#8208; and sulfonate&#8208;based methyl donors to convert S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine into SAM with efficiencies that rival MeI&#8208;based reactions.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Directed Reversal of 13C NMR Chemical Shielding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the reversal of 13C NMR chemical shielding behavior of carbonyl carbon in sulfur and selenium substituted H&#8208;bonded amides. Solution phase NMR spectroscopy corroborated with various computational studies explains the physical origin of such unusual behavior.







Abstract
The deshielding or downfield 13C NMR chemical shift of amide carbonyl carbon upon H&#8208;bonding is a widely observed phenomenon. This downfield shift is commonly used as a spectroscopic ruler for H&#8208;bonding. However, the very first observation of an upfield 13C NMR of thiocarbonyl carbon in thioamides upon H&#8208;bonding encouraged us to explore the physical origin of the reversal of 13C NMR chemical shielding. Careful NMR analysis shows that sulfur and selenium&#8208;centered H&#8208;bonds (S/SeCHBs) induce a shielding effect on the 13CC=S(Se) while changing from amides to thioamides or selenoamides. In addition, natural chemical shielding (NCS) analysis shows that the &#963;11 and &#963;22 components of the isotropic shielding tensor (&#963;) have a crucial role in this unusual shielding.

We generated bench&#8208;top stable fluoro&#8208; and chloro&#8208;diborylmethanes and their application to the synthesis of tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes via the Boron&#8211;Wittig reaction is reported. To demonstrate their synthetic utility, the obtained (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes were transformed to fluoroalkene derivatives and all&#8208;carbon substituted alkenes.







Abstract
Reported herein is the efficient synthesis of tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes by the Boron&#8211;Wittig reaction of ketones and aldehydes with bench&#8208;top stable halo&#8208;diborylmethanes. The substrate scope is broad and the Boron&#8211;Wittig reaction proceeds from a diverse range of ketones and aldehydes including biologically relevant molecules with fluoro&#8208; or chloro&#8208;diborylmethanes, providing tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes in good yields with high stereoselectivity. The utilities of the obtained (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes are highlighted by further modifications to afford fluoroalkene derivatives or all&#8208;carbon substituted alkene.

         <dc:description>
Complexes formed between aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) acceptors and arylamine donors showed through&#8208;space charge transfer as well as a &#8220;twist+twist&#8221; interaction between the acceptor and the donor. Owing to these properties, the complexes served as far&#8208;red fluorescent nanoprobes with two&#8208;photon excitation. The probe was applied to in vivo imaging of the mouse cerebrovascular system.







Abstract
Much effort has been devoted to the generation of fluorescent probes by synthetic approaches. In this study, we developed a facile strategy to construct far&#8208;red fluorescent probes based on through&#8208;space charge transfer within complexes of acceptors and donors and their &#8220;twist+twist&#8221; interactions. Owing to their rare two&#8208;photon excitation property, the complexes could be used for in vivo imaging of the mouse cerebrovascular system.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Antimony&#8208;Rich Polyoxometalate with Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antitumor Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel soluble and water&#8208;stable giant Sb&#8208;rich polyoxometalate (POM) has been developed, which shows the largest Sb&#8722;Ln&#8722;W cluster and has the greatest number of Sb centers in a cluster yet found in POM chemistry. Importantly, the Sb&#8208;rich POM can exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antitumor and anti&#8208;metastatic activities in vitro and in vivo without causing adverse effects, making it a promising candidate for a antitumor agent.







Abstract
Herein, a giant Sb&#8208;rich polyoxometalate (POM) {Sb21Tb7W56} is reported, which contains the largest number of Sb atoms in a POM so far. The Sb&#8208;rich POM has many interesting structural features and is a rare example of a soluble and water&#8208;stable giant POM. Biomedical studies indicate that the Sb&#8208;rich POM exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum antitumor activity against various cancer cell lines by reactivating the P53&#8208;dependent apoptotic processes and disrupting the mitochondrial membrane. In addition, this Sb&#8208;rich POM was capable of suppressing the growth and metastasis of a breast cancer in vivo. This work demonstrates that Sb&#8208;rich POMs are promising candidates for the development of new anticancer drugs.

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Induced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials Based on Indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole with an Efficient Narrowband Pure&#8208;Green Electroluminescence</title>

         <dc:description>
Combining the multiple&#8208;resonance ability of the indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole unit with boron&#8208;nitrogen skeletons has led to compounds that show efficient green emission (CIE: 0.21, 0.71) and efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). OLEDs incorporating these multiple&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials show a pure narrowband green emission (CIE: 0.22, 0.71) and a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 32.2&#8201;%







Abstract
Herein, we report two multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters (VTCzBN and TCz&#8208;VTCzBN) based on indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole unit and boron&#8208;nitrogen skeletons, whose emissions peaking at 496 and 521&#8197;nm with full width at half maximum of 34 and 29&#8197;nm, respectively. Meanwhile, fast rate constants of reverse intersystem crossing of above 106&#8197;s&#8722;1 are obtained due to small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps and large spin&#8208;orbital coupling values. Notably, planar molecular structures along the transition dipole moment direction endow them with high horizontal emitting dipole ratios of up to 94&#8201;%. Consequently, the corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) show the maximum external quantum efficiencies of 31.7&#8201;% and 32.2&#8201;%, respectively. Particularly, OLED with TCz&#8208;VTCzBN display ultra&#8208;pure green emission with Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage coordinates of (0.22, 0.71), consistent with the green display standard of the National Television System Committee.

         <title>Single Atom Ru Monolithic Electrode for Efficient Chlorine Evolution and Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

We report an inherent oxide anchoring strategy to synthesize monolithic single atom electrodes. The prepared Ru single atom electrode exhibited exceptional electrochemical chlorine evolution and nitrate reduction performances. The scalability and bifunctionality of Ru single atom electrode highlight its great potential of electrochemical applications.







Abstract
Fabricating single&#8208;atom electrodes via atomic dispersion of active metal atoms into monolithic metal supports is of great significance to advancing the lab&#8208;to&#8208;fab translation of the electrochemical technologies. Here, we report an inherent oxide anchoring strategy to fasten ligand&#8208;free isolated Ru atoms on the amorphous layer of monolithic Ti support by regulating the electronic metal&#8208;support interactions. The prepared Ru single atom electrode exhibited exceptional electrochemical chlorine evolution activity, three orders of magnitude higher mass activity than that of commercial dimensionally stable anode, and also selectively reduced nitrate to ammonia with an unprecedented ammonia yield rate of 22.2&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V. Furthermore, the Ru single atom monolithic electrode can be scaled up from 2&#215;2&#8197;cm to 25&#215;15&#8197;cm at least, thus demonstrating great potential for industrial electrocatalytic applications.

         <title>Simultaneous and Spontaneous Oxidation and Reduction in Microdroplets by the Water Radical Cation/Anion Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous oxidation and reduction of phosphonate occur simultaneously in microdroplets. The key active species are the endogenous water radical cation and anion derived from water molecules and present at the droplet surface.







Abstract
Microdroplets show unique chemistry, especially in their intrinsic redox properties, and to this we here add a case of simultaneous and spontaneous oxidation and reduction. We report the concurrent conversions of several phosphonates to phosphonic acids by reduction (R&#8722;P &#8594; H&#8722;P) and to pentavalent phosphoric acids by oxidation. The experimental results suggest that the active reagent is the water radical cation/anion pair. The water radical cation is observed directly as the ionized water dimer while the water radical anion is only seen indirectly though the spontaneous reduction of carbon dioxide to formate. The coexistence of oxidative and reductive species in turn supports the proposal of a double&#8208;layer structure at the microdroplet surface, where the water radical cation and radical anion are separated and accumulated.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical Carboxylation of Organic Halides in the Presence of Catalytic Amounts of an Organomediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and metal&#8208;free method for the electroreductive carboxylation of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds has been developed to obtain carboxylated compounds in the presence of catalytic amounts of naphthalene as a mediator. This reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope, and is shown to be a powerful approach for the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of natural product and drug derivatives.







Abstract
Herein, an electroreductive carboxylation of organic carbon&#8208;halogen bonds (X=Br and Cl) promoted by catalytic amounts of naphthalene as an organic mediator is reported. This transformation proceeds smoothly under mild conditions with a broad substrate scope of 59 examples, affording the valuable and versatile carboxylic acids in moderate to excellent yields without the need of costly transition metal, wasted stoichiometric metal reductants, or sacrificial anodes. Further late&#8208;stage carboxylations of natural product and drug derivatives demonstrate its synthetic utility. Mechanistic studies confirmed the activation of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds via single&#8208;electron transfer and the key role of naphthalene in this reaction.

         <title>Static and Dynamic Gradient Based Directional Transportation of Neutral Molecules in Swollen Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral molecules are transported along a pre&#8208;defined pathway via static and dynamic chemical gradient respectively. A static hexyl to hydroxyl functionalized gradient could pull the neutral ambipolar nerve agent surrogate diethyl (cyanomethyl)phosphonate towards hydroxyl&#8208;rich region. A dynamic gradient (a &#8220;travelling wave&#8221;) formed by a coupled reaction&#8208;diffusion process was utilized to drive the neutral non&#8208;polar molecule pyrene.







Abstract
Materials which selectively transport molecules offer powerful opportunities for concentrating and separating chemical agents. Here, utilizing static and dynamic chemical gradients, transport of molecules within swollen crosslinked polymers is demonstrated. Using an &#8776;200&#8197;&#956;m static hydroxyl to hexyl gradient, the neutral ambipolar nerve agent surrogate diethyl (cyanomethyl)phosphonate (DECP) is directionally transported and concentrated 60&#8208;fold within 4&#8197;hours. To accelerate transport kinetics, a dynamic gradient (a &#8220;travelling wave&#8221;) is utilized. Here, the non&#8208;polar dye pyrene was transported. The dynamic gradient is generated by an ion exchange process triggered by the localized introduction of an aqueous NaCl solution, which converts the gel from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. As the hydrophilic region expands, associated water enters the gel, and pyrene is pushed ahead of the expansion front. The dynamic gradient provides about 10&#8208;fold faster transport kinetics than the static gradient.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Hydrogenation of Electron&#8208;Poor Alkenes and Dienes Enabled by a Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydride Addition/Protonolysis Mechanism

Rh(CO)2acac/xantphos in methanol catalyzes the selective mono&#8208;hydrogenation of electron&#8208;poor dienes and related substrates at low metal loadings via a hydride addition/Rh&#8208;enolate protonation pathway.







Abstract
The transition metal catalyzed hydrogenation of alkenes is a well&#8208;developed technology used on lab scale as well as on large scales in the chemical industry. Site&#8208; and chemoselective mono&#8208;hydrogenations of polarized conjugated dienes remain challenging. Instead, stoichiometric main&#8208;group hydrides are used rather than H2. As part of an effort to develop a scalable route to prepare geranylacetone, we discovered that Rh(CO)2acac/xantphos based catalysts enable the selective mono&#8208;hydrogenation of electron&#8208;poor 1,3&#8208;dienes, enones, and other polyunsaturated substrates. D&#8208;labeling and DFT studies support a mechanism where a nucleophilic RhI&#8208;hydride selectively adds to electron&#8208;poor alkenes and the resulting Rh&#8208;enolate undergoes subsequent inner&#8208;sphere protonation by alcohol solvent. The finding that (Ln)Rh(H)(CO) type catalysts can enable selective mono&#8208;hydrogenation of electron&#8208;poor 1,3&#8208;dienes provides a valuable tool in the design of related chemoselective hydrogenation processes.

         <title>Atropopeptides are a Novel Family of Ribosomally Synthesized and Posttranslationally Modified Peptides with a Complex Molecular Shape</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atropopeptides are a family of ribosomally synthesized and postranslationally modified peptides with an unusual complex molecular shape. A single cytochrome P450 is sufficient for the atropospecific introduction of one carbon&#8208;carbon and two carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds. A two&#8208;step maturation process yields hexa&#8208; and pentapeptide products that act as signaling metabolites and show proliferative and pro&#8208;migratory properties in endothelial cell cultures.







Abstract
Biomacromolecules are known to feature complex three&#8208;dimensional shapes that are essential for their function. Among natural products, ambiguous molecular shapes are a rare phenomenon. The hexapeptide tryptorubin A can adopt one of two unusual atropisomeric configurations. Initially hypothesized to be a non&#8208;ribosomal peptide, we show that tryptorubin A is the first characterized member of a new family of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) that we named atropopeptides. The sole modifying enzyme encoded in the gene cluster, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, is responsible for the atropospecific formation of one carbon&#8208;carbon and two carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds. The characterization of two additional atropopeptide biosynthetic pathways revealed a two&#8208;step maturation process. Atropopeptides promote pro&#8208;angiogenic cell functions as indicated by an increase in endothelial cell proliferation and undirected migration. Our study expands the biochemical space of RiPP&#8208;modifying enzymes and paves the way towards the chemoenzymatic utilization of atropopeptide&#8208;modifying P450s.

         <title>Fluorinated Copolypeptide&#8208;Stabilized Microbubbles with Maleimide&#8208;Decorated Surfaces as Long&#8208;Term Ultrasound Contrast Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic fluorinated copolypeptides are used to stabilize perfluorocarbon&#8208;filled microbubbles (MBs) with the formation of highly stable ultrasound (US) contrast agents. Moreover, the US signals can be remarkably enhanced by the in situ reaction of peripheral maleimide moieties with plasma proteins without compromising the stability of MBs, outperforming commercially available SonoVueTM MBs in in vivo US imaging applications.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;filled microbubbles (MBs) have been clinically used as ultrasound (US) contrast agents for disease diagnosis and treatment. However, it remains a great challenge to resolve the dilemma of stability and contrast enhancement of MBs. Herein, amphiphilic copolypeptides bearing fluorinated blocks are synthesized to stabilize perfluorocarbon (PFC)&#8208;filled MBs, exhibiting unique stability under both long&#8208;term storage and US imaging conditions. The fluorinated inner layer reduces the internal Laplace pressure and greatly improves the stability of MBs, which can be further reinforced by crosslinking of the dipropargyl&#8208;containing middle blocks. To overcome the suppressed nonlinear oscillation of polymer shells, maleimide groups are introduced onto the surface of MBs, enabling in situ reaction with plasma proteins to enhance second harmonic signals without compromising the stability of MBs, conferring better US imaging performance than that of SonoVueTM MBs.

         <title>Intermolecular Metal&#8208;Free Cyclopropanation and Aziridination of Alkenes with XH2 (X=N, C) by Thianthrenation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a general and practical protocol to aziridines and cyclopropanes using free XH2 (X=C or N) with alkenes by thianthrenation is presented under mild conditions. Free sulfonamides, amides, carbamates, amines, and acidic methylene with protons, are good precursors for three&#8208;membered ring formation, providing an attractive alternative for straightforward synthesis of aziridines and cyclopropanes from easily available starting materials.







Abstract
Three&#8208;membered cyclic structures are widely existing in natural products and serve as enabling intermediates in organic synthesis. However, the efficient and straightforward access to such structures with diversity remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a general and practical protocol to aziridines and cyclopropanes synthesis using free XH2 (X=C or N) with alkenes by thianthrenation is presented. This metal&#8208;free protocol features the direct aziridination and cyclopropanation with unprotected XH2. Free sulfonamides, amides, carbamates, amines, and methylene with acidic protons, are good precursors, providing an attractive alternative for straightforward synthesis of aziridines and cyclopropanes from easily available starting materials.

         <title>Less is More: A Shortcut for Anionocages Design Based on (RPO32&#8722;)&#8208;Monourea Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergent hydrogen bonding motif of phosphotyrosine residues of proteins has inspired an advanced strategy for the design of a new type of anionocage based on (RPO32&#8722;)&#8208;monourea coordination, which features more simple synthesis and more potential of functionalization than the former strategy based on (PO43&#8722;)&#8208;bisurea coordination, providing a proof of the design concept &#8220;Less is More&#8221;.







Abstract
Anionocages have been developed as a unique family of hydrogen bonded cages. However, strategies for constructing anionocages are mainly limited to that based on (PO43&#8722;)&#8208;bisurea coordination, neither the ligands nor the anions lack the simplicity and diversity of the maturely developed analogues based on metal coordination (i.e. metallocage). We report herein a more simple strategy for anionocages design based on (RPO32&#8722;)&#8208;monourea coordination, utilizing monourea rather than bisurea as the hydrogen binding donor, and RPO32&#8722; rather than PO43&#8722; as the acceptor. Two fluorescent, quadruple helicate anionocages were constructed by a bis&#8208;monourea ligand, and dianions PhOPO32&#8722; (H1) or HOPO32&#8722; (H1A), respectively, which were capable of encapsulating a series of cation guests. As revealed by molecular modeling, H1 features remarkable guest&#8208;adaptive cavity breathing without change of the quadruple helicate topology, which allowed the encapsulation of different sized guests in an &#8220;induced fit&#8221; manner.

         <title>SpeedMixing: Rapid Tribochemical Synthesis and Discovery of Pharmaceutical Cocrystals without Milling or Grinding Media
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of SpeedMixing, a rapid blending technology, for rapid and scalable synthesis and discovery of pharmaceutical cocrystals without using either bulk solvents or milling media is reported. SpeedMixing permits selective synthesis of cocrystal polymorphs, stoichiomorphs and revealed the first solvate of the archetypal pharmaceutical cocrystal of carbamazepine and saccharin, that has remained unknown despite 20&#8197;years of research and screening.







Abstract
We present SpeedMixing, a rapid blending technology, as an approach for fast mechanosynthesis and discovery of model pharmaceutical cocrystals through rapid spinning in the absence of bulk solvents and milling/grinding media. Syntheses of pharmaceutical cocrystals based on the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) carbamazepine, dihydrocarbamazepine, and nicotinamide demonstrate SpeedMixing as a method for rapid, scalable, as well as controllable and selective synthesis of cocrystals, cocrystal polymorphs and stoichiomorphs, including the discovery of an unexpected methanol solvate of the archetypal cocrystal of carbamazepine and saccharin, which has eluded extensive screens over 20&#8197;years.

         <title>Synthesis of Square Planar Cu4 Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polynuclear reaction sites catalyze some of the most challenging transformations in chemistry. Programmatic assembly of atomically&#8208;precise cluster compounds is challenging. Here we describe the synthesis of supramolecular ligands designed to nucleate well&#8208;defined square planar tetranuclear copper clusters, establishing metal&#8208;metal interactions capable of delocalizing oxidation stress across the cluster.







Abstract
Template&#8208;assisted synthesis of well&#8208;defined polynuclear clusters remains a challenge for [M4] square planar topologies. Herein, we present a tetraamine scaffold RL(NH2)4, where L is a rigidified resorcin[4]arene, to direct the formation of C4&#8208;symmetric RL(NH)4Cu4 clusters with Cu&#8722;Cu distances around 2.7&#8197;&#197;, suggesting metal&#8208;metal direct interactions are operative since the sum of copper's van der Waals radii is 2.8&#8197;&#197;. DFT calculations display HOMO to HOMO&#8208;3 residing all within a 0.1&#8197;eV gap. These four orbitals display significant electron density contribution from the Cu centers suggesting a delocalized electronic structure. The one&#8208;electron oxidized [Cu4]+ species was probed by variable temperature X&#8208;band continuous wave&#8208;electron paramagnetic resonance (CW&#8208;EPR), which displays a multiline spectrum at room temperature. This work presents a novel synthetic strategy for [M4] clusters and a new platform to investigate activation of small molecules.

         <title>Differential Peptide Multi&#8208;Macrocyclizations at the Surface of a Helical Foldamer Template</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective formation of different macrocycles can be implemented using Cys residues within a peptide and chloroacetamides at the surface of a foldamer helix by placing the latter at precise locations. Helix rigidity and faster formation of smaller macrocycles make the favored product largely predictable.







Abstract
Hybrid sequences comprising a peptide with several Cys residues and an aromatic foldamer helix with several chloroacetamide functions at its surface were synthesized. Such products may in principle form numerous macromulticyclic thioether products by intramolecularly combining all Cys residues and all chloroacetamide functions. However, we show that the reactive sites on the structurally defined helix can be placed at such locations that the peptide selectively stitches itself to form a series of different macrocycles within mostly one preferred product. Reactions were monitored by HPLC and products with two, three or four macrocycles were identified using LC&#8211;MS and NMR. The series of selective macrocyclizations define a sort of reaction trail where reaction sites otherwise identical are involved successively because of their precise positioning in space. The trails can be predicted to a large extent based on structural considerations and the assumption that smaller macrocycles form faster.

         <title>Regulating Surface Reaction Kinetics through Ligand Field Effects for Fast and Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The boron acid additive can alleviate the intrinsic tradeoff between Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and the interfacial hydrogen evolution reaction by modulating the solvation sheath. The formed solvation structure with moderate ligand field strength enables fast and highly reversible Zn deposition.







Abstract
Designing water&#8208;deficient solvation sheath of Zn2+ by ligand substitution is a widely used strategy to protect Zn metal anode, yet the intrinsic tradeoff between Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and the side hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a huge challenge. Herein, we find boric acid (BA) with moderate ligand field interaction can partially replace H2O molecules in the solvation sheath of Zn2+, forming a stable water&#8208;deficient solvation sheath. It enables fast Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and substantially suppressed HER. Crucially, by systematically comparing the ligand field strength and solvation energies between BA and the ever&#8208;reported electrolyte additives, we also find that the solvation energy has a strong correlation with Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and HER inhibition ability, displaying a classic volcano behavior. The modulation map could provide valuable insights for solvation sheath design of zinc batteries and beyond.

         <title>Big (Bio)Chemical Data Mining Using Chemometric Methods: A Need for Chemists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Big (Bio)Chemical Data Mining: Large and complex chemical data sets generated by modern analytical technologies have led to the so&#8208;called Big (Bio)Chemical Data era. These data sets can be produced using modern analytical instruments such as multi&#8208;dimensional chromatography, high&#8208;resolution and multi&#8208;dimensional spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging and DNA/RNA microarrays. Chemometric methods have shown potential to analyze BBCD especially in omics sciences and chemical toxicology/drug discovery.







Abstract
This Review summarizes how big (bio)chemical data (BBCD) can be analyzed with multivariate chemometric methods and highlights some of the important challenges faced by modern analytical researches. Here, the potential of chemometric methods to solve BBCD problems that are being encountered in chromatographic, spectroscopic and hyperspectral imaging measurements will be discussed, with an emphasis on their applications to omics sciences. In addition, insights and perspectives on how to address the analysis of BBCD are provided along with a discussion of the procedures necessary to obtain more reliable qualitative and quantitative results. In this Review, the importance of &#8220;big data&#8221; and of their relevance to (bio)chemistry are first discussed. Thereafter, analytical tools which can produce BBCD are presented as well as the theoretical background of chemometric methods and their limitations when they are applied to BBCD. Finally, the importance of chemometric methods for the analysis of BBCD in different chemical disciplines is highlighted with some examples. In this work, we have tried to cover many of the current applications of big data analysis in the (bio)chemistry field.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Excited Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Silyl&#8208;Radical&#8208;Mediated Direct Activation of Carbamoyl Chlorides To Access (Hetero)aryl Carbamides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoexcited nickel catalysis enabled silyl&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated activation of carbamoyl chlorides. This process provides an operationally simple and widely applicable amidation reaction of a plethora of aryl and hetero(aryl) halides. Mechanistic understanding suggests that the reaction involves an energy&#8208;transfer mechanism for aryl bromide; while a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism is operating for aryl chlorides.







Abstract
Amide bonds connect the amino acids in proteins and exist as a prevalent structural motif in biomolecules. Herein, we have exploited the concept of cross&#8208;electrophile coupling by merging the photo&#8208;redox and transition&#8208;metal catalysis to construct carbamides from superabundant (hetero)aryl halides along with commercially feasible carbamoyl chlorides. The success of this method relies on the prior formation of NiII&#8208;aryl halide intermediates, which involves in a photoexcited Ni&#8208;halide homolysis event by energy transfer from aryl bromide and single&#8208;electron transfer from aryl chloride to assist generation of the vital carbamoyl radical. The breadth of application of this technique is demonstrated both in inter&#8208; as well as intramolecular routes for the synthesis of a plethora of (hetero)aryl carbamides with diverse functionalities, and biologically important benzolactams.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective 1,2&#8208;Oxyhalogenation of Non&#8208;Conjugated Alkynes via Directed Nucleopalladation: Catalytic Access to Tetrasubstituted Alkenes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereoselective oxyhalogenation of unactivated internal alkynes is facilitated by a structurally tuned bidentate directing auxiliary, providing rapid access to tetrasubstitued alkenes that can be further diversified into valuable products.







Abstract
A catalytic 1,2&#8208;oxyhalogenation method that converts non&#8208;conjugated internal alkynes into tetrasubstituted alkenes with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity is described. Mechanistically, the reaction involves a PdII/PdIV catalytic cycle that begins with a directed oxypalladation step. The origin of regioselectivity is the preference for formation of a six&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate, which is facilitated by an N,N&#8208;bidentate 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)isopropyl (PIP) amide directing group. Selectivity for C(alkenyl)&#8722;X versus &#8722;N (X=halide) reductive elimination from the PdIV center depends on the identity of the halide anion; bromide and iodide engage in C(alkenyl)&#8722;X formation, while intramolecular C(alkenyl)&#8722;N reductive elimination occurs with chloride to furnish a lactam product. DFT calculations shed light on the origins of this phenomenon.

         <dc:description>
[Bi(AAZTA)]&#8722; and derivatives have been comprehensively characterized. Fast formation, remarkable stability, strong accumulation in AR42J tumour make 213Bi(AAZTA&#8208;C4&#8208;TATE)]&#8722; an outstanding candidate for TAT.







Abstract
Targeted &#945; therapy (TAT) is a promising tool in the therapy of cancer.

An unexpected increase in the stability and kinetic inertness of the metal chelate was observed for the bifunctional derivative and was maintained for the peptide conjugate. A cyclotron&#8208;produced 205/206Bi mixture was used as a model of 213Bi in labelling, stability, and biodistribution experiments, allowing the efficiency of [213Bi(AAZTA&#8208;C4&#8208;TATE)]&#8722; to be estimated. High accumulation in AR42J tumours and reduced kidney uptake were observed with respect to the macrocyclic chelate [213Bi(DOTA&#8208;TATE)]&#8722;.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing and Shape Memory Hypercrosslinked Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra Polymers via Coordination Post&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of coordination hypercrosslinked MOP (CHMOP) polymers was prepared using soluble and well&#8208;defined MOPs as high&#8208;connectivity building blocks. The introduction of MOPs constructs a coordination dynamic network that not only enhances mechanical properties but also realizes multifunctionality including self&#8208;healing, shape memory, solution processability, and 3D printing. CHMOPs provide a novel platform for expansion of the smart soft materials.







Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven crosslinking networks with reversible and dynamic characteristics are gaining increasing interest in diverse application fields. Herein, we use a coordination crosslinking approach using metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as high&#8208;connectivity building blocks to post&#8208;assemble a class of coordination hypercrosslinked MOP (CHMOP) polymers. The introduction of 12&#8208;connected MOP nodes to the polymeric networks is critical to producing membranes that overcome the trade&#8208;off between mechanical properties and dynamic healing, and meanwhile possess multifunctionalities including shape memory, solution processability, and 3D printing. The CHMOPs can also be used for anticorrosion coating and achieve function couplings, e.g., shape memory&#8208;assisted self&#8208;healing (SMASH), which have not been achieved in the MOP&#8208;based hybrid materials yet. This work not only offers a feasible strategy to construct new multifunctional materials but also greatly expands the application scopes of MOPs.

         <title>Substrate Tumbling in a Chemisorbed Diastereomeric &#945;&#8208;Ketoester/1&#8208;(1&#8208;Naphthyl)ethylamine Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and adsorption forces, an &#945;&#8208;ketoester tumbles between two prochiral states in a chemisorbed diastereomeric complex.







Abstract
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) data for &#945;&#8208;ketoester/1&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthyl)ethylamine complexes on Pt(111) reveal a tumbling motion that couples two neighboring binding states. The interconversion, resulting in prochiral inversion of the &#945;&#8208;ketoester, occurs in single complexes without breaking them apart. This is a surprising observation because the overall motion requires rotation of the &#945;&#8208;ketoester away from the surface without branching exclusively into diffusion away from the complex or desorption. The multi&#8208;step interconversion is rationalized in terms of sequences of bound states that combine transient H&#8208;bond interactions with the chiral molecule and weakened adsorption interactions with the metal. The observation of tumbling in single long&#8208;lived complexes is of relevance to self&#8208;assembly and directed molecular motion on surfaces, to ligand&#8208;controlled surface reactions, and most directly to stereocontrol in asymmetric heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Conservation of Nickel Ion Single&#8208;Active Site Character in a Bottom&#8208;Up Constructed &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecular Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;surface synthesis of covalent nickel tetraphenylporphyrin network on Au(111) is studied by a multitechnique approach combining local microscopic insights with space&#8208;averaging synchrotron radiation&#8208;based methods. Even though the porphyrin nanomesh is not perfectly ordered extending the &#960;&#8208;system results in the appearance of energy&#8208;dispersive electronic features while the Ni cores remain in the characteristic single&#8208;molecule configuration.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface chemistry holds the potential for ultimate miniaturization of functional devices. Porphyrins are promising building&#8208;blocks in exploring advanced nanoarchitecture concepts. More stable molecular materials of practical interest with improved charge transfer properties can be achieved by covalently interconnecting molecular units. On&#8208;surface synthesis allows to construct extended covalent nanostructures at interfaces not conventionally available. Here, we address the synthesis and properties of covalent molecular network composed of interconnected constituents derived from halogenated nickel tetraphenylporphyrin on Au(111). We report that the &#960;&#8208;extended two&#8208;dimensional material exhibits dispersive electronic features. Concomitantly, the functional Ni cores retain the same single&#8208;active site character of their single&#8208;molecule counterparts. This opens new pathways when exploiting the high robustness of transition metal cores provided by bottom&#8208;up constructed covalent nanomeshes.

         <title>Conferring BiVO4 Nanorods with Oxygen Vacancies to Realize Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoetching can confer BiVO4 with oxygen vacancies and enhance the catalytic performance of BiVO4. The photoetched BiVO4 can catalyze water splitting to generate oxygen and hydroxyl radicals under the mediation of ultrasound. The generated oxygen can relieve tumor hypoxia, thereby improving the sonodynamic cancer therapy performance of BiVO4.







Abstract
Owing to the high depth of tissue penetration, non&#8208;invasiveness, and controllability, ultrasound (US)&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has shown broad application prospects for tumor treatment. However, the electron&#8208;hole separation inefficiency of sonosensitizers and the tumor hypoxia remain two major challenges limiting the effect of SDT. Here, ultrafine photoetched bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) nanorods modified with DSPE&#8208;PEG2000 (PEBVO@PEG NRs) were fabricated to achieve in situ self&#8208;supply of oxygen (O2) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) for hypoxic tumor therapy. The photoetching approach could enhance the charge separation by inducing enriched oxygen vacancies on the surface of BiVO4, thereby improving the generation efficiency of ROS and O2. The PEBVO@PEG overcome the main obstacles of traditional sonosensitizers in the SDT process and show promising sonodynamic therapeutic effects, thus providing new strategies for improving the performance of sonosensitizer and hypoxic tumor elimination.
