         <title>Conjugated Covalent Template Strategy for All&#8208;Benzene Catenane Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically interlocked molecules based on oligoparaphenylene&#8208;derived nanohoops, particularly those without heteroatoms, are synthetically challenging and topologically intriguing targets. Herein, a &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent template strategy based on azo group has been developed, which features dual intramolecular macrocyclizations directed by a tetra&#8208;substituted azobenzene core, followed by traceless removal of the azo linker. Employing this strategy, the efficient synthesis of a novel all&#8208;benzene [2]catenane consisting of meta&#8208;cycloparaphenylenes has been accomplished.</dc:description>

         <title>Unblocking Ion&#8208;occluded Pore Channels in Poly(triazine imide) Framework for Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(triazine imide) or PTI is an ordered graphitic carbon nitride hosting &#197;&#8208;scale pores attractive for selective molecular transport. AA&#8217;&#8208;stacked PTI layers are synthesized by ionothermal route during which ions occupy the framework and occlude the pores. Synthesis of ion&#8208;free PTI hosting AB&#8208;stacked layers has been reported, however, pores in this configuration are blocked by the neighboring layer. The unavailability of open pore limits application of PTI in molecular transport. Herein, we demonstrate acid treatment for ion depletion which maintains AA&#8217; stacking and results in open pore structure. We provide first direct evidence of ion&#8208;depleted open pores by imaging with the atomic resolution using integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy. Depending on the extent of ion&#8208;exchange, AA&#8217; stacking with open channels and AB stacking with closed channels are obtained and imaged for the first time. The accessibility of open channels is demonstrated by enhanced proton transport through ion depleted PTI.</dc:description>

         <title>In vivo Realization of Combined Photodynamic and Photothermal Therapy for Melanoma by Mitochondria Targeting Dinuclear Ruthenium Complexes under Civil Infrared Low&#8208;power Laser</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of dinuclear Ru(II) complexes with extremely high TPA cross sections in the range of 800&#8722;900 nm have been designed. The amphiphilic complex  Ru3  containing tert&#8208;butyl groups has balanced performance in singlet oxygen generation and photothermal conversion and becomes the ideal drug candidate of the series.  Ru3  targets mitochondria without penetrating the nucleus, which substantially increases its photodynamic therapy activity and reduces its dark cytotoxicity.  Ru3  successfully suppresses melanoma tumor growth in vitro and in vivo with combined photodynamic and photothermal therapy under low light dose irradiation of an 808 nm low&#8208;power laser, avoiding the known PDT resistance in melanoma. The excellent therapeutic effect of  Ru3  facilitates its applications in further human trials for larger or deeper buried tumors, thereby becoming a prospective candidate for a new generation of low&#8208;power IR&#8208;driven dual PDT/PTT drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Persistent Polarization Change in a Spin Transition Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using light as a local heat source to induce a temporary pyroelectric current is widely recognized as an effective way to control the polarization of crystalline materials. In contrast, harnessing light directly to modulate the polarization of a crystal via excitation of the electronic bands remains less explored. In this study, we report an Fe(II) spin crossover crystal that exhibits photoinduced macroscopic polarization change upon excitation by green light. When the excited crystal relaxes to the ground state, the corresponding pyroelectric current can be detected. An analysis of the structures, magnetic properties and the M&#246;ssbauer and infrared spectra of the complex, supported by calculations, revealed that the polarization change is dictated by the directional relative movement of ions during the spin transition process. The spin transition and polarization change occur simultaneously in response to light stimulus, which demonstrates the enormous potential of polar spin crossover systems in the field of optoelectronic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Alkylsulfenylation with a Disulfide Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of alkylthio electrophiles in synthesis remains elusive by the lack of access to a suitable reagent that is practical and of excellent enantioselectivity and appropriate reactivity. In this work we introduce a novel alkylthio reagent based on the 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (MMTD) fragment for direct alkylsulfenylation of ketones and aldehydes. It can be readily prepared from oxidative coupling between thiadiazole and other alkylthiols and merge with chiral primary aminocatalysis successfully. This protocol provides facile access for the construction of diverse &#945;&#8208;alkylthio quaternary carbon with good stereoselectivities.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, an efficient and facile approach to valuable  &#946;  &#8208;hydroxy acid derivatives from readily available aryl epoxides and CO  2  with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity under mild and sustainable electrochemical conditions is described. This approach showed broad substrate scope and good functional&#8208;group compatibility. In addition to aryl epoxides, four&#8208; to six&#8208;membered aryl cyclic ethers could all be tolerated in the reaction to provide synthetically useful hydroxy acids with high efficiency. Further late&#8208;stage carboxylation of complex molecules and drug derivatives demonstrated its potential application in the pharmaceutical industry. Mechanistic studies disclosed possible reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanoresponsive Carbamoyloximes for the Activation of Secondary Amines in Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanophores are molecular moieties that are incorporated into polymers and respond to force with constitutional, configurational, or conformational bond rearrangements to enable functionality. Up to today, several chemically latent motifs have been activated by polymer mechanochemical methods, but the generation of secondary amines remains elusive. Here we report carbamoyloximes as mechanochemical protecting groups for secondary amines. We show that carbamoyloximes undergo force&#8208;induced homolytic bond scission at the N&#8208;O oxime bond in polymers thus producing the free amine, as the reaction proceeds via the carbamoyloxyl and aminyl radicals, analogously to its photochemical counterpart. Eventually, we apply the carbamoyloxime motif in a force&#8208;activated organocatalytic Knoevenagel reaction. We believe that this protecting strategy can be universally applied for many other secondary and primary amines in polymer materials.</dc:description>

Here we report carbamoyloximes as mechanochemical protecting groups for secondary amines. We show that carbamoyloximes undergo force-induced homolytic bond scission at the N-O oxime bond in polymers thus producing the free amine, as the reaction proceeds via the carbamoyloxyl and aminyl radicals, analogously to its photochemical counterpart. Eventually, we apply the carbamoyloxime motif in a force-activated organocatalytic Knoevenagel reaction. We believe that this protecting strategy can be universally applied for many other secondary and primary amines in polymer materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Optically Anisotropic Crystal with Large Birefringence Arising from Cooperative &#960; Orbitals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent materials are highly demanded for high&#8208;performance polarized optics. As compared with artificial anisotropic metamaterials, anisotropic crystals have advantages of low optical losses and easy processing, but their birefringence is still limited. Herein, based on first&#8208;principles studies, we identified a new type of functional anion units, (HxC6N9)(3&#8208;x)&#8208; (x = 0, 1, 2), and then successfully synthesized a new anisotropic crystal, namely, CsH2C6N9&#183;H2O (I), whose crystal structure consists of (H2C6N9)&#8208; anions. Remarkably, I is ultraviolet&#160;transparent and exhibits very large birefringence of about 0.55@550 nm, which is much larger than those of commercial birefringent crystals. These results make I a candidate for highly efficient manipulation of optics and light in optical modulation devices. Theoretical calculations reveal that large birefringence mainly arises from the cooperative &#960; orbitals in (H2C6N9)&#8208; anions. This work provides a new insight on the underlying structure&#8208;property relationships of anisotropic crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation Induced Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence Duality in Tetracationic Binaphthyl&#8208;Based Cyclophanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report an approach to the synthesis of highly charged enantiopure cyclophanes by the insertion of axially chiral enantiomeric binaphthyl fluorophores into the constitutions of pyridinium&#8208;based macrocycles. Remarkably, these fluorescent tetracationic cyclophanes exhibit a significant AIE compared to their neutral optically active binaphthyl precursors. A combination of theoretical calculations and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy reveal that the AIE originates from limited torsional vibrations associated with the axes of chirality present in the chiral enantiomeric binaphthyl units and the fine&#8208;tuning of their electronic landscape when incorporated within the cyclophane structure. Furthermore, these highly charged enantiopure cyclophanes display CPL responses both in solution and in the aggregated state. This unique duality of AIE and CPL in these tetracationic cyclophanes is destined to be of major importance in future development of photonic devices and bio&#8208;applications.</dc:description>

         <title>H2O2&#8208;Responsive NIR&#8208;II AIE Nanobomb for Carbon Monoxide Boosting Low&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The upregulated expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) impairs the therapeutic efficacy of photothermal therapy (PTT). Inhibition of HSPs repair is crucial for improving the efficiency of low&#8208;temperature PTT. The AIE nanobomb PBPTV@mPEG(CO) could be triggered by the over&#8208;expressed hydrogen peroxide in the tumor microenvironment and release CO to inhibit the upregulated expression of HSPs during low&#8208;temperature PTT to enhance the antitumor efficiency.







Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy (PTT), which circumvents the limitations of conventional PTT (e.g., thermotolerance and adverse effects), is an emerging therapeutic strategy which shows great potential for future clinical applications. The expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) can dramatically impair the therapeutic efficacy of PTT. Thus, inhibition of HSPs repair and reducing the damage of nearby normal cells is crucial for improving the efficiency of low&#8208;temperature PTT. Herein, we developed a nanobomb based on the self&#8208;assembly of NIRII AIE polymer PBPTV and carbon monoxide (CO) carrier polymer mPEG(CO). This smart nanobomb can be exploded in a tumor microenvironment in which hydrogen peroxide is overexpressed and release CO into cancer cells to significantly inhibit the expression of HSPs and hence improve the antitumor efficiency of the low&#8208;temperature PTT.

         <title>Sulfur&#8211;Phenolate Exchange: SuFEx&#8208;Derived Dynamic Covalent Reactions and Degradation of SuFEx Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfur(VI)&#8211;phenolate exchange (SuPhenEx) reaction between sulfonimidates and phenols has been shown to generate new sulfonimidates that undergo dynamic covalent reactions with other phenols. The fast, high&#8208;yielding, and enantiospecific reactions are useful for both asymmetric synthesis and the degradation of SuFEx polymers. The wide scope of the reaction extends the usefulness of SuFEx and related click reactions.







Abstract
The products of the SuFEx reaction between sulfonimidoyl fluorides and phenols, sulfonimidates, are shown to display dynamic covalent chemistry with other phenols. This reaction was shown to be enantiospecific, finished in minutes at room temperature in high yields, and useful for both asymmetric synthesis and sustainable polymer production. Its wide scope further extends the usefulness of SuFEx and related click chemistries.

         <title>Third&#8208;Generation Covalent TMP&#8208;Tag for Fast Labeling and Multiplexed Imaging of Cellular Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The third&#8208;generation TMP&#8208;tag3 is developed. It features optimized synthesis, fluorogenic labeling, and fast cellular intake. It performs well in comparative studies with HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;tag. The 18&#8197;kD&#8208;protein tag is compatible with loop insertion. The TMP&#8208;tag3 supplements and supplants the existing self&#8208;labeling protein tags, adding an orthogonal channel for multiplexed labeling and nanoscopic imaging.







Abstract
Self&#8208;labeling protein tags can introduce advanced molecular motifs to specific cellular proteins. Here we introduce the third&#8208;generation covalent TMP&#8208;tag (TMP&#8208;tag3) and showcase its comparison with HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;tag. TMP&#8208;tag3 is based on a proximity&#8208;induced covalent Michael addition between an engineered Cys of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) and optimized trimethoprim (TMP)&#8211;acrylamide conjugates with minimal linkers. Compared to previous versions, the TMP&#8208;tag3 features an enhanced permeability when conjugated to fluorogenic spirocyclic rhodamines. As a small protein, the 18&#8208;kD eDHFR is advantageous in tagging selected mitochondrial proteins which are less compatible with bulkier HaloTag fusions. The proximal N&#8722;C termini of eDHFR also enable facile insertion into various protein loops. TMP&#8208;tag3, HaloTag, and SNAP&#8208;tag are orthogonal to each other, collectively forming a toolbox for multiplexed live&#8208;cell imaging of cellular proteins under fluorescence nanoscopy.

     alt="Third-Generation Covalent TMP-Tag for Fast Labeling and Multiplexed Imaging of Cellular Proteins"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third-generation TMP-tag3 is developed. It features optimized synthesis, fluorogenic labeling, and fast cellular intake. It performs well in comparative studies with HaloTag and SNAP-tag. The 18&#8197;kD-protein tag is compatible with loop insertion. The TMP-tag3 supplements and supplants the existing self-labeling protein tags, adding an orthogonal channel for multiplexed labeling and nanoscopic imaging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-labeling protein tags can introduce advanced molecular motifs to specific cellular proteins. Here we introduce the third-generation covalent TMP-tag (TMP-tag3) and showcase its comparison with HaloTag and SNAP-tag. TMP-tag3 is based on a proximity-induced covalent Michael addition between an engineered Cys of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) and optimized trimethoprim (TMP)&#8211;acrylamide conjugates with minimal linkers. Compared to previous versions, the TMP-tag3 features an enhanced permeability when conjugated to fluorogenic spirocyclic rhodamines. As a small protein, the 18-kD eDHFR is advantageous in tagging selected mitochondrial proteins which are less compatible with bulkier HaloTag fusions. The proximal N&#8722;C termini of eDHFR also enable facile insertion into various protein loops. TMP-tag3, HaloTag, and SNAP-tag are orthogonal to each other, collectively forming a toolbox for multiplexed live-cell imaging of cellular proteins under fluorescence nanoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Three&#8208;Dimensional Inorganic Analogue of 9,10&#8208;Diazido&#8208;9,10&#8208;Diboraanthracene: A Lewis Superacidic Azido Borane with Reactivity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D analogue of 9,10&#8208;diazido&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydrodiboraanthracene exists as a monomer in both the solid and solution state. It is thermally stable up to 230&#8201;&#176;C, representing a rare example of an azido borane with boosted Lewis acidity and stability in one. Apart from the classical acid&#8208;base and Staudinger reactions, it is capable of E&#8722;H bond activation (E=B, Si, Ge).







Abstract
Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) inorganic analogue of 9,10&#8208;diazido&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydrodiboraantracene, which turned out to be a monomer in both the solid and solution state, and thermally stable up to 230&#8201;&#176;C, representing a rare example of azido borane with boosted Lewis acidity and stability in one. Apart from the classical acid&#8208;base and Staudinger reactions, E&#8722;H bond activation (E=B, Si, Ge) was investigated. While the reaction with B&#8722;H (9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) led directly to the 1,1&#8208;addition on N&#945; upon N2 elimination, the Si&#8722;H (Et3SiH, PhMe2SiH) activation proceeded stepwise via 1,2&#8208;addition, with the key intermediates 5int and 6int being isolated and characterized. In contrast, the cooperative Ge&#8722;H was reversible and stayed at the 1,2&#8208;addition step.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Adaptive Chiral [1]Rotaxane for Thermo&#8208;Rulable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of covalently &#8220;potting&#8221; an emitter into a flexible chiral macrocycle was proposed to achieve steerable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activities in solid state. The concept benefits from the adaptive confinement of the emitter in the nanocavity of the self&#8208;assembled nanoarchitectures.







Abstract
It remains a formidable challenge to realize thermo&#8208;rulable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, we propose a new strategy by covalently &#8220;potting&#8221; the emitter into a flexible chiral macrocycle as an adaptive chiral [1]rotaxane to address this issue. Different from its included analogue, the potted emitter [DS] showed adaptive conformers with tunable CPL in varied solvents. Significantly, upon controlled self&#8208;assembly, [DS] formed a channel&#8208;type nanoarchitecture ([DS]A), which exhibited an extraordinary thermo&#8208;rulable CPL between 25&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C. Impressively, the glum was large as 0.024 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, which was amplified to 0.040 at 90&#8201;&#176;C with a decrease of QY (from 92&#8201;% to 80&#8201;%). By comparison, the assemblies of cage&#8208;type [DS]B and the unpotted emitter showed irreversible or unanswered thermal behaviors. The work demonstrated the thermo&#8208;rulable and durable CPL for the first time and provided an insightful understanding of thermal effect on high&#8208;temperature and switchable CPL materials.

         <title>Hydrogen Tunneling in Catalytic Hydrolysis and Alcoholysis of Silanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;giant&#8221; kinetic isotope effect (KIE=346) has been observed for the generation of hydrogen from the hydrolysis of silanes catalyzed by a silyl&#8208;iridium(III) complex. This and other experimental evidence together with theoretical calculations have been used to demonstrate the participation of hydrogen quantum tunneling in this catalytic process.







Abstract
An unprecedented quantum tunneling effect has been observed in catalytic Si&#8722;H bond activations at room temperature. The cationic hydrido&#8208;silyl&#8208;iridium(III) complex, {Ir[SiMe(o&#8208;C6H4SMe)2](H)(PPh3)(THF)}[BArF4], has proven to be a highly efficient catalyst for the hydrolysis and the alcoholysis of organosilanes. When triethylsilane was used as a substrate, the system revealed the largest kinetic isotopic effect (KIESi&#8722;H/Si&#8722;D=346&#177;4) ever reported for this type of reaction. This unexpectedly high KIE, measured at room temperature, together with the calculated Arrhenius preexponential factor ratio (AH/AD=0.0004) and difference in the observed activation energy [(E
&#8722;E
)=34.07&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1] are consistent with the participation of quantum tunneling in the catalytic process. DFT calculations have been used to unravel the reaction pathway and identify the rate&#8208;determining step. Aditionally, isotopic effects were considered by different methods, and tunneling effects have been calculated to be crucial in the process.

         <title>Highly Regioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective hydroboration of unsymmetrical internal alkynes featuring with unique regioselecitivty, broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility was realized by using cobalt catalysts modified with newly developed cyclopropane&#8208;based diphosphine ligands. The current protocol enabled the synthesis of novel alkenyl borates and improved the synthetic efficiency of bioactive compounds.







Abstract
Herein, we report the development of new Co complexes that have cyclopropane&#8208;based diphosphine ligands and can catalyze highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective hydroboration reactions of unsymmetrical internal alkynes. These reactions exhibited unusual regioselectivity: specifically, reactions of aryl alkyl internal alkynes showed excellent cis&#8208;&#946;&#8208;addition selectivity, and reactions of dialkyl internal alkynes gave excellent cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;addition selectivity. Highly regioselective hydroboration of unsymmetrical dialkyl internal alkynes cannot be achieved by other known methods. The reactions described herein are highly synthetically useful, particularly for the stereoselective synthesis of trisubstituted alkenylborates and alkenes. Mechanistic studies indicate that a CoI&#8722;H species is a plausible active catalyst and the rigid structure of the cyclopropane skeleton of the ligands and the crowded reaction pocket were responsible for the unprecedented regioselectivity.

         <title>A Mechanochemical, Catalyst&#8208;Free Cascade Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Diols and 1,4&#8208;Iodoalcohols Using Styrenes and Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient mechanochemical electrophilic functionalization reactions of unsaturated compounds with hypervalent iodine reagents have been developed. These green and sustainable mechanochemical protocols enable the synthesis of 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;difunctionalized molecules that are otherwise difficult to achieve via standard solution&#8208;phase methods. Our mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds in an intermolecular fashion.







Abstract
A mechanochemical and solvent/catalyst&#8208;free functionalization of olefins with hypervalent iodine reagents has been developed, enabling the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;dioxygenated compounds. Under similar reaction conditions with the addition of molecular iodine, 1,4&#8208;iodoalcohols can be synthesized. These valuable products are non&#8208;trivial to achieve via standard solution&#8208;phase methods. Mechanistic study reveals that the hypervalent iodine reagent might dimerize at solid state with the help of mechanical force. The active monomeric form of hypervalent iodine reagent might trigger the 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization reactions in an intermolecular cascade manner.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Pentacoordinated&#8208;Zirconium Catalyst with Axial Oxygen Ligand for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Zr&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalyst with a stable pentacoordinated structure and high single&#8208;atom Zr loading is discovered. With the high&#8208;loading catalyst, the assembled zinc&#8211;air battery delivers a record&#8208;high power density among those of single&#8208;atom catalyst&#8208;based zinc&#8211;air batteries.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), as promising alternatives to Pt&#8208;based catalysts, suffer from the limited choice of center metals and low single&#8208;atom loading. Here, we report a pentacoordinated Zr&#8208;based SAC with nontrivial axial O ligands (denoted O&#8722;Zr&#8722;N&#8722;C) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The O ligand downshifts the d&#8208;band center of Zr and confers Zr sites with stable local structure and proper adsorption capability for intermediates. Consequently, the ORR performance of O&#8722;Zr&#8722;N&#8722;C prominently surpasses that of commercial Pt/C, achieving a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode and outstanding durability (92&#8201;% current retention after 130&#8208;hour operation). Moreover, the Zr site shows good resistance towards aggregation, enabling the synthesis of Zr&#8208;based SAC with high loading (9.1&#8197;wt%). With the high&#8208;loading catalyst, the zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) delivers a record&#8208;high power density of 324&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 among those of SAC&#8208;based ZABs.

         <title>Small&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Additives Modulate Calcification by Interacting with Prenucleation Clusters on the Molecular Level
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small but effective: only few small additives are potent antiscalants, extremely solubilizing CaCO3. These underlying molecular mechanisms act beyond standard concepts of nucleation inhibition: they trigger, stabilize, and feed PNCs, presetting key properties of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC). This study reveals how small molecules may co&#8208;regulate biomineralization and breaks grounds for sustainable antiscalants.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (MW) additives can strongly impact amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), playing an elusive role in biogenic, geologic, and industrial calcification. Here, we present molecular mechanisms by which these additives regulate stability and composition of both CaCO3 solutions and solid ACC. Potent antiscalants inhibit ACC precipitation by interacting with prenucleation clusters (PNCs); they specifically trigger and integrate into PNCs or feed PNC growth actively. Only PNC&#8208;interacting additives are traceable in ACC, considerably stabilizing it against crystallization. The selective incorporation of potent additives in PNCs is a reliable chemical label that provides conclusive chemical evidence that ACC is a molecular PNC&#8208;derived precipitate. Our results reveal additive&#8208;cluster interactions beyond established mechanistic conceptions. They reassess the role of small&#8208;MW molecules in crystallization and biomineralization while breaking grounds for new sustainable antiscalants.

         <title>Chirality Induction on a Coordination Capsule for Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By utilizing a confined space inside a coordination capsule consisting of achiral components, we achieve trimeric structures composed of acetic acid and 2,3&#8208;disubstituted tartaric acid derivatives. Steric and electronic interactions between the substituents on the tartaric acid and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl arms of the capsule permit the transfer of the chirality of the tartaric acid to the capsule, resulting in diastereoenrichment of the host&#8211;guest complexes of up to 92 de%. The chiral templates can be washed away with diethyl ether, leaving an enantiomerically enriched capsule. The resulting capsule biases the dynamic axial chirality of a 4,4&#8217;&#8208;diacetoxybiphenyl guest carrying benzothiadiazole units, demonstrating guest&#8208;to&#8208;capsule and capsule&#8208;to&#8208;guest chirality transfer. The induced chirality on the bound guest enables it to emit circularly polarized luminescence in the NIR region, demonstrating the application of induced chirality for confined spaces for the generation of chiroptical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure of a promiscuous thioesterase domain responsible for branching acylation in polyketide biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioesterases (TEs) are fundamentally important enzymes present in all bacteria and eukaryotes, where they have conserved functions in fatty acid biosynthesis and secondary metabolism. This work provides the first structural insights into a functionally distinct group of TEs that perform diverse acylations in polyketide and peptide biosynthesis (TE  B  s). Structural analysis of the oocydin (OocS) TE  B  domain facilitated identification and engineering of the active site to modulate acyl&#8208;group acceptance. In this way, we achieved higher reactivity using a structure&#8208;based approach, building a foundation for biocatalytic development of TE  B  &#8208;mediated  O  &#8208;acylation, a modification known to improve the bioactivity of oocydin&#8208;type polyketides. Lastly, the promiscuity of the OocS TE  B  motivated us to investigate, and ultimately provide evidence for, the production of longer chain branched oocydins in the native host  Serratia plymuthica  4Rx13. This work frames the OocS TE  B  and homologs as invaluable synthetic biology tools for polyketide drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>sp&#8208;Carbon Incorporated Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as Photocathode for Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted increasing interest for broad applications in catalysis and gas separation due to their high porosity. However, the insulating feature and the limited active sites hindered MOFs as photocathode active materials for application in photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen generation. Herein, we develop a layered conductive two&#8208;dimensional conjugated MOF (2D c&#8208;MOF) comprising sp&#8208;carbon active sites based on arylene&#8208;ethynylene macrocycle ligand via CuO4 linking, named as Cu3HHAE2. This sp&#8208;carbon 2D c&#8208;MOF displays apparent semiconducting behavior and broad light absorption till the near&#8208;infrared band (1600 nm). Due to the abundant acetylene units, the Cu3HHAE2 could act as the first case of MOF photocathode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation and presents a record hydrogen&#8208;evolution photocurrent density of ~260 mA cm&#8208;2 at 0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode among the structurally&#8208;defined cocatalyst&#8208;free organic photocathodes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted increasing interest for broad applications in catalysis and gas separation due to their high porosity. However, the insulating feature and the limited active sites hindered MOFs as photocathode active materials for application in photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen generation. Herein, we develop a layered conductive two-dimensional conjugated MOF (2D c-MOF) comprising sp-carbon active sites based on arylene-ethynylene macrocycle ligand via CuO4 linking, named as Cu3HHAE2. This sp-carbon 2D c-MOF displays apparent semiconducting behavior and broad light absorption till the near-infrared band (1600 nm). Due to the abundant acetylene units, the Cu3HHAE2 could act as the first case of MOF photocathode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation and presents a record hydrogen-evolution photocurrent density of ~260 mA cm-2 at 0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode among the structurally-defined cocatalyst-free organic photocathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of the First Selective Nanomolar Inhibitors of Endoplasmic Reticulum Aminopeptidase 2 by Kinetic Target&#8208;Guided Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2) is a key enzyme involved in the trimming of antigenic peptides presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex class I. It is a target of growing interest for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and in cancer immunotherapy. However, the discovery of potent and selective ERAP2 inhibitors is highly challenging. Herein, we have used kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) to identify such inhibitors. Co&#8208;crystallization experiments revealed the binding mode of three different inhibitors with increasing potency and selectivity over related enzymes. Selected analogues engage ERAP2 in cells and inhibit antigen presentation in a cellular context.  4d  (  BDM88951  ) displays favorable in vitro ADME properties and in vivo exposure. In summary, KTGS allowed the discovery of the first nanomolar and selective highly promising ERAP2 inhibitors that pave the way of the exploration of the biological roles of this enzyme and provide lead compounds for drug discovery efforts.</dc:description>

         <title>Momomycin, an Antiproliferative Cryptic Metabolite from the Oxytetracycline Producer Streptomyces rimosus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural products provide an important source of pharmaceuticals and chemical tools. Traditionally, assessment of unexplored microbial phyla has led to new natural products. However, with every new microbe, the number of orphan biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) grows. As such, the more difficult proposition is finding new molecules from well&#8208;studied strains. Herein, we targeted Streptomyces rimosus, the widely&#8208;used oxytetracycline producer, for the discovery of new natural products. Using MALDI&#8208;MS&#8208;guided high&#8208;throughput elicitor screening (HiTES), we mapped the global secondary metabolome of S. rimosus and structurally characterized products of three cryptic BGCs, including momomycin, an unusual cyclic peptide natural product with back&#8208;bone modifications and several non&#8208;canonical amino acids. We elucidated important aspects of its biosynthesis and evaluated its bioactivity.

         <title>Work&#8208;function&#8208;induced Interfacial Built&#8208;in Electric Fields in Os&#8208;OsSe2 Heterostructures for Active Acidic and Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidirectional favorable charge balance effect is generated at the Os&#8208;OsSe2 interfaces via work function induced interfacial built&#8208;in electric field provides highly efficient HER active sites, accelerating the kinetics toward water electrolysis hydrogen production.







Abstract
Theoretical calculations unveil that the formation of Os&#8208;OsSe2 heterostructures with neutralized work function (WF) perfectly balances the electronic state between strong (Os) and weak (OsSe2) adsorbents and bidirectionally optimizes the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Os sites, significantly reducing thermodynamic energy barrier and accelerating kinetics process. Then, heterostructural Os&#8208;OsSe2 is constructed for the first time by a molten salt method and confirmed by in&#8208;depth structural characterization. Impressively, due to highly active sites endowed by the charge balance effect, Os&#8208;OsSe2 exhibits ultra&#8208;low overpotentials for HER in both acidic (26&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and alkaline (23&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) media, surpassing commercial Pt catalysts. Moreover, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen device assembled with Os&#8208;OsSe2 further highlights its potential application prospects. Profoundly, this special heterostructure provides a new model for rational selection of heterocomponents.

         <title>Design of Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Fast and Robust Organic Solvent Nanofiltration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D COF) is prepared as a membrane for highly permselective and robust organic solvent nanofiltration. The membrane has an unprecedented methanol permeance. High&#8208;performance purification of active pharmaceutical ingredients is also realized by the 3D COF membrane.







Abstract
Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) has become increasingly important in petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries, demanding superior and robust membranes. Herein, we report advanced OSN processes by designing three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D COF) membranes through moderated interfacial crystallization. Nanoporous supports work as the moderator allowing the crystallization of 3D COF membranes. The 3D COF features sub&#8208;nanometer and anti&#8208;swelling channels, affording a sharp selectivity to fine targets with an exceptionally high and stable methanol permeance. Thus&#8208;synthesized membrane exhibits a record stability against high&#8208;concentration feeds and long&#8208;term operation for &#8776;1000&#8197;h. Moreover, we unambiguously demonstrate that our membrane holds excellent practicality in purifying active pharmaceutical ingredients from organic liquids. This work reveals the great potential of distinctive 3D COFs in producing prominent OSN membranes for industrial applications.

         <title>Tug&#8208;of&#8208;War between Two Distinct Catalytic Sites Enables Fast and Selective Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of organocatalysts featuring two distinct catalytic sites in one molecule was illustrated in the ROCOP of epoxides with anhydride, giving excellent selectivity and activity. A chain tug&#8208;of&#8208;war mechanistic pathway is proposed to rationalize the simultaneous enhancement in monomer activation and nucleophilic attack, thus giving rise to outstanding catalytic performance.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening copolymerizations have emerged as a powerful approach towards the creation of sustainable polymers. Typical H&#8208;bonding catalysts for ring&#8208;opening are subject to a single catalytic site. Here we describe a H&#8208;bond&#8208;donor/Lewis&#8208;acidic&#8208;boron organocatalyst featuring two distinct catalytic sites in one molecule. The ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of epoxides with anhydride mediated by these modular, and tunable catalysts achieves high selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;% polyester selectivity) and markedly higher activity compared to either of the di&#8208;thiourea analogues or any combinations of them. Calculations and experimental studies reveal that the superior catalytic performance arises from tug&#8208;of&#8208;war between two differentiated catalytic sites: thiourea pulls off the propagating chain&#8208;end from boron center, simultaneously enhancing the role of monomer activation and also nucleophilicity of the propagation intermediates.

         <title>Tuning Proapoptotic Activity of a Phosphoric&#8208;Acid&#8208;Tethered Tetraphenylethene by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Triggered Isomerization and Switchable Protein Interactions for Cancer Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
The visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered trans&#8208;cis isomerization of a phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;substituted tetraphenylethene can be tuned by interaction with albumin. The trans and cis isomers show different interactions toward alkaline phosphatase and albumin, and have different cellular uptake efficiency and proapoptotic activity. Thus, on&#8208;demand activating and deactivating the proapoptotic effect has been achieved in vitro and in vivo by using visible light and proteins as switching elements.







Abstract
We herein report a phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;substituted tetraphenylethene (T&#8208;P) capable of adapting its geometric configuration and biological activity to the microenvironment upon light irradiation for apoptosis modulation. Different from most ultraviolet&#8208;responsive isomerization, T&#8208;P undergoes cis&#8208;trans isomerization under visible light irradiation, which is biocompatible and thus photo&#8208;modulation is possible in living biosystems. By using alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and albumin as dual targets, T&#8208;P isomers display different protein binding selectivity, cancer&#8208;cell internalization efficiency and apoptosis&#8208;inducing ability. The proapoptotic activity was found to be kinetically controlled by the enzymatic reaction with ALP and regulated by co&#8208;existing albumin. Motivated by these findings, two&#8208;way modulation of proapoptotic effect and on&#8208;demand boosting anticancer efficacy were realized in vitro and in vivo using light and endogenous proteins as multiple non&#8208;invasive switching stimuli.

         <title>Suppressing Electron Back&#8208;Donation for a Highly CO&#8208;tolerant Fuel Cell Anode Catalyst via Cobalt Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating Co into MoNi4 nanocatalyst can suppress the d&#8594;CO 2&#960;* back donation, leading to excellent CO tolerance. When feeding with CO (250&#8197;ppm)/H2, the fuel cell assembled by this catalyst yields a peak power density of 394&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, exceeding that of 209&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the Pt/C catalyst.







Abstract
Platinum on carbon (Pt/C) catalyst is commercially adopted in fuel cells but it undergoes formidable active&#8208;site poisoning by carbon monoxide (CO). In particular, given the sluggish kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC), the issues of Pt poisoning and slow rate would combine mutually, notably worsening the device performances. Here we overcome these challenges through incorporating cobalt (Co) into molybdenum&#8208;nickel alloy (MoNi4), termed Co&#8208;MoNi4, which not only shows superior HOR activity over the Pt/C catalyst in alkali, but more intriguingly exhibits excellent CO tolerance with only small activity decay after 10&#8201;000 cycles in the presence of 500 parts per million (ppm) CO. When feeding with CO (250&#8197;ppm)/H2, the AEMFC assembled by this catalyst yields a peak power density of 394&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, far exceeding the Pt/C catalyst. Experimental and computational studies reveal that weakened CO chemisorption originates from the electron&#8208;deficient Ni sites after Co incorporation that suppresses d&#8594;CO 2&#960;* back&#8208;donation.

         <title>Over 70&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency for CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol Enabled by Potassium Dopant&#8208;Tuned Interaction between Copper Sites and Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium doping of Cu2Se nanosheet arrays on copper foam serves as a versatile method for tuning the interaction between Cu sites and reaction intermediates. This approach enables CO2 electroreduction to ethanol as a single liquid product with a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 70.3&#8201;% and an extraordinary stability for 130&#8197;h at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V.







Abstract
It is highly desired yet challenging to steer the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2ER) toward ethanol with high selectivity, for which the evolution of reaction intermediates on catalytically active sites holds the key. Herein, we report that K doping in Cu2Se nanosheets array on Cu foam serves as a versatile way to tune the interaction between Cu sites and reaction intermediates in CO2ER, enabling highly selective production of ethanol. As revealed by characterization and simulation, the electron transfer from K to Se can stabilize CuI species which facilitate the adsorption of linear *COL and bridge *COB intermediates to promote C&#8722;C coupling during CO2ER. As a result, the optimized K11.2%&#8208;Cu2Se nanosheets array can catalyze CO2ER to ethanol as a single liquid product with high selectivity in a potential area from &#8722;0.6 to &#8722;1.2&#8197;V. Notably, it offers a Faradaic efficiency of 70.3&#8201;% for ethanol production at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V with as is stable for 130&#8197;h.

         <title>Between Elemental Match and Mismatch: From K12Ge3.5Sb6 to Salts of (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722;, (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722;, and (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722;</title>

         <dc:description>
Extraction of the intermetallic phase &#8220;K2GeSb&#8221;, actually comprising the new single&#8208;crystalline compound K12Ge3.5Sb6, yields the long sought&#8208;for binary anion (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722; and larger ones, (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722; and (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722;, which place the Ge/Sb combination at the border of elemental match and mismatch. The yet unknown diversity of these binary species predicts a rich follow&#8208;up chemistry.







Abstract
The solid mixture &#8220;K2GeSb&#8221; was shown to comprise single&#8208;crystalline K12Ge3.5Sb6 (1), a double salt of K5[GeSb3] with carbonate&#8208;like [GeSb3]5&#8722; anions, and the metallic Zintl phase K2Ge1.5. Extraction of 1 with ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine in the presence of crypt&#8208;222 afforded [K(crypt&#8208;222)]+ salts of several novel binary Zintl anions: (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722; (in 2), (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722; (in 3), and in the presence of [AuMePPh3] also (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722; (in 4). The anion in 2 represents a predicted, yet heretofore missing pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral anion. 4 comprises a cluster analogous to (Ge4Bi14)4&#8722; and (Ga2Bi16)4&#8722;, and thus one of the most Sb&#8208;rich binary p&#8208;block anions. The unprecedented cluster topology in 3 can be viewed as a defect&#8208;version of the one in 4 upon following a &#8220;dead end&#8221; of cluster growth. The findings indicate that Ge and Sb atoms are at the border of a well&#8208;matching and a mismatch elemental combination. We discuss the syntheses, the geometric structures, and the electronic structures of the new compounds.

         <title>(4+3) Annulation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes and Azadienes: Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of Azepanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azepanones are important and widespread seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, but their synthesis is challenging. A convergent method to access these scaffolds was developed relying on a (4+3) annulation reaction of azadienes and donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes. Good to excellent yields and high diastereoselectivity were achieved using Yb(OTf)3 as the catalyst. Asymmetric induction was possible with Cu(OTf)2 in the presence of a trisoxazoline (Tox) ligand.







Abstract
Azepanes are important seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, which are present in numerous natural and synthetic compounds. However, the development of convergent synthetic methods to access them remains challenging. Herein, we report the Lewis acid catalyzed (4+3) annulative addition of aryl and amino donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with 2&#8208;aza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes. Densely substituted azepane derivatives were obtained in good to excellent yields and with high diastereoselectivity. The reaction occurred under mild conditions with ytterbium triflate as the catalyst. The use of copper triflate with a trisoxazoline (Tox) ligand led to an enantioselective transformation. The obtained cycloadducts were convenient substrates for a series of further modifications, showing the synthetic utility of these compounds.

         <title>A SLC35C2 Transporter&#8208;Targeting Fluorescent Probe for the Selective Detection of B Lymphocytes Identified by SLC&#8208;CRISPRi and Unbiased Fluorescence Library Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a systematic SLC&#8208;CRISPRi library screening, the molecular target of CDyB was identified as the SLC35C2 transporter based on a gating&#8208;oriented live&#8208;cell distinction (GOLD) mechanism. Gene expression analysis and knock&#8208;out experiments confirmed that the SLC35C2 transporter acted as the target responsible for the selectivity of CDyB for B&#8208;cells over T&#8208;cells.







Abstract
T and B lymphocytes are two major adaptive immune cells in the human defense system. To real&#8208;time monitor their diverse functions, a live&#8208;cell&#8208;selective probe for only one cell type is need to investigate the complex interaction of the immune cells. Herein, a small&#8208;molecule probe CDyB for live B cells is developed by an unbiased fluorescence library screening. The cell selectivity was confirmed by multiparametric single&#8208;cell analysis using CyTOF. Through a systematic SLC&#8208;CRISPRi library screening, the molecular target of CDyB was identified as SLC35C2 transporter based on a gating&#8208;oriented live&#8208;cell distinction (GOLD) mechanism. The gene expression analysis and knock&#8208;out experiments validated that the SLC35C2 transporter was the target for CDyB distinction. Interestingly, when CDyB was applied to study B cell development, the CDyB fluorescence and SLC35C2 expression were positively correlated with the B cell maturation process, and not involved in the T cell development.

         <title>Au20(tBu3P)8: A Highly Symmetric Metalloid Gold Cluster in Oxidation State 0</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theoretically long&#8208;studied Au20 cluster was synthesized by a wet chemistry approach, solely stabilized by phosphine ligands. The presented superatom cluster possesses a high symmetrical structure and an oxidation state of the gold atoms of &#177;0.







Abstract
Metalloid gold clusters have unique properties with respect to size and structure and are key intermediates in studying transitions between molecular compounds and the bulk phase of the respective metal. In the following, the synthesis of the all&#8208;phosphine protected metalloid cluster Au20(tBu3P)8, solely built from gold atoms in the oxidation state of 0 is reported. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed a highly symmetric hollow cube&#8208;octahedral arrangement of the gold atoms, resembling gold bulk structure. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations illustrated the cluster can be described as a 20&#8208;electron superatom. Optical properties of the compound have shown molecular&#8208;like behavior.

         <title>Odorant Metabolism in Humans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complete passage and turnover of odorants within the human organism, beginning with the various routes of odorant uptake, followed by biotransformation and excretion are delineated in this Review. Special emphasis is placed on a comparison of the involved enzymes concerning the nasal, oral, respiratory tract and gastrointestinal metabolism of odorants and the respective functions of odorant metabolism in these body sites.







Abstract
Odorants are relatively small molecules which are easily taken up and distributed in the human body.

     alt="Odorant Metabolism in Humans"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete passage and turnover of odorants within the human organism, beginning with the various routes of odorant uptake, followed by biotransformation and excretion are delineated in this Review. Special emphasis is placed on a comparison of the involved enzymes concerning the nasal, oral, respiratory tract and gastrointestinal metabolism of odorants and the respective functions of odorant metabolism in these body sites.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odorants are relatively small molecules which are easily taken up and distributed in the human body. Despite their relevance in everyday life, however, only a limited amount of evidence about their metabolism, pathways, and bioactivities in the human body exists. With this Review, we aim to encourage future interdisciplinary research on the function and mechanisms of the biotransformation of odorants, involving different disciplines such as nutrition, medicine, biochemistry, chemistry, and sensory sciences. Starting with a general overview of the different ways of odorant uptake and enzymes involved in the metabolism of odorants, a more precise description of biotransformation processes and their function in the oral cavity, the nose, the lower respiratory tract (LRT), and the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is given together with an overview of the different routes of odorant excretion. Finally, perspectives for future research are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Calcination&#8208;regulated Microstructures of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Polymers towards Enhanced and Stable Photocatalytic H2O2 Production in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating molecular structure of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) polymer is a promising strategy to improve photoactivity. Herein, a porous nanorod&#8208;like D&#8208;A polymer is synthesized via a strategy of supramolecular chemistry combined with subsequent calcination treatment. This polymer consists of benzene rings (D) and triazine (A) that are linked by amido bond (&#8722;CONH&#8722;). &#8722;CONH&#8722; further partially cracks into cyano groups (&#8722;C&#8801;N) (A) under calcination. The ratio of benzene to triazine could be tuned to adjust the &#8722;C&#8801;N content by varying the calcination atmosphere. Such regulation of molecular structure could modulate the band structure of D&#8208;A polymer and endow it with unique porous nanorod&#8208;like morphology, leading to the achievement of two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction and two&#8208;electron water oxidation and the improvement of exciton splitting, O  2  adsorption and activation. These merits synergistically ensure a highly efficient and stable photocatalytic H  2  O  2  production in pure water.</dc:description>

         <title>Arene&#8722;Ruthenium(II)/Osmium(II) Complexes Potentiate the Anticancer Efficacy of Metformin via Glucose Metabolism Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting metabolic reprogramming to treat cancer could increase overall survival and reduce side effects. Here, we put forward a strategy using arene&#8722;ruthenium(II)/osmium(II) complexes to potentiate the anticancer effect of metformin (Met.) via glucose metabolism reprogramming. Complexes 1&#8208;6 with oxoglaucine derivatives as ligands were synthesized and their anti&#8208;tumor activities were tested under hypoglycemia. Results indicated that 2 and 5 potentiated the anticancer effects of Met. under hypoglycemia, exhibiting lower toxicity, slower blood glucose decline and inhibition of early tumor liver metastasis. Combination of 5 with Met. could be used as a new strategy to treat cancer under hypoglycemia through glucose metabolism reprogramming.</dc:description>

         <title>Encoding Morphogenesis of Quasi&#8208;Triangular Gold Nanoprisms with DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Properties of gold nanoparticles vary with their morphologies. Typically, the research on the properties and applications of the nonequilibrium intermediates generated by the morphological evolution of triangular gold nanoprisms is still incomplete. Herein, we employed thiol&#8208;DNA (HS&#8208;DNA) to protect the low&#8208;stability quasi&#8208;nanoprisms with different truncation degrees (  R  values). The presence of HS&#8208;DNA not only increases the stability of the quasi&#8208;nanoprisms in different microenvironment, but also facilitates us to investigate their intrinsic plasmonic properties related to morphology. Additionally, we served quasi&#8208;nanoprisms loaded with HS&#8208;DNA as assembly modules and nanoplatforms for programmable self&#8208;assembly higher&#8208;order hybrid structures, as well as carriers for encoding and decoding of orthogonal barcode&#8208;like information, which opens new opportunities for developing novel building blocks for light manipulation at nanoscale.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Depolymerizable Polyether Electrolytes for Convenient and Low&#8208;cost Recycling of LiTFSI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes(SPEs) with LiTFSI(Lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonimide)) are promising candidates for solid&#8208;state batteries, owing to their good interfacial contact with solid electrodes. Here, three copolymerized polyethers were prepared as SPEs, using the catalysts of SnF2 or SnF2&#8208;LiPF6. The thermal depolymerization of these polyethers was observed at elevated temperatures, which limits their operating temperature ranges. Once the catalyst is removed, the thermal degradation temperatures of these SPEs are raised by 30&#8208;55oC, together with improved thermal performance in cells. For SPEs, the high price of LiTFSI is an obstacle for their large&#8208;scale application, and it&#8217;s recycling is hindered by the strong interaction with polymers. By the thermal depolymerization of polyethers, LiTFSI can be easier reclaimed from above mentioned SPEs and even the commercial PEO(poly(ethylene&#8208;oxide)) based SPE in rates of 70&#8208;80%, providing a low&#8208;cost strategy for the recycling of LiTFSI.</dc:description>

         <title>A Monocrystalline Coordination Polymer with Multiple Redox Centers as a High&#8208;Performance Cathode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymers can take advantage of both transition metal redox and organic ligand redox, thus serving as promising cathodes with multiple redox centers toward higher&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Here, we selected the high&#8208;capacity carbonyl compound of chloranilic acid (CA) as organic ligand to coordinate with the high&#8208;voltage Cu  2+  as transition metal node and successfully synthesized copper(II) chloranilate (CuCA) with &#960;&#8211;d conjugation, layered structure and monocrystalline nature. The resulting CuCA presents inorganic and organic redox centers, high electronic conductivity and fast Li  +  diffusion kinetics, leading to high discharge capacity (297.0 mAh g  &#8211;1  at 50 mA g  &#8211;1  ), excellent rate capability (160.6 mAh g  &#8211;1  at 1000 mA g  &#8211;1  ) and good cycling stability (165.5 mAh g  &#8211;1  at 500 mA g  &#8211;1  after 50 cycles) with quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte. This work will provide insightful understanding of the materials design strategies to develop more efficient coordination polymer cathodes for LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Cage Binding Iodide Anion over Halide Ions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A triangular&#8208;prism shaped cage was self&#8208;assembled  via  the formation of a dynamic covalent bond, namely hydrazone, in acidic aqueous solution. The hexa&#8208;cationic host bears a number of relatively acidic protons pointing inward the cage cavity, which is able to accommodate an iodide anion selectively in water over other halide anions such as F  &#8722;  , Cl  &#8722;  and Br  &#8722;  , which are more hydrated. As a comparison, a macrocycle analogue bearing fewer positive charges and fewer hydrogen bond donors shows no anion binding ability. As inferred from the single crystal structure and theoretical calculations, the ability of the cage in selectively recognizing iodide anion results from the combination of electrostatic forces, C&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I  &#8722;  hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanographene Metallaprisms: Structure, Stimulated Transformation, and Emission Enhancement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanographenes are inclined to assemble into stacked columnar structures that are stabilized by p&#8208;p interactions, whereas other supramolecular structures of nanographenes, such as prisms and cages, are rarely investigated. Herein, a diazananographene was synthesized, and then assembled with coordination unit, producing a triangular metallaprism. After adding C  60  or C  70  , the triangular metallaprism was transformed into a square tetramer, which encapsulated a pair of C  60  or C  70  . The formed host&#8208;guest complex demonstrated the efficient energy transfer from diazananographene shell to C  60  cores. The emission intensity of capsulated C  60  was enhanced remarkably, compared with free C  60  , due to an increased quantum yield and optical absorption coefficient. This work demonstrates the versatility of nanographene&#8208;based supramolecular architectures beyond columnar stacking and their ability to enhance the emission of otherwise nonemissive fullerene.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective total synthesis of (&#8210;)&#8208;thallusin for bioactivity profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical mediators are key compounds for controlling symbiotic interactions in the environment. Here, we disclose a fully stereoselective total synthesis of the algae differentiation factor (&#8210;)&#8208;thallusin that utilizes unprecedented 6&#8208;  endo  &#8208;cyclization chemistry and effective late&#8208;stage sp  2  &#8208;sp  2  couplings using non&#8208;toxic reagents. An EC  50  of 4.8 pM was determined by quantitative phenotype profiling in the green seaweed  Ulva mutabilis  (Chlorophyte), underscoring this potent mediator's enormous, pan&#8208;species bioactivity produced by symbiotic bacteria. SAR investigations indicate that (&#8210;)&#8208;thallusin triggers at least two different pathways in  Ulva sp.  that may be separated by chemical editing of the mediator compound structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Cyclodehydrogenation of Trinaphthylamine: Selective Formation of a Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Polycyclic &#960;&#8208;System Comprising 5&#8208; and 7&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a new type of nitrogen&#8208;centered polycyclic scaffold comprising a unique combination of 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;membered rings. The compound is accessible through an intramolecular oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of tri(1&#8208;naphthyl)amine. To the best of our knowledge this is the very first example of a direct 3&#8208;fold cyclization of a triarylamine under oxidative conditions. The unusual ring fusion motif is confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and the impact of cyclization on the electronic and photophysical properties is investigated both experimentally and theoretically based on density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations. The formation of the unexpected product is rationalized by detailed mechanistic studies on the DFT level. The results suggest the cyclization to occur under kinetic control via a dicationic mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoretentive Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Allylation of Isoxazolinones by a Planar Chiral Palladacycle Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic allylic substitution is one of the most important tools in asymmetric synthesis to form C&#8208;C bonds in an enantioselective way. While high efficiency was previously accomplished in terms of enantio&#8208; and regiocontrol using different catalyst types, a strong general limitation is a very pronounced preference for the formation of allylic substitution products with (  E  )&#8208;configured C=C double bonds. Herein, we report that with a planar chiral palladacycle catalyst a diastereospecific reaction outcome is achieved using isoxazolinones and allylic imidates as substrates, thus maintaining the C=C double bond geometry of the allylic substrates in the highly enantioenriched products. DFT calculations show that the reactions proceed via an S  N  2 mechanism and not via &#960;&#8208;allyl Pd complexes. Crucial for the high control is the stabilization of the allylic fragment in the S  N  2 transition state by &#960;&#8208;interactions with the phenyl substituents of the pentaphenylferrocenyl catalyst core.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Diene&#8208;transmissive hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder sequences involving carbonyl dienophiles are reported for the first time. High enantioselectivities are achieved in the reaction of phenylglyoxal with a broad range of dendralene structures, through the optimization of a Pd2+ catalyst system. The initial catalyst&#8208;controlled enantioselective oxa&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (ODA) cycloaddition to a [3]dendralene generates a dihydropyran carrying a semicyclic diene. This participates in a subsequent catalyst or substrate&#8208;controlled Diels&#8208;Alder reaction to generate sp3&#8208;rich fused polycyclic systems containing both heterocycles and carbocycles. Computational investigations reveal a concerted asynchronous mechanism. &#960;&#8208;Complexation of a diene C=C bond to Pd2+ occurs in both the pre&#8208;transition state (TS) complex and in cycloaddition TSs, controlling stereoselectivity. A formal enantioselective [4+2]cycloaddition of a CO2 dienophile is demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;cell multiplexing is key to exploration of the heterogeneous cell populations in biological systems. Although the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mass cytometry (CyTOF) possesses high resolution and multiple dimensions, the lack of suitable marker materials prohibits fully exploiting the available CyTOF detection channels. Here we report a new design strategy for CyTOF markers using functionalized mesoporous porphyrinic frameworks (MPFs) as scaffolds for chelating metals that have been unachievable by conventional approaches. We developed surface modification for stably dispersing the MPF nanoparticles (&lt;40 nm) during the metalation and antibody conjugation processes. Our markers exhibit higher sensitivity and comparable specificity compared with a polymer&#8208;based commercial benchmark. Compatibility with commercial markers during co&#8208;staining was also confirmed. Furthermore, our markers show promising performance for immunophenotyping and potential implementation in CyTOF systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Brook Rearrangements: Concept and Recent Developments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical Brook rearrangement is a unique molecular arrangement, but it is not highly explored in synthetic chemistry. This Minireview summarizes the early developments and general concept of radical Brook rearrangements and highlights the recent advances in photocatalytic reactions and transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving radical Brook rearrangements.







Abstract
The Brook rearrangement has already become established as one of the most important molecular rearrangements in synthetic chemistry and has been applied in the generation of complexes, drug discovery, material science, and natural products synthesis. Compared to the widely known ionic mechanism, the radical Brook rearrangement is less explored because of the difficulty in generating alkoxyl radical species.

     alt="Radical Brook Rearrangements: Concept and Recent Developments"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The radical Brook rearrangement is a unique molecular arrangement, but it is not highly explored in synthetic chemistry. This Minireview summarizes the early developments and general concept of radical Brook rearrangements and highlights the recent advances in photocatalytic reactions and transition-metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions involving radical Brook rearrangements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brook rearrangement has already become established as one of the most important molecular rearrangements in synthetic chemistry and has been applied in the generation of complexes, drug discovery, material science, and natural products synthesis. Compared to the widely known ionic mechanism, the radical Brook rearrangement is less explored because of the difficulty in generating alkoxyl radical species. This Minireview summarizes the early developments and general concept of the radical Brook rearrangement and highlights recent advances in photocatalytic reactions and transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions involving radical Brook rearrangements. We hope this survey will inspire further developments in this emerging area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Traceless Site&#8208;Specific Conjugation on Native Antibodies Enables Efficient One&#8208;Step Payload Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A traceless one&#8208;step synthesis of site&#8208;specific antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) has been established using a novel thioester&#8208;based acyl transfer design with an optimized Fc&#8208;binding ligand, which enables ligand self&#8208;release during payload assembly. This strategy exhibits excellent compatibility with various toxins, linkers, and IgG subclasses, implying the potential for broad applications in ligand&#8208;directed protein modifications.







Abstract
Direct chemical modification of native antibodies in a site&#8208;specific manner remains a great challenge. Ligand&#8208;directed conjugation can achieve the selective modification of antibodies, but usually requires multiple extra steps for ligand release and cargo assembly. Herein, we report a novel, traceless strategy to enable the facile and efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of site&#8208;specific antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) by harnessing a thioester&#8208;based acyl transfer reagent. The designed reagent, consisting of an optimized Fc&#8208;targeting ligand, a thioester bridge and a toxin payload, directly assembles the toxin precisely onto the K251 position of native IgGs and simultaneously self&#8208;releases the affinity ligand in one step. With this method, we synthesized a series of K251&#8208;linked ADCs from native Trastuzumab. These ADCs demonstrated excellent homogeneity, thermal stability, and both in vitro and in vivo anti&#8208;tumor activity. This strategy is equally efficient for IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 subtypes.

         <title>Lysosome Interference Enabled by Proton&#8208;Driven Dynamic Assembly of DNA Nanoframeworks inside Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;driven dynamic assembly of DNA nanoframeworks inside cells couples with the lysosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis pathways/lysosomal maturation to give the rational modulation of lysosomal functions. These include lysosomal acidity reduction and hydrolase activity attenuation, thereby improving the delivery efficiency of nucleic acid drugs.







Abstract
Coupling materials chemistry systems to biological processes is a promising way to rationally modulate lysosomal functions. A proton&#8208;driven dynamic assembly of a DNA nanoframework inside cells coupled with the lysosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis pathways/lysosomal maturation, gives the rational modulation of lysosomal functions, which we term &#8220;lysosome interference&#8221;. Through lysosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis, the DNA nanoframework with acid&#8208;responsive semi&#8208;i&#8208;motif enters the lysosome and assembles into an aggregate in a process triggered by lysosomal acidity. The aggregate is suitable for long&#8208;term retention. The consumption of protons resulted in lysosomal acidity reduction and hydrolase activity attenuation, thus hindering the degradation of nucleic acid drugs in the lysosome and improving gene silencing effects. This study shows a new way to achieve lysosome interference by coupling the subcellular microenvironment with a precisely programmable assembly system.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectric &#945;&#8208;Ag9Ga1&#8722;xTe6 Compounds with Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity Originating from Ag9Te2 Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;temperature crystal structure of &#945;&#8208;Ag9GaTe6 shows a hexagonal structure. Highly disordered Ag atoms vibrate in&#8208;harmonically leading to an intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity. Meanwhile, the deficiency of Ga in Ag9Ga1&#8722;xTe6 compounds effectively optimizes the electronic transport properties. All these factors contribute to an improved thermoelectric Figure of Merit ZT value of 1.13 at 623&#8197;K for Ag9Ga0.95Te6.







Abstract
We have determined the complex atomic structure of high&#8208;temperature &#945;&#8208;Ag9GaTe6 phase with a hexagonal lattice (P63mc space group, a=b=8.2766&#8197;&#197;, c=13.4349&#8197;&#197;). The structure has outer [GaTe4]5&#8722; tetrahedrons and inner [Ag9Te2]5+ clusters. All of the Ag ions are disorderly distributed in the lattice. Seven types of the Ag atoms constitute the cage&#8208;like [Ag9Te2]5+ clusters. The highly disordered Ag ions vibrate in&#8208;harmonically, producing strong coupling between low frequency optical phonons and acoustic phonons. This in conjunction with a low sound velocity of 1354&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1 leads to an ultralow thermal conductivity of 0.20&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 673&#8197;K. Meanwhile, the deficiency of Ga in Ag9Ga1&#8722;xTe6 compounds effectively optimizes the electronic transport properties. Ag9Ga0.91Te6 attains a highest power factor of 0.40&#8197;mW&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 at 673&#8197;K. All these contribute to a much&#8208;improved ZT value of 1.13 at 623&#8197;K for Ag9Ga0.95Te6, which is 41&#8201;% higher than that of the pristine Ag9GaTe6 sample.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Triggered Polar Polymorph Formation: &#946;&#8208;Sc(IO3)3, a Promising Next&#8208;Generation Mid&#8208;Infrared Nonlinear Optical Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key mechanism of additives in the formation of noncentrosymmetric solids has been clarified for the first time based on a new metastable &#946;&#8208;Sc(IO3)3, which exhibits excellent mid&#8208;IR NLO properties including the strongest SHG responses and the largest band gap for a rare&#8208;earth iodate, a sufficient birefringence, and a wide optical transparency window.







Abstract
Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) solids have attracted interest for their potential in ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and nonlinear optical (NLO) devices, but their synthesis remains a major challenge. In this study, the additive Li2CO3 triggers formation of an NCS precursor at an early nucleation stage, and plays a crucial role in the successful polymorphism transformation. The resultant metastable &#946;&#8208;Sc(IO3)3 is a promising mid&#8208;infrared NLO crystal, with the strongest second&#8208;harmonic generation responses (2.2&#215;KTiOPO4 @ 2100&#8197;nm, 16&#215;KH2PO4 @ 1064&#8197;nm) and the largest optical band gap (4.52&#8197;eV) for a rare&#8208;earth iodate, as well as sufficient birefringence (&#916;n=0.219 @ 546&#8197;nm) for type I phase&#8208;matching, and wide optical transparency, which are induced by optimal alignment of the iodate anions. This study reveals the key role of additives in the growth of polar NCS solids, a discovery with implications for the strategic design of new NCS polymorphism materials with exceptional NLO properties.

The resultant metastable &#946;-Sc(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a promising mid-infrared NLO crystal, with the strongest second-harmonic generation responses (2.2&#215;KTiOPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; @ 2100&#8197;nm, 16&#215;KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; @ 1064&#8197;nm) and the largest optical band gap (4.52&#8197;eV) for a rare-earth iodate, as well as sufficient birefringence (&#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=0.219 @ 546&#8197;nm) for type I phase-matching, and wide optical transparency, which are induced by optimal alignment of the iodate anions. This study reveals the key role of additives in the growth of polar NCS solids, a discovery with implications for the strategic design of new NCS polymorphism materials with exceptional NLO properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Reactivity of a Geometrically Constrained Phosphenium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geometrically constrained phosphenium cation 1+ was synthesized and its reactivity was studied. While 1+ reacts with MeOH and Et2NH via P&#8208;center/ligand assisted path, its reaction with Et3SiH proceeds via oxidative addition type reaction affording new PV intermediate. The ability of 1+ to activate Si&#8722;H bond was tested in catalytic hydrosilylation of benzaldehyde, where 1+ closely mimics transition metal behaviour.







Abstract
A geometrically constrained phosphenium cation in bis(pyrrolyl)pyridine based NNN pincer type ligand (1+) was synthesized, isolated and its preliminary reactivity was studied with small molecules. 1+ reacts with MeOH and Et2NH, activating the O&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds via a P&#8208;center/ligand assisted path. The reaction of 1+ with one equiv. of H3NBH3 leads to its dehydrogenation producing 5. Interestingly, reaction of 1+ with an excess H3NBH3 leads to phosphinidene (PI) species coordinating to two BH3 molecules (6). In contrast, [1+][OTf] reacts with Et3SiH by hydride abstraction yielding 1&#8208;H and Et3SiOTf, while [1+][B(C6F5)4] reacts with Et3SiH via an oxidative addition type reaction of Si&#8722;H bond to P&#8208;center, affording a new PV compound (8). However, 8 is not stable over time and degrades to a complex mixture of compounds in matter of minutes. Despite this, the ability of [1+][B(C6F5)4] to activate Si&#8722;H bond could still be tested in catalytic hydrosilylation of benzaldehyde, where 1+ closely mimics transition metal behaviour.

         <title>Zirconium&#8208;oxo Nodes of MOFs with Tunable Electronic Properties Provide Effective &#8901;OH Species for Enhanced Methane Hydroxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts modified with various ligands can directly convert CH4 into oxygenates with 100&#8201;% selectivity by using H2O2 as an oxidant under mild conditions. The Zr&#8208;oxo nodes have different electronic properties that affected the anchoring of &#8901;OH species to form effective Zroxo&#8722;&#8901;OH sites. These sites promote the activation of the C&#8722;H bond of CH4.







Abstract
Direct conversion of methane to high value&#8208;added oxygenates under mild conditions has attracted extensive interest. However, the over&#8208;oxidation of target products is usually unavoidable due to the easily excessive activation of C&#8722;H bond on the sites of supported metal species. Here, we identified the most efficient Zr&#8208;oxo nodes of UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts for the selective oxidation of methane with H2O2. These nodes were modified by three types of benzene 1, 4&#8208;dicarboxylates (NH2&#8208;BDC, H2BDC, and NO2&#8208;BDC). Detailed characterizations and DFT calculations revealed that these ligands can effectively tune the electronic properties of Zr&#8208;oxo nodes and the H2BDC ligand led to optimal electronic density of Zr&#8208;oxo nodes in UiO&#8208;66. Thus the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H catalyst promoted the formation of &#8901;OH species that adsorbed on Zr&#8208;oxo nodes, and facilitated the activation of methane with a lower energy barrier and subsequent conversion to hydroxylation oxygenates with 100&#8201;% selectivity.

         <title>PEG&#8208;Functionalized Hollow Multishelled Structures with On&#8208;Off Switch and Rate&#8208;Regulation for Controllable Antimicrobial Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel functionalized hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) has hierarchical shells as multilevel responsive bodies and uses polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a gated regulator. The interaction between PEG&#8208;functionalized shells endows them with a pH&#8208;responsive switch and rate&#8208;regulator capability. These features allow rapid release of molecules wrapped in the outer shell, and controlled diffusion of antimicrobials stored in the inner shell.







Abstract
The construction of responsive antimicrobial carriers with multifunctional and controllable release is an attractive but challenging proposition. Recently developed hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) offers structural advantages, such as easily modifiable surfaces and mutually influenced shells. Herein, we report a novel pH&#8208;responsive antimicrobial carrier having hierarchical shells as multilevel responsive bodies using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a gated regulator. The interaction between PEG&#8208;functionalized shells endows them with a pH&#8208;responsive switch and rate&#8208;regulator capability. These features are present in the form of rapid release of molecules wrapped in the outer shell, and controlled diffusion of antimicrobials stored in the inner shell by electrostatic interaction, resulting in a long&#8208;lasting mildew resistance for up to 71&#8197;days. The versatility of the hierarchical interactions of HoMSs will inspire the design of promising smart drug carriers.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen bonding (ChB) interactions are used for the first time to organize photoreactive systems, here (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (bpen) molecules, into rectangular motifs favoring cyclobutane formation through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2+2] photodimerizations, demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of strong and directional ChB donors such as selenocyanate moieties toward topochemical reactions.







Abstract
The face&#8208;to&#8208;face association of (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (bpen) molecules into rectangular motifs stabilized for the first time by chalcogen bonding (ChB) interactions is shown to provide photoreactive systems leading to cyclobutane formation through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2+2] photodimerizations. The chelating chalcogen bond donors are based on original aromatic, ortho&#8208;substituted bis(selenocyanato)benzene derivatives 1&#8211;3, prepared from ortho&#8208;diboronic acid bis(pinacol) ester precursors and SeO2 and malononitrile in 75&#8211;90&#8201;% yield. The very short intramolecular Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se distance in 1&#8211;3 (3.22&#8211;3.24&#8197;&#197;), a consequence of a strong intramolecular ChB interaction, expands to 3.52&#8211;3.54&#8197;&#197; in the chalcogen&#8208;bonded adducts with bpen, a distance (&lt;4&#8197;&#197;) well adapted to the face&#8208;to&#8208;face association of the bpen molecules into the reactive position toward photochemical dimerization.

The chelating chalcogen bond donors are based on original aromatic, &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-substituted bis(selenocyanato)benzene derivatives &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, prepared from &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-diboronic acid bis(pinacol) ester precursors and SeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and malononitrile in 75&#8211;90&#8201;% yield. The very short &lt;i&gt;intramolecular&lt;/i&gt; Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se distance in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; (3.22&#8211;3.24&#8197;&#197;), a consequence of a strong intramolecular ChB interaction, expands to 3.52&#8211;3.54&#8197;&#197; in the chalcogen-bonded adducts with &lt;b&gt;bpen&lt;/b&gt;, a distance (&amp;lt;4&#8197;&#197;) well adapted to the face-to-face association of the &lt;b&gt;bpen&lt;/b&gt; molecules into the reactive position toward photochemical dimerization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ultramicroporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Exhibiting High C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a suitable pore environment and complementary electrostatic potential distribution fitting well to acetylene (C2H2) molecule, the ultramicroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 exhibits extra strong affinity to C2H2 (46.73&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and the highest IAST selectivity of 6675 for C2H2/CO2 separation.







Abstract
The separation of C2H2/CO2 is not only industrially important for acetylene purification but also great scientific challenge due to their very similar molecular size and physical properties. To address this difficulty, herein, we present an ultramicroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1) from tetracyano bicarbazole to separate C2H2 from CO2 by taking advantage of differences in their electrostatic potential distribution. This material possesses a suitable pore environment and electrostatic potential distribution fitting well to C2H2, thus showing extra strong affinity to C2H2 (46.73&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and the highest IAST selectivity of 6675 for C2H2/CO2 separation among the adsorbents reported. The single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the suitable pore environment in HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 provides multiple C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonded interactions N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C with C2H2 molecules. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate its outstanding separation performance to C2H2/CO2 mixtures.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Programmable AgAuS&#8208;Primed Conductive Nanowelding Wires&#8208;Up Wet Colloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;based, DNA&#8208;programmable, and highly efficient nanowelding process generates conductive threads in self&#8208;assembled nanoparticle &#8220;molecules&#8221; and &#8220;polymers&#8221;. The process starts with a gap&#8208;specific Ag2S deposition in pre&#8208;formed gold nanostructures. It ends with Ag2S&#8208;directed gold&#8208;atom diffusion and a reduction of the resulting AgAuS primer phase to give conductive Au/Ag alloyed junctions.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of nanomaterials, directed by molecular or supramolecular interactions, is a powerful strategy to build nanoscale devices. Despite many advantages of such solution&#8208;based processes, a big challenge is to realize interparticle ohmic contacts toward facilitated charge transport over a long distance. We report a new concept of primed nanowelding to thread solution&#8208;borne nanoparticles in prescribed assemblies. The process starts with a gap&#8208;specific deposition of Ag2E (E=S, Se) materials in pre&#8208;assembled gold structures, which spontaneously transform into AgAuE semiconductors via directional gold diffusion. Treatment with tributylphosphine generates alloyed Au/Ag welding spots that conductively wire&#8208;up nanoparticles into discrete &#8220;molecules&#8221; and micron&#8208;long &#8220;polymers&#8221;. This method is compatible with DNA programming and delivers a possible way to solve the problem of the carrier&#8208;transport dilemma in solution&#8208;processed nanostructures for better&#8208;functioning nanodevices.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supported&#160;gold nanoparticle catalysts have attracted growing interest in aerobic&#160;oxidation reactions. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202205873), Kazuya Yamaguchi, Kosuke Suzuki et&#8197;al. describe&#160;a&#160;method for the design of supported anionic gold nanoparticle catalysts using negatively&#160;charged multivacant polyoxometalates. The electronic states of the&#160;catalysts&#160;can be sequentially modulated, and the catalyst prepared&#160;using [SiW9O34]10&#8722; acted as a reusable heterogeneous catalyst, showing&#160;superior&#160;catalytic activity and enhanced stability compared to conventional catalysts.

         <title>BTDAzo: A Photoswitchable TRPC5 Channel Activator
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TRPs (Transient Receptor Potentials) are important sensory ion channels with roles in perception including of heat, cold, and electrophiles, as well as in signaling and mineralostasis. Here the first photopharmaceutical TRPC5 ligand, BTDAzo, is developed, which achieves outstanding photoswitchability of TRPC5 currents in physiological models including brain slice, without crosstalk to the related TRPC4 channel.







Abstract
Photoswitchable reagents can be powerful tools for high&#8208;precision biological control. TRPC5 is a Ca2+&#8208;permeable cation channel with distinct tissue&#8208;specific roles, from synaptic function to hormone regulation. Reagents giving spatiotemporally&#8208;resolved control over TRPC5 activity may be key to understanding and harnessing its biology. Here we develop the first photoswitchable TRPC5&#8208;modulator, BTDAzo, to address this goal. BTDAzo can photocontrol TRPC5 currents in cell culture, as well as controlling endogenous TRPC5&#8208;based neuronal Ca2+ responses in mouse brain slices. BTDAzos are also the first reported azo&#8208;benzothiadiazines, an accessible and conveniently derivatised azoheteroarene with strong two&#8208;colour photoswitching. BTDAzo&#8242;s ability to control TRPC5 across relevant channel biology settings makes it suitable for a range of dynamically reversible photoswitching studies in TRP channel biology, with the aim to decipher the various biological roles of this centrally important ion channel.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining the ONOO&#8722;&#8208;initiated cascade reactions of a novel chemical trigger and a new NIR emissive Rhodol fluorophore, an activity&#8208;based NIR fluorescent probe for ONOO&#8722; in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains was constructed. Real&#8208;time imaging of ONOO&#8722; in AD mice and age&#8208;dependent accumulation of ONOO&#8722; in AD mouse brains have been demonstrated with the probe.







Abstract
Peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) plays a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To reveal the ONOO&#8722; influx in AD brains, an activatable activity&#8208;based fluorescence probe Rd&#8208;DPA3 was designed by a structure&#8208;modulated strategy. Taking advantage of ONOO&#8722;&#8208;initiated two&#8208;step cascade reactions of a novel chemical trigger, Rd&#8208;DPA3 specifically responds to ONOO&#8722; in 0.3&#8197;mM of other reactive oxygen species (ROS) and varied proteins, and gives an intensive fluorescence enhancement (F/F0=50). Moreover, with its mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability, Rd&#8208;DPA3 can be used to efficiently monitor the alternations of intracellular ONOO&#8722; levels in cerebral cells during oxidative stress. Significantly, due to NIR emission and good blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) crossing ability, Rd&#8208;DPA3 is suitable for in vivo imaging of cerebral ONOO&#8722; influx and illustrating an age&#8208;dependent accumulation of ONOO&#8722; in AD mice brains.

A cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene&#8208;stabilized 1,4&#8208;diborabenzene ligand enables the isolation of thermally stable two&#8208;legged parent piano&#8208;stool Fe0 and Ru0 complexes. The iron complex reacts with P4 and As4 to yield mixed diborabenzene&#8208;cyclo&#8208;E4 sandwich complexes with planar E42&#8722; ligands. Computational analyses confirm the strong electron&#8208;donating capacity of the DBB ligand and show that the E4 ligand is bound by four equivalent Fe&#8722;P &#963; bonds.

         <title>Low&#8208;Pt NiNC&#8208;Supported PtNi Nanoalloy Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalysts&#8212;In Situ Tracking of the Atomic Alloying Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During thermal annealing treatment, carbon&#8208;encapsulated Ni NPs, rather than NiNx single sites, serve exclusively as the Ni atom source for PtNi alloy formation. Despite this low Pt weight loading, the catalysts exhibit more favorable Pt&#8208;mass activities compared to conventional, carbon&#8208;supported 20&#8211;30&#8197;wt&#8201;%Pt Pt&#8208;loaded benchmark PtNi alloy catalysts.







Abstract
We report and analyze a synthetic strategy toward low&#8208;Pt platinum&#8208;nickel (Pt&#8208;Ni) alloy nanoparticle (NP) cathode catalysts for the catalytic electroreduction of molecular oxygen to water. The synthesis involves the pyrolysis and leaching of Ni&#8208;organic polymers, subsequent Pt NP deposition, followed by thermal alloying, resulting in single Ni atom site (NiNC)&#8208;supported PtNi alloy NPs at low Pt weight loadings of only 3&#8211;5&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Despite low Pt weight loading, the catalysts exhibit more favorable Pt&#8208;mass activities compared to conventional 20&#8211;30&#8197;wt&#8201;% benchmark PtNi catalysts. Using in situ microscopic techniques, we track and unravel the key stages of the PtNi alloy formation process directly at the atomic scale. Surprisingly, we find that carbon&#8208;encapsulated metallic Ni@C structures, rather than NiNx sites, act as the Ni source during alloy formation. Our materials concepts offer a pathway to further decrease the overall Pt content in hydrogen fuel cell cathodes.

         <title>Molecularly Precise, Bright, Photostable, and Biocompatible Cyanine Nanodots as Alternatives to Quantum Dots for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanine nanodots constructed by step&#8208;by&#8208;step divergent synthesis of cyanine dye&#8208;cored polylysine dendrimers possess many of the merits of quantum dots and organic fluorophores, including precise structure, well&#8208;defined size, strong and stable fluorescence, and a customizable fluorescence spectrum. A strategy is described for synthesis of various precise fluorescent nanoparticles with optical properties that are relevant to biomedical applications.







Abstract
Fluorescent imaging with fluorophores has become a powerful way to explore complex biological systems and visualize nanoparticles for drug delivery. However, it is challenging to develop fluorophores with ideal physical and optical properties. We report a method to synthesize cyanine nanodots with a single&#8208;molecule structure, well&#8208;defined particle size, customizable fluorescent spectrum, and bright and stable fluorescence. These cyanine nanodots are acquired by the divergent synthesis of cyanine&#8208;dye&#8208;cored polylysine (PLL) dendrimers. We demonstrated the feasibility of the method by synthesizing cyanine 3 (Cy3), cyanine 5 (Cy5), or cyanine 7 (Cy7) cored single&#8208;molecule nanodots up to eight generations with a size of around 11&#8197;nm. We show that these cyanine nanodots are capable of multiple biomedical applications, including multicolor cellular tracing and cancer imaging. These cyanine nanodots possess many merits of organic dots and quantum dots that are promising for future application.

         <title>Rational Design of Superconducting Metal Hydrides via Chemical Pressure Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high critical superconducting temperatures (  T  c  s) of metal hydride phases with clathrate&#8208;like hydrogen networks have generated great interest. Herein, we employ the Density Functional Theory&#8208;Chemical Pressure (DFT&#8208;CP) method to explain why certain electropositive elements adopt these structure types, whereas others distort the hydrogenic lattice, thereby decreasing the  T  c  . The progressive opening of the H  24  polyhedra in MH  6  phases is shown to arise from internal pressures exerted by large metal atoms, some of which may favor an even higher hydrogen content that loosens the metal atom coordination environments. The stability of the LaH  10  and LaBH  8  phases is tied to stuffing of their shared hydrogen network with either additional hydrogen or boron atoms. The predictive capabilities of DFT&#8208;CP are finally applied to the Y&#8208;X&#8208;H system to identify possible ternary additions yielding a superconducting phase stable to low pressures.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Thianthrenium Carbonyl Species: The Equivalent of an &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Carbocation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report an &#945;&#8208;thianthrenium carbonyl species, as the equivalent of an &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbocation, which is generated by the radical conjugate addition of a trifluoromethyl thianthrenium salt to Michael acceptors. The reactivity allows for the synthesis of C&#945;&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino acid analogues via a Ritter reaction by addition of acetonitrile. Addition of hydroxide, methoxide, and even fluoride can afford &#945;&#8208;heteroatom substituted &#945;&#8208;phenylpropanoates.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation of Organic Acids and Carbonyl Compounds in&#160;n&#8208;Butane Oxidation via&#160;&#947;&#8208;Ketohydroperoxide Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A crucial chain&#8208;branching step in autoignition is the decomposition of ketohydroperoxides (KHP) to form an oxy radical and OH. Other pathways compete with chain&#8208;branching, such as &#8220;Korcek&#8221; dissociation of &#947;&#8208;KHP to a carbonyl and an acid. Here we characterize the formation of a &#947;&#8208;KHP and its decomposition to formic acid + acetone products from observations of  n  &#8209;butane oxidation in two complementary experiments. In jet&#8208;stirred reactor measurements, KHP is observed above 590 K. The KHP concentration decreases with increasing temperature, whereas formic acid and acetone products increase. Observation of characteristic isotopologs acetone&#8209;  d  3  and formic acid&#8208;  d  0  in the oxidation of CH  3  CD  2  CD  2  CH  3  is consistent with a Korcek mechanism. In laser&#8208;initiated oxidation experiments of  n  &#8208;butane, formic acid and acetone are produced on the timescale of KHP removal. Modelling the time&#8208;resolved production of formic acid provides an estimated upper limit of 2 s  &#8209;1  for the rate coefficient of KHP decomposition to formic acid + acetone.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A nickel&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component carbonylative crosscoupling reaction of allylic alcohols and organoalanes with CO at atmospheric pressure is reported, enabling the expedient formation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with broad scope. Particularly, the chemoselective allylic carbonylation of diols further highlights the practicability of this protocol. The leverage of organoalanes as both the coupling components and the activators for the alcohol functionalization is crucial for this method, thus no extraneous activators are required.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Over Atomically Dispersed&#160;Synergistic &#160;Ni/Co Dual Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are being pursued as economical electrocatalysts. However, their low active&#8208;site loading, poor interactions, and unclear catalytic mechanism call for significant advances. Herein, atomically dispersed Ni/Co dual sites anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (a&#8208;NiCo/NC) hollow prisms are rationally designed and synthesized. Benefiting from the atomically dispersed dual&#8208;metal sites and their synergistic interactions, the obtained a&#8208;NiCo/NC sample exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity and kinetics towards the oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, density functional theory calculations indicate that the strong synergistic interactions from heteronuclear paired Ni/Co dual sites lead to the optimization of the electronic structure and the reduced reaction energy barrier. This work provides a promising strategy for the synthesis of high&#8208;efficiency atomically dispersed dual&#8208;site SACs in the field of electrochemical energy storage and conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying and Differentiating Topological G&#8208;Quadruplex Structures with DNA&#8208;encoded Plasmonic Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) have been identified as critical elements in modulating genomic functions and many other biological processes. Their functions are highly dependent on the primary nucleotides and secondary folding structures. Therefore, to understand their functions, methods to identify and differentiate structures of G4 with speed and accuracy are required but limited. In this report, we have applied a synthetic G4 DNA&#8208;encoded nanoparticle approach to identify and differentiate G4 DNA molecules with different topologies and nucleotide residues. We found that the resulting plasmonic properties of the gold nanoparticles, monitored by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, are quite sensitive to different G4 structures, including stacking layers, loop sequences, capping bases on G4s, and topological structures. Through these systematic investigations, we demonstrate that this G4&#8208;encoded gold nanoparticle approach can be used to profile the G4 structures and distinguish G4s from human telomeres. Such a method may have wide applications in G4 research.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We present SpeedMixing, a rapid blending technology, as an approach for fast mechanosynthesis and discovery of model pharmaceutical cocrystals through rapid spinning in the absence of bulk solvents and milling/grinding media. Syntheses of pharmaceutical cocrystals based on the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) carbamazepine, dihydrocarbamazepine, and nicotinamide demonstrate SpeedMixing as a method for rapid, scalable, as well as controllable and selective synthesis of cocrystals, cocrystal polymorphs and stoichiomorphs, including the discovery of an unexpected methanol solvate of the archetypal cocrystal of carbamazepine and saccharin, which has eluded numerous extensive screens over 20 years.</dc:description>

         <title>Central Unit&#160;Fluorination&#160;of Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptor Enables Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells with Over 18% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogenations on terminal of acceptors have been proven to render dramatical improvements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Despite rare studies, similar significant results could be also expected if halogenations on central units of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Y&#8208;series acceptors is applied, given that central units have been proved to impact molecular packings significantly. Herein, a pair of acceptors, CH6 and CH4, featured with conjugation&#8208;extended control phenazine central unit with/out fluorination, have been designed/synthesized. The extra fluorination on CH6 leads to an enhanced molecular interaction and crystallinity, superior fibrillar network morphology and improved charge generation/transport in blend films, thus affording a higher PCE of 18.33% for CH6&#8208;based binary OSCs comparing to that of 16.49% for CH4. Our work provides an exciting platform with the new central site for further structural optimization on Y&#8208;series molecules to afford better&#8208;performed OSCs and reveals the effectiveness of fluorination on central units.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Catalysed Selective Aerobic Oxidation of Methane to Formaldehyde in the Presence of Liquid Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aerobic, selective oxidation of methane to C  1  &#8208;oxygenates remains a challenge, due to the more facile, consecutive oxidation of formed products to CO  2  . Here, we report on the aerobic selective oxidation of methane under continuous flow conditions, over platinum&#8208;based catalysts yielding formaldehyde with a high selectivity (reaching 90% for Pt/TiO  2  and 65% over Pt/Al  2  O  3  ) upon co&#8208;feeding water. The presence of liquid water under reaction conditions increases the activity strongly attaining a methane conversion of 1&#8208;3% over Pt/TiO  2  . Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the preferential formation of formaldehyde is linked to the stability of the di&#8208;s&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;methoxy species on platinum the preferred carbon&#8208;containing species on Pt(111) at a high chemical potential of water. Our findings provide novel insights into the reaction pathway for the Pt&#8208;catalysed, aerobic selective oxidation of CH  4  .</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) provides a green route for decentralized H2O2 synthesis, where astructure&#8208;selectivity relationship is pivotal for the control of a highly selective and active two&#8208;electron pathway. Here, we report the fabrication of a boron and nitrogen co&#8208;doped turbostratic carbon catalyst with tunable B&#8208;N&#8208;C configurations (CNB&#8208;ZIL) by the assistance of a zwitterionic liquid (ZIL) for electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production. Combined spectroscopic analysis reveals a fine tailored B&#8208;N moiety in CNB&#8208;ZIL, where interfacial B&#8208;N species in a homogeneous distribution tend to segregate into hexagonal boron nitride domains at higher pyrolysis temperatures. Based on the experimental observations, a correlation between the interfacial B&#8208;N moieties and HO2&#8208; selectivity is established. The CNB&#8208;ZIL electrocatalysts with optimal interfacial B&#8208;N moieties exhibit a high HO2&#8208; selectivity with small overpotentials in alkaline media, giving a HO2&#8208; yield of ~1787 mmol gcatalyst&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 at &#8208;1.4 V in a flow&#8208;cell reactor.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of a Rhamnose&#8208;Functionalized Bispecific Nanobody as a Bispecific Antibody Mimic for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are next&#8208;generation therapeutics for complex cancer treatment. Herein, we developed a dual&#8208;targeting non&#8208;IgG format of bsAbs by using a bispecific nanobody (bsNb) that can simultaneously target EGFR and HER2 on tumor cells. Site&#8208;specific modification of the anti&#8208;EGFR&#8208;HER2 bsNb was conducted using the rhamnose (Rha) hapten via sortase A&#8208;mediated ligation to reconstitute the missing crystallizable fragment (Fc) effector biological functions. Functionally similar to bsAbs, bsNb&#8208;Rha conjugates retained dual&#8208;targeting activity and exerted potent anticancer effects via the Fc&#8208;domain&#8208;mediated engagement of endogenous anti&#8208;Rha antibodies. Further, an optimized bsNb&#8208;Rha conjugate exhibited markedly improved pharmacokinetics and efficient inhibitory effects against xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Our strategy provides a general and cost&#8208;effective platform to generate a new bsAb format for cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Production of L&#8208;Homophenylalanine by Enzymatic&#8208;Chemical Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A route involving both enzymatic and spontaneous chemical reactions was designed for the synthesis of L&#8208;homophenylalanine from inexpensive building blocks. One enzyme in the cascade, EcQOR, was identified as the first ene reductase to catalyze the reduction of an unsaturated aromatic keto acid. This study shows the potential of introducing spontaneous chemical reactions into enzymatic cascades for the synthesis of valuable chemicals.







Abstract
L&#8208;Homophenylalanine (L&#8208;HPA) is a vital building block for the synthesis of numerous chiral drugs. However, the high cost of starting materials limits the industrial production of L&#8208;HPA. In this study, an enzymatic&#8208;spontaneous chemical cascade route for L&#8208;HPA production was designed based on retrosynthetic analysis. This route, using simple benzaldehyde and pyruvate as starting materials, is extremely cost&#8208;effective. The enzymes were screened and further assembled in E.&#8197;coli, and TipheDH was identified as the rate&#8208;limiting enzyme. Therefore, TipheDH was engineered to improve its specific activity (by 82&#8201;%) and expression level (by 254&#8201;%), thus generating the best strain (W14). W14 exhibited the optimum enzyme activity ratio (1.7&#8201;:&#8201;1.1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1.8) and demonstrated production of 100.9&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 of L&#8208;HPA (with 94&#8201;% conversion, &gt;99&#8201;% ee) in a 5&#8208;L reactor. This route effectively exploits the power of cascades and offers insight into avenues for synthesizing other valuable chemicals from inexpensive building blocks.

         <title>Biodegradable Ca2+ Nanomodulators Activate Pyroptosis through Mitochondrial Ca2+ Overload for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biodegradable Ca2+ nanomodulators (CaNMs) that can activate pyroptosis for cancer immunotherapy are reported. The CaNMs decompose under low pH to release Ca2+ and curcumin (CUR), leading to a sudden surge in mitochondrial Ca2+ ions. This Ca2+ overload triggers an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the release of cytochrome&#8197;C, activation of caspase&#8208;3, and cleavage of GSDME, causing cell bubbling and pyrolysis.







Abstract
Pyroptosis provides a new direction and broad prospects for cancer immunotherapy. However, the development of a nanoplatform as a pyroptosis inducer is limited, and the discovery of a new type of nano&#8208;pyroptosis inducer for cancer immunotherapy is still imminent. Herein, biodegradable Ca2+ nanomodulators (CaNMs) are prepared as pyroptosis inducers for cancer immunotherapy via mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. The obtained CaNMs can decompose under low pH to release Ca2+ and curcumin, leading to a sudden surge in mitochondrial Ca2+ ions, eventually resulting in pyroptosis. We not only confirm the occurrence of mitochondrial Ca2+ overload&#8208;triggered pyroptosis for the first time but also reveal the robust immune responses via CaNMs, along with remarkably suppressing tumor proliferation and lung metastasis. This work will provide new strategies and inspiration for pyroptosis&#8208;mediated cancer treatments, greatly contributing to the further development of Ca2+ nanomodulators.

An unprecedented stereodivergent hydroalkylation of racemic allylic alcohols and racemic ketimine esters enabled by dual Cu/Ru relay catalysis has been developed. Merging the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric borrowing&#8208;hydrogen reaction with a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition into a one&#8208;pot procedure provided a route to highly functionalized &#948;&#8208;hydroxyesters bearing 1,4&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
An unprecedented hydroalkylation of racemic allylic alcohols and racemic ketimine esters enabled by Cu/Ru relay catalysis has been developed via merging the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric borrowing&#8208;hydrogen reaction with a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition in a one&#8208;pot procedure. The current method enables the efficient preparation of highly functionalized &#948;&#8208;hydroxyesters bearing 1,4&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters in good yields with high levels of diastereoselectivity and excellent enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions. The full complement of the four stereoisomers of hydroalkylation products could be readily accessed by orthogonal permutations of two chiral metal catalysts. The current work highlights the power of relay catalysis for the stereodivergent construction of 1,4&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters that were otherwise inaccessible.

Merging the ruthenium-catalyzed asymmetric borrowing-hydrogen reaction with a copper-catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition into a one-pot procedure provided a route to highly functionalized &#948;-hydroxyesters bearing 1,4-nonadjacent stereocenters in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries Using a Urea&#8208;Based Electrolyte with Kinetically Favorable One&#8208;Electron Li2O2 Oxidation Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new electrolyte solvent&#8212;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylurea (TMU) is proposed for lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs). Benefiting from its strong Li+&#8208;solvating ability and the absence of &#945;&#8208;hydrogen atoms, a kinetically favorable one&#8208;electron Li2O2 oxidation pathway can occur in the charge process, and the hydrogen extraction side reactions can be effectively suppressed. Consequently, the TMU&#8208;based LOBs exhibit a low charge overpotential and a long cycle life.







Abstract
Glymes are the most widely used electrolyte solvents in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs) due to their relatively high stability. However, their associated LOBs have long been plagued by large charge overpotential, which is closely related to the sluggish two&#8208;electron Li2O2 oxidation mechanism. Here, we report a new electrolyte solvent&#8212;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylurea (TMU) for LOBs with high performance and an alternative mechanism, where a kinetically favorable one&#8208;electron Li2O2 oxidation pathway can happen in the urea electrolyte system, thus leading to a much lower charge overpotential (&#8776;0.51&#8197;V) compared to the tetraglyme&#8208;based LOBs (&#8776;1.27&#8197;V). Besides, TMU also exhibits good stability since it does not contain any &#945;&#8208;hydrogen atoms that are vulnerable to be attacked by superoxide species, thus suppressing the hydrogen abstraction side reactions. Consequently, the TMU&#8208;based LOBs can stably work for more than 135&#8197;cycles, which is four times that of the tetraglyme&#8208;based LOBs (&#8776;28&#8197;cycles).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient polyelectrolyte hole&#8208;transport layer was explored for 2D perovskite solar cells by using compatible butylamine cation, as reported by Jianyu Yuan and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202205111). The tailored polyelectrolyte has an anchoring effect and acts as the buried passivator for 2D perovskites, which can improve 2D perovskite phase alignment and interfacial charge transfer efficiency, and finally enable high&#8208;efficiency and large&#8208;area 2D perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Selenoviologen&#8208;Appendant Metallacycles with Highly Stable Radical Cations and Long&#8208;Lived Charge Separation States for Electrochromism and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two coordinated metallacycles (rhomboid for M1 , hexagonal for M2 ) with selenoviologens (SeV  2+  ) pendants were synthesized via coordination&#8208;driven hierarchical self&#8208;assembly. M1/M2  with rigid and discrete metallacyclic cores showed tunable optoelectronic properties due to strong p&#8208;p stacking and push&#8208;pull electron structures. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) revealed that the formation of macrocyclic structure can not only enhance the stability of radical cation, but also improve the efficiency of intramolecular charge transfer and produce a long&#8208;lived charge separation state. The electrochromic performances of M1 / M2 &#8208;based devices were exhibited to show decent radical stabilization. By using M1 / M2 as the photocatalyst, the improved catalytic efficiency (&gt; 80%) of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reactions was achieved due to the highly stable radical cations and long&#8208;lived charge separation states  ,  which were also confirmed by fs&#8208;TA.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of new  D  2h  symmetric porphyrins (  MDA4  ,  MTA4  , and  MDA8  ) with donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor structures have been synthesized as the hole&#8208;transporting materials for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The novel porphyrin molecules feature a  D  2h  symmetrically substituted Zn(II) porphyrin core and two kinds of donor systems (diarylamine (DAA) and triarylamine (TAA)), which can regulate energy level, increase thermal stability, solubility, and hydrophobicity via long alkoxyl chains. PSC devices based on  MDA4  as the HTM showed impressive power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.67% under AM1.5G solar illumination. Notably, the device was sent for certification, and a PCE of 22.19% was reported, representing the highest PCE from porphyrin&#8208;based HTMs. Furthermore, the  MDA4  &#8208;based PSCs showed excellent thermal stability under 60 &#176;C and RH 60% and preserved 88% of initial performance after 360 hours.

         <title>Repetitive Thiazolidine Deprotection Using a Thioester&#8208;Compatible Aldehyde Scavenger for One&#8208;Pot Multiple Peptide Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategies for one&#8208;pot peptide ligation enable chemists to access synthetic proteins at a high yield in a short time. Herein, we report a novel one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;segments ligation strategy using N&#8208;terminal thiazolidine (Thz) peptide and a newly designed formaldehyde scavenger. Among the designed 2&#8208;aminobenzamide&#8208;based aldehyde scavengers, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylbenzohydrazide (AMDBH) can remarkably convert Thz into unprotected cysteine at pH 4.0. Furthermore, AMDBH degrades Thz at a considerably low rate at pH 7.5, and thioester degradation caused by this scavenger is negligible. As a result, we have developed an efficient one&#8208;pot peptide ligation strategy by simply repetitively changing the pH with AMDBH. Finally, we synthesize mono&#8208;ubiquitinated histone H2A.Z (209 amino acids) via AMDBH&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot four&#8208;segment peptide ligation in good yield.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Strategies for one-pot peptide ligation enable chemists to access synthetic proteins at a high yield in a short time. Herein, we report a novel one-pot multi-segments ligation strategy using N-terminal thiazolidine (Thz) peptide and a newly designed formaldehyde scavenger. Among the designed 2-aminobenzamide-based aldehyde scavengers, 2-amino-5-methoxy-N&#8217;,N&#8217;-dimethylbenzohydrazide (AMDBH) can remarkably convert Thz into unprotected cysteine at pH 4.0. Furthermore, AMDBH degrades Thz at a considerably low rate at pH 7.5, and thioester degradation caused by this scavenger is negligible. As a result, we have developed an efficient one-pot peptide ligation strategy by simply repetitively changing the pH with AMDBH. Finally, we synthesize mono-ubiquitinated histone H2A.Z (209 amino acids) via AMDBH-mediated one-pot four-segment peptide ligation in good yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the facile synthesis and 3D printing of a series of triblock copolymers consisting of soft and hard blocks and demonstrate that alkene pendant groups of the hard block can be covalently modified. The polymers are prepared using a salenCo(III)TFA/PPNTFA binary catalyst system and 1,2&#8208;propanediol as a chain transfer agent, providing an efficient one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step strategy to tailor polymer thermal and mechanical properties. Thixotropic inks suitable for direct ink write printing were formulated by dissolving the block copolymers in organic solvent and dispersing NaCl particles. After printing, porous structures were produced by removing solvent and NaCl with water to give printed structures with surfaces that could be modified via UV&#8208;initiated thiol&#8208;ene click reactions. Alternatively, a tetra&#8208;thiol could be incorporated into the ink and used for cross&#8208;linking to give objects with high solvent resistance and selective degradability.</dc:description>

         <title>Creating Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Defective Boron Carbon Nitride for Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;controlled boron carbon nitride (BCN) is synthesized with electron&#8208;deficient B atoms and electron&#8208;rich N atoms in defects, forming frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) to promote the electrocatalytic N2 reduction to ammonia.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) on metal&#8208;free catalysts is an attractive alternative to the industrial Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts still suffer from low Faraday efficiencies and low ammonia yields. Herein, we present a molecular design strategy to develop a defective boron carbon nitride (BCN) catalyst with the abundant unsaturated B and N atoms as Lewis acid and base sites, which upgrades the catalyst from a single &#8220;Lewis acid catalysis&#8221; to &#8220;frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) catalysis.&#8221; 14N2/15N2 exchange experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that FLPs can adsorb an N2 molecule to form a six&#8208;membered ring intermediate, which enables the cleavage of N2 via a pull&#8211;pull effect, thereby significantly reducing the energy barrier to &#8722;0.28&#8197;eV. Impressively, BCN achieves a high Faraday efficiency of 18.9&#8201;%, an ammonia yield of 20.9&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat., and long&#8208;term durability.

         <title>Structures of the Most Twisted Thioamide and Selenoamide: Effect of Higher Chalcogens of Twisted Amides on N&#8722;C(X) Resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first higher chalcogen derivatives of non&#8208;planar twisted amides are reported. The study provides the first experimental evidence on the effect of chalcogen isologues on the structural and electronic properties of the non&#8208;planar amide N&#8722;C(X) linkage with implications in broad areas of chemistry that utilize amide bonds through the modification of nN&#8594;&#960;*C=O resonance and amide bond geometry.







Abstract
Amide bond replacement with planar isosteric chalcogen analogues has an important implication for the properties of the N&#8722;C(X) linkage in structural chemistry, biochemistry and organic synthesis. Herein, we report the first higher chalcogen derivatives of non&#8208;planar twisted amides. The synthesis of twisted thioamide in a versatile system has been accomplished by direct thionation without cleavage of the &#963; N&#8722;C bond. The synthesis of twisted selenoamide has been accomplished by selenation with Woollins&#8217; reagent. The structures of higher chalcogen analogues of non&#8208;planar amides were unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Reactivity studies were conducted to determine the effect of isologous N&#8722;C(O) to N&#8722;C(X) replacement on the properties of the amide linkage. Computational studies were employed to evaluate structural and energetic parameters of amide bond alteration in higher chalcogen amides. The study provides the first experimental evidence on the effect of chalcogen isologues on the structural and electronic properties of the non&#8208;planar amide N&#8722;C(X) linkage.

         <title>Dearomative Ring Expansion of Polycyclic Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A missing link between dearomative cyclopropanation and ring expansion of polycyclic (hetero)arenes has been established by utilizing an arenophile&#8208;based strategy. This two&#8208;step protocol enables the direct conversion of aromatic compounds into (aza)benzocycloheptatrienes, which are important structural motifs in natural products and biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Benzocycloheptenes constitute a common structural motif embedded in many natural products and biologically active compounds. Herein, we report their concise preparation from non&#8208;activated polycyclic arenes using a two&#8208;step sequence involving dearomative [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with arenophile in combination with palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation, followed by cycloreversion&#8208;initiated ring expansion. The described strategy provides a working alternative to the Buchner reaction, which is limited to monocyclic arenes. Overall, this methylene&#8208;insertion molecular editing approach enables rapid and direct conversion of simple (hetero)arenes into a range of substituted (aza)benzocycloheptatrienes, which can undergo a myriad of downstream functionalizations.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Directed Formation of B&#8722;N Bonds for BN&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Aromatic Multiple Resonance Emitters with Narrowband Emission</title>

         <dc:description>
A new paradigm of easy&#8208;to&#8208;access multiple resonance (MR) emitter is constructed by simplifying multiborylation through amine&#8208;directed formation of B&#8722;N bonds, while introducing an additional para&#8208;positioned N atom to trigger the MR effect. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecules, m[B&#8208;N]N1 and m[B&#8208;N]N2, exhibit impressive maximum EQE values of 36.0&#8201;% and 33.4&#8201;%, with narrowband emissions at 480 and 486&#8197;nm, and FWHMs of only 26 and 32&#8197;nm, respectively.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable multiple resonance (MR) optoelectronic properties of organic nanographenes with boron and nitrogen atoms disposed para to each other, the synthetic procedures are sophisticated with low yields and the molecular skeletons are limited. Here, a new paradigm of easy&#8208;to&#8208;access MR emitter is constructed by simplifying the multiborylation through amine&#8208;directed formation of B&#8722;N bonds while introducing an additional para&#8208;positioned nitrogen atom to trigger the MR effect. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecules exhibit narrowband emissions at 480 and 490&#8197;nm, with full width at half maxima (FWHMs) of only 29 and 34&#8197;nm. The devices based on them showed external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of &gt;33.0&#8201;%, which remained above 24.0&#8201;% even at a high brightness of 5000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This is the first example of MR emitters with a B&#8722;N covalent bond, not only decreasing the synthesis difficulty but also increasing the diversity of MR skeletons for emerging new optoelectronic properties.

The proof-of-concept molecules, &lt;b&gt;m[B-N]N1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;m[B-N]N2&lt;/b&gt;, exhibit impressive maximum EQE values of 36.0&#8201;% and 33.4&#8201;%, with narrowband emissions at 480 and 486&#8197;nm, and FWHMs of only 26 and 32&#8197;nm, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the remarkable multiple resonance (MR) optoelectronic properties of organic nanographenes with boron and nitrogen atoms disposed &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt; to each other, the synthetic procedures are sophisticated with low yields and the molecular skeletons are limited. Here, a new paradigm of easy-to-access MR emitter is constructed by simplifying the multiborylation through amine-directed formation of B&#8722;N bonds while introducing an additional &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-positioned nitrogen atom to trigger the MR effect. The proof-of-concept molecules exhibit narrowband emissions at 480 and 490&#8197;nm, with full width at half maxima (FWHMs) of only 29 and 34&#8197;nm. The devices based on them showed external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of &amp;gt;33.0&#8201;%, which remained above 24.0&#8201;% even at a high brightness of 5000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This is the first example of MR emitters with a B&#8722;N covalent bond, not only decreasing the synthesis difficulty but also increasing the diversity of MR skeletons for emerging new optoelectronic properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Monohydrosilane: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monohydrosilanes, which bear a Si&#8722;H bond, have been widely leveraged as chiral reagents for alcohol resolution, chiral auxiliaries, mechanistic probes, as well as potential optoelectronic materials. This Minireview comprehensively summarizes the synthesis and synthetic applications of silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes, particularly the advances in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis.







Abstract
Optically active organosilanes have been demonstrated to be versatile chiral reagents in synthetic chemistry since the early seminal contributions by Sommer and Corriu. Among these silicon&#8208;containing chiral architectures, monohydrosilanes, which bear a Si&#8722;H bond, hold a unique position because of their facile transformations through stereospecific Si&#8211;carbon or Si&#8211;heteroatom bond&#8208;formation reactions. In addition, those compounds have also been leveraged as chiral reagents for alcohol resolution, chiral auxiliaries, mechanistic probes, as well as potential optoelectronic materials. This Minireview comprehensively summarizes the synthesis and synthetic applications of silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes, particularly the advances in the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of this class of functional molecules.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroaryloxy&#8208; and Hydroalkoxycarbonylation of Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly enantioselective inter&#8208; and intramolecular Ni&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkoxycarbonylation yields various enantioenriched polysubstituted cyclopropanecarboxylic derivatives with quaternary carbon stereocenters.







Abstract
The asymmetric Reppe carbonylation reactions provide a straightforward access to &#945;&#8208;chiral carbonyl compounds. The reported paradigms predominantly adopted precious palladium as the catalyst. Here we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carbonylation of cyclopropenes with phenyl formate and CO/ROH, respectively. This asymmetrical synthetic protocol features high atom economy, good functional group tolerance, which rapidly constructs polysubstituted cyclopropanecarboxylic derivatives with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by facile conversion of the chiral products into bioactive molecules such as (&#8722;)&#8208;Tranylcypromine and (&#8722;)&#8208;Lemborexant.

         <title>A 4&#8208;Arm Small Molecule Acceptor with High Photovoltaic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating the backbone of small molecule acceptors (SMAs) is of particular importance in developing efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). The common design is constructing  2  &#8208;arm SMAs with  linear or curved  backbones. Herein, we report an acceptor 4A&#8208;DFIC with a 4&#8208;arm backbone unexpectedly  generated in the reaction of an electron&#8208;rich aromatic diamine and hexaketocyclohexane.  Single  &#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates the rigid and twisted molecular plane and the effective molecular stacking of 4A&#8208;DFIC in solid state. 4A&#8208;DFIC shows a low bandgap of 1.40 eV and excellent light&#8208;harvesting capability from visible to near&#8208;infrared region. Binary and ternary OSCs based on 4A&#8208;DFIC gave power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 15.76% and 18.60% (certified 18.1%), respectively, which are the  highest  PCEs for multi&#8208;arm SMA&#8208;based OSCs to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Precursor Engineering to Reduce Processing Temperature of ZnO Films for Flexible Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sol&#8208;gel&#8208;derived ZnO is one of the most widely used electron&#8208;transporting layers in inverted organic solar cells. The sol&#8208;gel ZnO precursor consists of zinc acetate dehydrate (ZAH) and ethanolamine dissolved in 2&#8208;methoxyethanol, where  ethanolamine chelates with ZAH, which helps ZAH dissolve in the 2&#8208;methoxyethanol  . However, an annealing temperature above 120 &#176;C is required to convert the complexes into ZnO.  High temperatures are incompatible with flexible plastic substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate  .  In this work  , we report an amine&#8208;free recipe consisting of ZAH in methanol to prepare ZnO films. The complex formed in the amine&#8208;free precursor solution is methanol&#8208;solvated ZAH, which is simpler than that of the amine&#8208;containing precursor solution. The temperature required for converting the precursor complex into ZnO was reduced to 90 &#176;C for the amine&#8208;free recipe. Low&#8208;temperature&#8208;processed ZnO can function efficiently as an electron&#8208;transporting layer in both rigid and flexible inverted nonfullerene solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Desymmetric Cyanosilylation of Acyclic 1,3&#8208;Diketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective construction of vicinal stereocenters from easily available starting materials is a challenging task. Here, we report that a bifunctional catalyst prepared from dibutylmagnesium and a pipecolinol&#8208;derived tetradentate ligand can enable an asymmetric cyanosilylation of 1,3&#8208;diketones to forge a pair of neighboring and acyclic tetrasubstituted carbons. The high stereoselectivity results from the rigid conformation of the diketone in the catalyst pocket, where the Lewis acidic magnesium center, together with the free hydroxyl group as a putative hydrogen bond donor, bind with both carbonyls. Consequently, stereochemically well&#8208;defined cyanohydrin silyl ethers with a diverse collection of substituents were prepared. Their rapid derivatization to molecules of higher complexity, such as heterocycles, triols, and fused rings, were also demonstrated.</dc:description>

The high stereoselectivity results from the rigid conformation of the diketone in the catalyst pocket, where the Lewis acidic magnesium center, together with the free hydroxyl group as a putative hydrogen bond donor, bind with both carbonyls. Consequently, stereochemically well-defined cyanohydrin silyl ethers with a diverse collection of substituents were prepared. Their rapid derivatization to molecules of higher complexity, such as heterocycles, triols, and fused rings, were also demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The&#160;Bifunctional Silyl Reagent Me2(CH2Cl)SiCF3 Enabled Highly Enantioselective Ketone Trifluoromethylation and Related Tandem Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the invention of bifunctional trifluoromethylsilyl reagents for selective trifluoromethylation. Newly developed reagent, Me  2  (CH  2  Cl)SiCF  3  , allows highly enantioselective trifluoromethylation of ketones with unprecedentedly excellent enantioselectivity and broad scope. Notably, taking advantage of the chloromethyl group, a tandem synthesis of chiral trifluoromethylated oxasilacyclopentanes is developed, paving way to &#945;&#8208;CF  3  tertiary alcohols with vicinal tertiary or quaternary stereocenters. Theoretical studies revealed the important role of nonclassical C&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F&#8722;C interactions in stabilizing the transition state, and that the presence of chlorine atom enhances such interactions for better enantiofacial control.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aryl Acrylamides via Lewis Base Mediated Aryl/Hydrogen Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl acrylamides leveraging polar  S  &#8208;to  &#8208;C  aryl migrations induced by a Lewis basic organocatalyst. In contrast to previously reported radical aryl migrations of sulfonyl acrylimides, this polar process enables subsequent elimination, ultimately leading to a formal aryl/hydrogen exchange including SO  2  extrusion. This reaction is selective for electron&#8208;deficient aromatic groups while tolerating a variety of substituents on nitrogen and in &#946;&#8208;position, and delivers useful building blocks for further transformations, including cycloaddition and cyclisation reactions. The mechanism was investigated in detail using quantum chemical calculations, which revealed the Lewis base to be unexpectedly involved in several decisive steps.</dc:description>

Time resolved fluorescence including global analysis showed contribution of three linked components to the overall dynamics of the excited state. Electrochemical and photonic properties of this heterogeneous material facilitated photopolymerization in a photo&#8208;ATRP setup where either CuBr2/TPMA, FeBr3/Br&#8208;&#160;or a metal free reaction setup activated controlled polymerization.&#160;&#160;Chain extension experiments worked in all three cases showing end group fidelity for activation of controlled block copolymerization using&#160;MMA&#160;and styrene as monomers.

         <title>Biomimetic Total Synthesis and Investigation of the Non&#8209;Enzymatic Chemistry of Oxazinin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first total synthesis of an antimycobacterial natural product oxazinin A that takes advantage of a multi&#8208;component cascade reaction of anthranilic acid and a precursor polyketide containing an aldehyde. The route utilized for the synthesis of the pseudodimeric oxazinin A validates a previously proposed biosynthetic mechanism, invoking a non&#8208;enzymatic pathway to the complex molecule. We found a 76:10:9:5 ratio of oxazinin diastereomers from the synthetic cascade, which is an identical match to that found in the fermentation media from the fungus  Eurotiomycetes  110162. Further investigation of the non&#8208;enzymatic formation of oxazinin A using  1  H&#8208;  15  N HMBC NMR spectroscopy allowed for a plausible determination of the stepwise mechanism. The developed route is highly amenable for the synthesis of diverse sets of analogs around the oxazinin scaffold to study structure&#8722;activity relationships (SAR).</dc:description>

         <title>Sp&#8208;hybridized Nitrogen as New Anchoring Sites of Iron Single Atoms to Boost the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon supported single&#8208;atom catalysts with metal&#8208;N  x  configuration are considered as one of the most efficient catalysts towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and expected to serve as promising alternatives to Pt/C. However, most of the metal&#8208;N  x  active sites are composed by pyridinic N ligands at the defect locations of graphene&#8208;like supports. Here, we employ graphdiyne (GDY) as a new carbon substrate to synthesize an iron (Fe) single atom catalyst (denoted as Fe&#8208;N&#8208;GDY), showing excellent catalytic performance. Benefitting from the abundant acetylenic bonds in GDY support, it is favorable for the formation of sp&#8208;N anchored metal atoms without forming defects. The Fe atoms coordinate with sp&#8208;N and spontaneously adsorb OH, which regulate the electronic structure of Fe atoms. Systematic characterizations as well as theoretical analyses confirm that the coordination of sp&#8208;N and OH optimize the adsorption energy of ORR intermediates on the active sites by reducing electron local density of Fe atoms, which accelerates the reaction kinetics and promotes the ORR activity of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;GDY. Furthermore, the practical application of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;GDY is corroborated by its high power density and long&#8208;term performance via assembling zinc&#8208;air battery.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Microenvironments tailored by multifunctional secondary coordination sphere groups can enhance catalytic performance at primary metal active sites in natural systems. Here, we capture this biological concept in synthetic systems by developing a family of iron porphyrins decorated with imidazolium (im) pendants for the electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR), which promotes multiple synergistic effects to enhance CO  2  RR and enables the disentangling of second&#8208;sphere contributions that stem from each type of interaction.  Fe&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;im(H)  , which poises imidazolium units featuring both positive charge and hydrogen&#8208;bond capabilities proximal to the active iron center, increases CO  2  binding affinity by 25&#8208;fold and CO  2  RR activity by 2,000&#8208;fold relative to the parent Fe tetraphenylporphyrin (  Fe&#8208;TPP  ). Comparison with mono&#8208;functional analogs reveals that through&#8208;space charge effects have a greater impact on catalytic CO  2  RR performance compared to hydrogen bonding in this context.</dc:description>

         <title>Heck Reaction of N&#8208;Heteroaryl Halides for the Concise Synthesis of Chiral &#945;&#8208;Heteroaryl&#8208;substituted Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Heck reaction between  N  &#8208;heteroaryl halides and heterocyclic alkenes provides a convenient approach to biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl functionalized heterocycles, yet reactions of this type have been challenging due to strong  N  &#8208;heteroaryl coordination to palladium metal, which causes catalyst poisoning. In this report, an efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction between  N  &#8208;heteroaryl halides and heterocyclic olefins is established, leading to a variety of &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl substituted heterocycles. The method features an unprecedented broad substrate scope and excellent functional group compatibility. The employment of a sterically bulky P, P=O ligand containing an anthryl moiety is crucial for this transformation due to the coordinative unsaturation facilitated by its steric bulkiness. The asymmetric variant of the Heck reaction is achieved with (  S  )&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS via a cationic palladium pathway, which has enabled an efficient asymmetric synthesis of (  S  )&#8208;nicotine and its analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>From Copper to Basic Copper Carbonate: A Reversible Conversion Cathode in Aqueous Anion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly reversible electrochemical conversion of commercial bulk copper metal to form basic copper carbonate, Cu2CO3(OH)2, from a saturated aqueous electrolyte comprising 4.5&#8201;m K2CO3 and 9&#8201;m KOH, demonstrating high capacity, fast rate capability, and relatively stable cycle life is reported. The salt electrode consisting of Cu, K2CO3, and KOH renders this anion&#8208;hosting electrode a cathode for rocking&#8208;chair batteries.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries that use anions and cations as charge carriers represent a promising energy&#8208;storage technology. However, an uncharted area is to explore transition metals as electrodes to host carbonate in conversion reactions. Here we report the reversible conversion reaction from copper to Cu2CO3(OH)2, where the copper electrode comprising K2CO3 and KOH solid is self&#8208;sufficient with anion&#8208;charge carriers. This electrode dissociates and associates K+ ions during battery charge and discharge. The copper active mass and the anion&#8208;bearing cathode exhibit a reversible capacity of 664&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 299&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, and relatively stable cycling in a saturated mixture electrolyte of K2CO3 and KOH. The results open an avenue to use carbonate as a charge carrier for batteries to serve for the consumption and storage of CO2.

         <title>Mild Acidosis&#8208;Directed Signal Amplification in Tumor Microenvironment via Spatioselective Recruitment of DNA Amplifiers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;based strategy is developed for spatially&#8208;selective amplification of acidic signals in the extracellular milieu of tumors. Amplified imaging of the tumor microenvironment with improved sensitivity was achieved by acidity&#8208;responsive engineering of the cell surface with DNA receptors for controlled recruitment of fluorescent amplifiers.







Abstract
DNA biotechnology offers intriguing opportunities for amplification&#8208;based sensitive detection. However, spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled manipulation of signal amplification for in situ imaging of the tumor microenvironment remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate a DNA&#8208;based strategy that can spatial&#8208;selectively amplify the acidic signal in the extracellular milieu of the tumor to achieve specific imaging with improved sensitivity. The strategy, termed mild acidosis&#8208;targeted amplification (MAT&#8208;amp), leverages the specific acidic microenvironment to engineer tumor cells with artificial DNA receptors through a pH (low) insertion peptide, which permits controlled recruitment of fluorescent amplifiers via a hybridization chain reaction. The acidosis&#8208;responsive amplification cascade enables significant fluorescence enhancement in tumors with a reduced background signal in normal tissues, leading to improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. These results highlight the utility of MAT&#8208;amp for in situ imaging of the microenvironment characterized by pH disequilibrium.

         <title>&#8220;Rim&#8208;Differentiated&#8221; Pillar[6]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a dimeric silver trifluoroacetate template, has facilitated a &#8220;rim&#8208;differentiated&#8221; pillar[6]arene to be isolated successfully from a mixture containing eight constitutional isomers. This macrocycle exhibits interesting conformational adaptation toward guest molecules in the solid state.







Abstract
A &#8220;rim&#8208;differentiated&#8221; pillar[6]arene (RD&#8208;P[6]) was obtained successfully, with the assistance of a dimeric silver trifluoroacetate template, among eight different constitutional isomers in a direct and regioselective manner. The solid&#8208;state conformation of this macrocycle could switch from the 1,3,5&#8208;alternate to a truly rim&#8208;differentiated one upon guest inclusion. This highly symmetric RD&#8208;P[6] not only hosts metal&#8208;containing molecules inside its cavity, but also can form a pillar[6]arene&#8208;C60 adduct through co&#8208;crystallization on account of donor&#8208;acceptor interactions. The development of synthetic strategies to desymmetrize pillararenes offers new opportunities for engineering complex molecular architectures and organic electronic materials.

         <title>S,O&#8208;Ligand Promoted meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation of Anisole Derivatives via Palladium/Norbornene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient meta&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylation of aryl ethers has been realized by a new catalytic system based on palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) and an S,O&#8208;ligand. The reaction proceeds with a broad range of aryl ethers. For the first time, unsymmetrical meta&#8208;diarylation of aryl ethers was accomplished using a novel norbornene. The isolation of palladium intermediates provides insight to the mechanism.







Abstract
Reversing the conventional site&#8208;selectivity of C&#8722;H activation processes provides new retrosynthetic disconnections to otherwise unreactive bonds. Here, we report a new catalytic system based on palladium/norbornene and an S,O&#8208;ligand for the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of aryl ethers that significantly outperforms previously reported systems. We demonstrate the unique ability of this system to employ alkoxyarene substrates bearing electron donating and withdrawing substituents. Additionally, ortho&#8208;substituted aryl ethers are well tolerated, overcoming the &#8220;ortho constraint&#8221;, which is the necessity to have a meta&#8208;substituent on the alkoxyarene to achieve high reaction efficiency, by enlisting novel norbornene mediators. Remarkably, for the first time the monoarylation of alkoxyarenes is achieved efficiently enabling the subsequent introduction of a second, different aryl coupling partner to rapidly furnish unsymmetrical terphenyls. Further insight into the reaction mechanism was achieved by isolation and characterization of some Pd&#8208;complexes&#8212;before and after meta C&#8722;H activation&#8212;prior to evaluation of their respective catalytic activities.

         <title>Stabilization of Cu+ via Strong Electronic Interaction for Selective and Stable CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong electronic interactions between hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) and Cu2O protect the Cu&#8722;O bonds against electron attack through the transfer of accumulated electrons from Cu2O to h&#8208;BN. This effect stabilizes the active Cu+ species during CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Copper oxide&#8208;based materials effectively electrocatalyze carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR). To comprehend their role and achieve high CO2RR activity, Cu+ in copper oxides must be stabilized. As an electrocatalyst, Cu2O nanoparticles were decorated with hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanosheets to stabilize Cu+. The C2H4/CO ratio increased 1.62&#8208;fold in the CO2RR with Cu2O&#8722;BN compared to that with Cu2O. Experimental and theoretical studies confirmed strong electronic interactions between the two components in Cu2O&#8722;BN, which strengthens the Cu&#8722;O bonds. Electrophilic h&#8208;BN receives partial electron density from Cu2O, protecting the Cu&#8722;O bonds from electron attack during the CO2RR and stabilizing the Cu+ species during long&#8208;term electrolysis. The well&#8208;retained Cu+ species enhanced the C2 product selectivity and improved the stability of Cu2O&#8722;BN. This work offers new insight into the metal&#8208;valence&#8208;state&#8208;dependent selectivity of catalysts, enabling the design of advanced catalysts.

         <title>Catalytic Atroposelective Electrophilic Amination of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atroposelective electrophilic amination of indoles catalyzed by a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) is reported. The reaction proceeds by asymmetric 1,6&#8208;addition to p&#8208;quinone diimines to deliver atropochiral N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;3&#8208;arylaminoindoles in good yields and with excellent ee values.







Abstract
Reported here is the first catalytic atroposelective electrophilic amination of indoles, which delivers functionalized atropochiral N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;3&#8208;arylaminoindoles with excellent optical purity. This reaction was furnished by 1,6&#8208;nucleophilic addition to p&#8208;quinone diimines. Control experiments suggest an ionic mechanism that differs from the radical addition pathway commonly proposed for 1,6&#8208;addition to quinones. The origin of 1,6&#8208;addition selectivity was investigated through computational studies. Preliminary studies show that the obtained 3&#8208;aminoindoles atropisomers exhibit anticancer activities. This method is valuable with respect to enlarging the toolbox for atropochiral amine derivatives.

         <title>Bipolar Magnetic Molecules for Spin&#8208;Polarized Electric Current in Molecular Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method to manipulate electron spin orientation in single molecule devices by electrical gating is reported. The realization of such a function is based on a special class of molecules, named bipolar magnetic molecules (BMMs), which are characterized by their unique energy level arrangement, i.e. HOMO and LUMO come from two different spin channels.







Abstract
Electrical control of spin transport at single molecule level is highly desired for molecular nanospintronics. By exploiting magnetic bistability of spin crossover complexes, the magnitude of spin polarization can be modulated. However, efficiently controlling the direction of spin polarization at single molecule level is still challenging. Here, we propose a general method to flip the transport electron spin simply by electrical gating in single molecule devices based on bipolar magnetic molecules (BMMs), of which the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) come from different spin channels. Thus, when the device's Fermi level is reversibly adjusted approaching either HOMO or LUMO by changing the polarity of the applied voltage gate, a 100&#8201;% spin polarized current with switchable spin direction is achievable. The proposed method is verified by the calculated electronic and transport properties of 9 potential transition metal coordination BMMs.

         <title>Sustainable Afterglow Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Emission Materials Generated Using Natural Phenolics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable organic afterglow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with long lifetime is a particularly attractive phenomenon but remains difficult to achieve. Here, we prepared sustainable afterglow RTP materials (GA@SA) with a lifetime up to 934.7&#8197;ms by embedding gallic acid (GA) within a Ca2+&#8208;crosslinked sodium alginate (SA) matrix.







Abstract
Long&#8208;lived afterglow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from natural phenolics has seldom been reported yet this is essential for the development of sustainable afterglow RTP materials. With this research, we have prepared sustainable afterglow RTP materials (GA@SA) with a lifetime of up to &#8776;934.7&#8197;ms by embedding gallic acid (GA) within a Ca2+&#8208;crosslinked sodium alginate (SA) matrix. Theoretical simulations indicate that the restricted carbonyl moieties of the GA and H&#8208;type aggregates of GA in a SA matrix promoted the spin orbit coupling (SOC) of GA and induced afterglow emission. Moreover, afterglow RTP emission could be produced by embedding different types of natural phenolics such as, tannic acid, caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid into Ca2+&#8208;crosslinked networks of SA. As an illustration of potential applications, GA@SA was used to prepare anti&#8208;counterfeit afterglow clothing and paper. This work provides an innovative method for the activation of long&#8208;lived afterglow RTP from sustainable phenolics.

     alt="Sustainable Afterglow Room-Temperature Phosphorescence Emission Materials Generated Using Natural Phenolics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustainable organic afterglow room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with long lifetime is a particularly attractive phenomenon but remains difficult to achieve. Here, we prepared sustainable afterglow RTP materials (GA@SA) with a lifetime up to 934.7&#8197;ms by embedding gallic acid (GA) within a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-crosslinked sodium alginate (SA) matrix.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-lived afterglow room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from natural phenolics has seldom been reported yet this is essential for the development of sustainable afterglow RTP materials. With this research, we have prepared sustainable afterglow RTP materials (GA@SA) with a lifetime of up to &#8776;934.7&#8197;ms by embedding gallic acid (GA) within a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-crosslinked sodium alginate (SA) matrix. Theoretical simulations indicate that the restricted carbonyl moieties of the GA and H-type aggregates of GA in a SA matrix promoted the spin orbit coupling (SOC) of GA and induced afterglow emission. Moreover, afterglow RTP emission could be produced by embedding different types of natural phenolics such as, tannic acid, caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid into Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-crosslinked networks of SA. As an illustration of potential applications, GA@SA was used to prepare anti-counterfeit afterglow clothing and paper. This work provides an innovative method for the activation of long-lived afterglow RTP from sustainable phenolics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Four ketoreductases (KREDs) were identified for the enantioselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides. KRED311 and KRED349 catalyse the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides bearing a stereocentre at the C&#8722;O bond with opposite absolute configurations via chemoenzymatic cascades from thiophenols/thiols and &#945;&#8208;haloketones/alcohols. KRED253 and KRED384 catalyse the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides bearing a stereocentre at the C&#8722;S bond with opposite enantioselectivities by dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic &#945;&#8208;thioaldehydes.







Abstract
Chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides are an important class of organic compounds which find broad application in organic and pharmaceutical chemistry. Herein we describe the development of novel biocatalytic and chemoenzymatic methods for the enantioselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides by exploiting ketoreductase (KRED) enzymes. Four KREDs were discovered from a pool of 384 enzymes identified and isolated through a metagenomic approach. KRED311 and KRED349 catalysed the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides bearing a stereocentre at the C&#8722;O bond with opposite absolute configurations and excellent ee values by novel chemoenzymatic and biocatalytic&#8208;chemical&#8208;biocatalytic (bio&#8208;chem&#8208;bio) cascades starting from commercially available thiophenols/thiols and &#945;&#8208;haloketones/alcohols.

         <title>The Chemistry of Cu3N and Cu3PdN Nanocrystals
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;pure, colloidally stable Cu3N and Cu3PdN were obtained. The precursor conversion mechanism is elucidated; oleylamine is oxidized to a primary aldimine and the latter reacts further with oleylamine to a secondary aldimine, eliminating ammonia. Ammonia reacts with CuI to form Cu3N.







Abstract
The precursor conversion chemistry and surface chemistry of Cu3N and Cu3PdN nanocrystals are unknown or contested. Here, we first obtain phase&#8208;pure, colloidally stable nanocubes. Second, we elucidate the pathway by which copper(II) nitrate and oleylamine form Cu3N. We find that oleylamine is both a reductant and a nitrogen source. Oleylamine is oxidized by nitrate to a primary aldimine, which reacts further with excess oleylamine to a secondary aldimine, eliminating ammonia. Ammonia reacts with CuI to form Cu3N. Third, we investigated the surface chemistry and find a mixed ligand shell of aliphatic amines and carboxylates (formed in situ). While the carboxylates appear tightly bound, the amines are easily desorbed from the surface. Finally, we show that doping with palladium decreases the band gap and the material becomes semi&#8208;metallic. These results bring insight into the chemistry of metal nitrides and might help the development of other metal nitride nanocrystals.

         <title>Li&#8722;N Interaction Induced Deep Eutectic Gel Polymer Electrolyte for High Performance Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new Li&#8722;N interaction induced 1,2&#8208;dimethylimidazole (DMIm)&#8208;based deep eutectic gel polymer electrolyte is reported. The electron&#8208;donating DMIm dissociates LiTFSI well to form a deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE). The incorporation of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) further changes the coordination environment of the Li+ ions. This kind of gel polymer electrolyte exhibits high ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability and enables the excellent long&#8208;term cycling performance for Li/LFP cells.







Abstract
As emerging eutectic mixtures, deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) show unique properties for Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). However, the limited choice and inferior electrode compatibility hinder their further development in LMBs. Herein, we report a new 1,2&#8208;dimethylimidazole (DMIm)&#8208;based deep eutectic gel polymer electrolyte induced by Li&#8722;N interaction. We demonstrate that incorporating electron&#8208;withdrawing polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) polymer into the DMIm&#8208;based DEE changes the coordination environment of Li+ ions, leading to a high transference number of Li+ ions (0.65) and superior interface stability between the electrolyte and Li anode. The deep eutectic gel polymer electrolyte exhibits excellent non&#8208;flammability, high ionic conductivity (1.67&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C), and high oxidation voltage (up to 4.35&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+). The Li||LFP cell based on the newly developed deep eutectic gel polymer electrolyte can achieve superior long&#8208;term cycling stability at a wide range of rates.

         <title>Bioinspired Metalation of the Metal&#8208;Organic Framework MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2 for Photocatalytic NADH Regeneration and Gas&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Solid Three&#8208;Phase Enzymatic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired metalation of the MOF MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2 was accomplished by incorporating the electron&#8208;transfer unit of a Rh complex for facilitated photocatalytic NADH regeneration. By immobilizing formate dehydrogenase onto the hydrophobic layer of the membrane, a gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface around the enzyme site could be formed for sustained and enhanced formic acid production coupled with in situ generated NADH.







Abstract
Coenzyme NADH regeneration is crucial for sustained photoenzymatic catalysis of CO2 reduction. However, light&#8208;driven NADH regeneration still suffers from the low regeneration efficiency and requires the use of a homogeneous Rh complex. Herein, a Rh complex&#8208;based electron transfer unit was chemically attached onto the linker of the MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2. The coupling between the light&#8208;harvesting iminopyridine unit and electron&#8208;transferring Rh&#8208;complex facilitated the photo&#8208;induced electron transfer for the NADH regeneration with the yield of 66.4&#8201;% in 60&#8197;mins for 5&#8197;cycles. The formate dehydrogenase was further deposited onto the hydrophobic layer of the membrane by a reverse filtering technique, which forms the gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid reaction interface around the enzyme site. It gave an enhanced formic acid yield of 9.5&#8197;mM in 24&#8197;hours coupled with the in situ regenerated NADH. The work could shed light on the construction of integrated inorganic&#8208;enzyme hybrid systems for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Highly Selective Carbonylation of CH3Cl to Acetic Acid Catalyzed by Pyridine&#8208;Treated MOR Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative reaction strategy for the transformation of methane into acetic acid via CH3Cl carbonylation over H&#8208;zeolites is reported. A 99.3&#8201;% acetic acid (AA) and methyl acetate (MA) selectivity was obtained over pyridine&#8208;pretreated MOR at 523&#8197;K and 2.0&#8197;MPa. This strategy enables efficient conversion of methane into oxygenates under mild conditions.







Abstract
The selective conversion of methane to high value&#8208;added chemicals under mild conditions is of great significance for the commercially viable and sustainable utilization of methane but remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a strategy for efficiently converting methane to acetic acid via CH3Cl as an intermediate. Up to 99.3&#8201;% acetic acid and methyl acetate (AA+MA) selectivity was achieved over pyridine&#8208;pretreated MOR (MOR&#8208;8) under moderate conditions of 523&#8197;K and 2.0&#8197;MPa. Water, conventionally detrimental to carbonylation reaction over zeolite catalysts, was conducive to the production of AA in the current reaction system. In the 100&#8197;h continuous test with the MOR&#8208;8 catalyst, the average AA+MA selectivity remained over 98&#8201;%. AA was formed by carbonylation of methoxy groups within 8&#8208;membered rings of MOR followed by hydrolysis. This strategy provided an approach for highly efficient utilization of methane to oxygenates under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Porous Organic Salts: Diversifying Void Structures and Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various aromatic sulfonic acids and amines were self&#8208;assembled by charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding to form porous organic salts. This study demonstrates the advantages of diverse porous organic salts, such as all&#8208;organic, extremely facile preparation methods, diverse void structures and environments, and excellent CO2 adsorption properties.







Abstract
Porous organic salts (POSs) are porous organic materials, in which various aromatic sulfonic acids and amines are regularly self&#8208;assembled by charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding. POSs exhibit high solubility in highly polar solvents. Therefore, they are prepared via facile recrystallization and exhibit high recyclability. In this study, tetrahedral&#8208;structured tetrasulfonic acid and triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) were combined to construct POSs with rigid diamond networks called diamondoid porous organic salts (d&#8208;POSs). Furthermore, by introducing substituents (e.g., F, Cl, Br, or I) at the para&#8208;positions of benzene rings of TPMA, these substituents were exposed on the void surface of d&#8208;POSs, and their diamond networks were distorted. This induced the formation of a variety of void structures and environments in the d&#8208;POSs, which significantly affected their gas adsorption behavior. In particular, the d&#8208;POS from TPMA substituted by fluorine exhibited very high CO2 adsorption of 182&#8197;mL(STP)&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;atm in all&#8208;organic porous materials.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization of Sila&#8208;Adamantane and Its Ensuing Optical Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanistic insight into the isomerization synthesis of sila&#8208;adamantane enables the regioselective functionalization of sila&#8208;adamantane at its 1&#8208;, 2&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 5&#8208;, and 7&#8208;positions. Substitution at the 1&#8208;position of the cluster core significantly impacts optical absorbance relative to exocyclic or 2&#8208;substitution.







Abstract
The first syntheses of functionalized sila&#8208;adamantanes via site&#8208;selective reactions are described. Mechanistic inquiry into the isomerization of sila&#8208;adamantane revealed new approaches for installing halides at the 2&#8208;position of the cluster. Meanwhile, isomerization via Lewis acid catalysts with non&#8208;nucleophilic counteranions provided access to sila&#8208;adamantane on the gram&#8208;scale, enabling us to discover strategies for substituting its 1&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 5&#8208;, and 7&#8208;positions with identical or distinct functional groups. Optical absorbance and density functional theory studies show that &#963;&#8208;withdrawing substituents at the 1&#8208;position strongly perturb optical absorbance in sila&#8208;adamantane, whereas substituents at the exocyclic and 2&#8208;position are optically inert. As silicon diamondoids are atomically precise models for silicon nanocrystals, our findings suggest that passivation at tertiary surface sites carries an outsized impact on the optical properties of surface&#8208;functionalized Si nanocrystals.

The galactose&#8208;modified zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework ZTIG, which has high order multi&#8208;photon excited fluorescence properties, can realize NIR&#8208;II excited fluorescent imaging and photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
The fabrication of high&#8208;order multiphoton excited fluorescent materials for second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) light&#8208;induced fluorescence imaging has always been an intractable challenge. In this study, a reasonable strategy guided by theoretical calculations was employed to fabricate a novel high&#8208;order multiphoton excited fluorescence (H&#8208;MPEF)&#8208;responsive UiO&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF, ZrTc). Strategically, the functionalization of the photonic&#8208;responsive thiazolothiazole&#8208;based organic ligand gave rise to amplified H&#8208;MPEF (four&#8208;photon activity) performance and prolonged excitation wavelength (1550&#8197;nm) of ZrTcI. The results reveal that the extended &#960;&#8208;electron system, enhanced charge transfer, improved dipole moment, and weakened &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions within the MOFs endow them with excellent H&#8208;MPEF performance for NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;induced fluorescence imaging. It is an extremely rare report on H&#8208;MPEF bioimaging using MOFs and provide a universal strategy for the fabrication of H&#8208;MPEF&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Scanning Potential&#8208;Gated Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Highly Sensitive Sensing of Dopamine in Living Rat Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated the first fast&#8208;scanning potential&#8208;gated organic electrochemical transistor (FSP&#8208;OECT) for in vivo dopamine (DA) sensing, featuring high sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility, and stability. It was successfully applied for in vivo DA sensing at low basal levels as well as the electrically stimulated release of DA.







Abstract
Developing techniques for the highly sensitive assay of neurotransmitters is essential for understanding physiological and pathological processes. Here, we demonstrate a fast&#8208;scanning potential (FSP)&#8208;gated organic electrochemical transistor (OECT): for the highly sensitive sensing of dopamine (DA) in a living rat brain.

     alt="Fast-Scanning Potential-Gated Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Highly Sensitive Sensing of Dopamine in Living Rat Brain"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have demonstrated the first fast-scanning potential-gated organic electrochemical transistor (FSP-OECT) for in vivo dopamine (DA) sensing, featuring high sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility, and stability. It was successfully applied for in vivo DA sensing at low basal levels as well as the electrically stimulated release of DA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing techniques for the highly sensitive assay of neurotransmitters is essential for understanding physiological and pathological processes. Here, we demonstrate a fast-scanning potential (FSP)-gated organic electrochemical transistor (OECT): for the highly sensitive sensing of dopamine (DA) in a living rat brain. The configuration combines the selectivity of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) with the high sensitivity of an OECT. The combined use of FSP as a gating mode and transconductance (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) as a sensing parameter further improve the sensing performance in terms of sensitivity, limit of detection, reproducibility, and stability. The FSP-OECT exhibits a sensitivity of 0.899&#8197;S&#8201;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a low limit of detection down to 5&#8197;nM and was validated for in vivo monitoring of the basal level and electrically stimulated release of DA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Aptamers with Selectively Enhanced Biostability in the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamer sgc8c equipped with an ATP&#8208;responsive protection module, termed ARP&#8208;sgc8c, was designed. ARP&#8208;sgc8c could be selectively protected from nuclease degradation in the tumor microenvironment through specific incorporation along with high&#8208;concentration ATP, while its rapid degradation was maintained in healthy tissues.







Abstract
Aptamers are emerging as promising molecular tools in cancer&#8208;targeted theranostics. Improving their in vivo stability has been a critical issue in promoting clinical translation, but such efforts could lead to more serious side effects resulting from prolonged retention in healthy organs. To address this problem, we developed an environment&#8208;responsive stabilization strategy for the selective enhancement of aptamer biostability in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Briefly, by means of the end extension of an ATP&#8208;responsive protection (ARP) module, the designed aptamer could be protected from nuclease degradation through the specific incorporation of ATP. Based on our in vivo results, this ARP&#8208;aptamer probe was effectively accumulated in tumors via aptamer&#8208;based molecular recognition. It showed selectively prolonged tumor retention time, but rapid digestion in healthy organs. Our strategy should provide a new paradigm for the development of organ&#8208;specific nucleic acid&#8208;based imaging and therapeutic agents.

         <title>Asymmetrically Doping a Platinum Atom into a Au38 Nanocluster for Changing the Electron Configuration and Reactivity in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt1Au37(SCH2PhtBu)24 and Pt2Au36(SCH2PhtBu)24 nanoclusters are prepared by doping one and two Pt atoms into the kernels of Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24.This study provides an opportunity for systematically investigating the electron configuration change of the nanoclusters in the consecutive doping process and shows the order of electrocatalytic activity: Pt1Au37 &gt; Au38 &gt; Pt2Au36.







Abstract
It is an obstacle to precisely manipulate a doped heteroatom into a desired position in a metal nanocluster. Herein, we overcome this difficulty to obtain Pt1Au37(SCH2PhtBu)24 and Pt2Au36(SCH2PhtBu)24 nanoclusters via controllably doping Pt atoms into the kernels of Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24. We reveal that asymmetrical doping of one Pt atom into either of the cores of Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24 elevates the relative energy of the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) accompanied by one valence electron loss of Pt1Au37(SCH2PhtBu)24, compared to Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24 with 14 electrons, while symmetrical doping of two Pt atoms into the cores of Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24 narrows the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (LUMO: lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of Pt2Au36(SCH2PhtBu)24 with two valence electrons less. Consequently, Pt1Au37(SCH2PhtBu)24 shows an electron&#8208;spin&#8208;induced high activity for CO2 electroreduction, whereas Pt2Au36(SCH2PhtBu)24 is least efficient and Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24 has a decent performance.

         <title>A DNA Barcode&#8208;Based Aptasensor Enables Rapid Testing of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Viruses in Swine Saliva Using Electrochemical Readout</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid, simple, and reagent&#8208;less dual&#8208;electrode electrochemical chip (DEE&#8208;Chip) was developed using a barcode&#8208;releasing electroactive aptamer for on&#8208;farm detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDv). This biosensor demonstrated a diagnostic sensitivity of 83&#8201;% and specificity of 100&#8201;% using 12 porcine saliva samples with a concordance value of 92&#8201;% at an analysis time of one hour.







Abstract
Pen&#8208;side testing of farm animals for infectious diseases is critical for preventing transmission in herds and providing timely intervention. However, most existing pathogen tests have to be conducted in centralized labs with sample&#8208;to&#8208;result times of 2&#8211;4&#8197;days. Herein we introduce a test that uses a dual&#8208;electrode electrochemical chip (DEE&#8208;Chip) and a barcode&#8208;releasing electroactive aptamer for rapid on&#8208;farm detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDv). The sensor exploits inter&#8208;electrode spacing reduction and active field mediated transport to accelerate barcode movement from electroactive aptamers to the detection electrode, thus expediting assay operation. The test yielded a clinically relevant limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 6&#8197;nM (0.37&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1) in saliva&#8208;spiked PEDv samples. Clinical evaluation of this biosensor with 12 porcine saliva samples demonstrated a diagnostic sensitivity of 83&#8201;% and specificity of 100&#8201;% with a concordance value of 92&#8201;% at an analysis time of one hour.

A two&#8208;dimensional polyimide&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) with high loading density of redox&#8208;active centers and a mesoporous channel for facile Li+&#8208;ion diffusion has been designed and fabricated, exhibiting one of the best performances among the thus far reported COF&#8208;based cathodes for Li&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are gaining increasing attention as renewable cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, COF electrodes reported so far still exhibit unsatisfying capacity due to their limited active site density and insufficient utilization. Herein, a new two&#8208;dimensional polyimide&#8208;linked COF, HATN&#8208;AQ&#8208;COF with multiple redox&#8208;active sites for storing Li+ ions, was designed and fabricated from a new module of 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexacarboxyl hexaazatrinaphthalene trianhydrides with a 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone linker. HATN&#8208;AQ&#8208;COF possessing excellent stability, good conductivity, and a large pore size of 3.8&#8197;nm enables the stable and fast ion transport. This, in combination with the abundant redox active sites, results in a high reversible capacity of 319&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C (1&#8197;C=358&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) for the HATN&#8208;AQ&#8208;COF electrode with a high active site utilization of 89&#8201;% and good cycle performance, representing one of the best performances among the reported COF electrodes.

         <title>Hydrogen Production and Water Desalination with On&#8208;demand Electricity Output Enabled by Electrochemical Neutralization Chemistry</title>

An electrochemical neutralization chemistry strategy that couples acidic hydrogen evolution and alkaline hydrazine oxidation with ionic exchange enables utilization of the chemical energy and low&#8208;grade heat from the surroundings for hydrogen production with electricity output.







Abstract
Energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production can be achieved by using renewables or decoupling the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction from overall water splitting, which still needs electricity input. We have realized hydrogen production and water desalination with on&#8208;demand electricity output via an electrochemical neutralization chemistry strategy that couples acidic hydrogen evolution and alkaline hydrazine oxidation with ionic exchange. The electrochemical neutralization cells allow efficient use of chemical energy and low&#8208;grade heat from the surroundings to output 0.81&#8197;kWh electricity per m3 of hydrogen. Cell function can be rapidly switched to electricity output with a high peak power density up to 85.5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 or spontaneous hydrogen production at a high rate up to 70.1&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 without breaking cell operation or changing cell configuration. Fast water desalination is simultaneously achieved at a high salt removal rate of 56.1&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 without an external electricity supply.

         <title>Ternary Alloy PtWMn as a Mn Nanoreservoir for High&#8208;Field MRI Monitoring and Highly Selective Ferroptosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ternary alloy PtWMn nanoplatform is developed as a Mn reservoir that exhibits efficient storage, specific delivery and accurate release of Mn ions for high&#8208;specificity ferroptosis&#8208;based cancer therapy. Such a smart nanoplatform can exert a responsive imaging signal in dual&#8208;mode (T1&#8208; or T2&#8208;weighted) high&#8208;field MRI, which enables the real&#8208;time monitoring of Mn release within the tumor microenvironment and of ferroptosis initiation.







Abstract
Ferroptosis exhibits potential to damage drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells. However, it is still restricted with the &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; toxicity from the undesirable leakage of metal ions from ferroptosis agents, and the lack of reliable imaging for monitoring the ferroptosis process in living systems. Herein, we develop a novel ternary alloy PtWMn nanocube as a Mn reservoir, and further design a microenvironment&#8208;triggered nanoplatform that can accurately release Mn ions within the tumor to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, produce O2 and consume excess glutathione for synergistically enhancing nonferrous ferroptosis. Moreover, this nanoplatform exerts a responsive signal in high&#8208;field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which enables the real&#8208;time report of Mn release and the monitoring of ferroptosis initiation through the signal changes of T1&#8208;/T2&#8208;MRI. Thus, our nanoplatform provides a novel strategy to store, deliver and precisely release Mn ions for MRI&#8208;guided high&#8208;specificity ferroptosis therapy.

         <title>Precision Synthesis of Various Low&#8208;Bandgap Donor&#8211;Acceptor Alternating Conjugated Polymers via Living Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Catalyst&#8208;Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8211;acceptor alternating conjugated polymers with various electronic characteristics, including strong donor&#8211;strong acceptor, are synthesized via living Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization in a controlled manner. The polymerization also works with a complex quateraryl monomer and allows for one&#8208;pot di(tri)block copolymer synthesis. The resulting polymers have tunable optical and electrochemical properties based on the combination of building units.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate that living Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization (SCTP) using a RuPhos Pd G3 precatalyst is a versatile method for the precision synthesis of various donor&#8211;acceptor alternating conjugated polymers (DA ACPs). First, the living SCTP of biaryl monomers with combinations of both medium to strong A and D were optimized to produce DA ACPs with controlled number average molecular weight (Mn), narrow dispersity (&#208;, 1.05&#8211;1.29), and high yield (&gt;87&#8201;%). Moreover, its expansion to controlled polymerization (Mn=9.2&#8211;40.0&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1) of an A1&#8208;D&#8208;A2&#8208;D quateraryl monomer containing diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP; strong A) was successful. The living SCTP also enabled the efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis of various diblock and triblock copolymers. Lastly, the DA ACPs showed tunable optical band gap (Egopt, from 1.29 to 1.77&#8197;eV) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level (from &#8722;5.57 to &#8722;4.75&#8197;eV), while their block copolymers exhibited broad absorption ranges and promising visible light&#8208;harvesting properties.

         <title>&#8220;Sandwich&#8221; Diimine&#8208;Copper Catalysts for C&#8722;H Functionalization by Carbene Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalyst platform for C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization has been discovered. &#8220;Sandwich&#8221; diimine&#8208;copper(I) complexes catalyze reactions of alkane, ether, and amine C&#8722;H bonds with a large panel of diazo compounds. Additionally, the first metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H methylation by CH2N2 is disclosed. The electrophilicity and extreme steric bulk of these catalysts are likely reasons for their efficiency.







Abstract
We report here &#8220;sandwich&#8221; diimine&#8208;copper(I) catalysts for C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization. Reactions of alkanes and ethers with trimethylsilyldiazomethane, ethyl diazoacetate, and trifluoromethyl&#8208;diazomethane have been demonstrated. We also report C(sp3)&#8722;H bond methylation, benzylation, and diphenylmethylation by diazomethane, aryldiazomethanes, and diphenyldiazomethane. These reactions are rare examples of base&#8208;metal catalyzed, intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalizations by employing unactivated diazo compounds. Electrophilicity and unique steric environment of &#8220;sandwich&#8221;&#8208;copper catalysts are likely reasons for their catalytic efficiency.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report here &#8220;sandwich&#8221; diimine-copper(I) catalysts for C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond functionalization. Reactions of alkanes and ethers with trimethylsilyldiazomethane, ethyl diazoacetate, and trifluoromethyl-diazomethane have been demonstrated. We also report C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond methylation, benzylation, and diphenylmethylation by diazomethane, aryldiazomethanes, and diphenyldiazomethane. These reactions are rare examples of base-metal catalyzed, intermolecular C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H functionalizations by employing unactivated diazo compounds. Electrophilicity and unique steric environment of &#8220;sandwich&#8221;-copper catalysts are likely reasons for their catalytic efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Eutectic Electrolyte with Unique Solvation Structure for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brand new eutectic electrolyte consisting of ethylene glycol (EG) and ZnCl2 has a unique solvation structure and could enable the formation of a Cl&#8208;rich organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase film on a Zn anode, realizing highly reversible Zn plating/stripping.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIB) present great potential in energy storage due to low cost and high safety. However, the poor stability, dendrite growth, and narrow electrochemical window limit their practical application. Herein, we develop a new eutectic electrolyte consisting of ethylene glycol (EG) and ZnCl2 for dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;lifespan ZIBs. The EG molecules participate in the Zn2+ solvation via coordination and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions. Optimizing the ZnCl2/EG molar ratio (1&#8201;:&#8201;4) can strengthen intermolecular interactions to form [ZnCl(EG)]+ and [ZnCl(EG)2]+ cations. The dissociation&#8211;reduction of these complex cations enables the formation of a Cl&#8208;rich organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase film on a Zn anode, realizing highly reversible Zn plating/stripping with long&#8208;term stability of &#8776;3200&#8197;h. Furthermore, the polyaniline||Zn cell manifests decent cycling performance with &#8776;78&#8201;% capacity retention after 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles, and the assembled pouch cell demonstrates high safety and stable capacity. This work opens an avenue for developing eutectic electrolytes for high&#8208;safety and practical ZIBs.

         <title>Straightforward Access to Multifunctional &#960;&#8208;Conjugated P&#8208;Heterocycles Featuring an Internal Ylidic Bond
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple synthesis of P&#8208;heterocycles featuring an internal ylidic bond is reported. The stability of the compounds tolerates post&#8208;functionalization (direct arylation) and the strategy is also compatible with the preparation of polyaromatic scaffolds (acenes, helicenes). Molecular engineering allows tuning the optical and redox properties, making them valuable dyes for a large panel of photonic or opto&#8208;electronic applications.







Abstract
We report the straightforward one&#8208;pot synthesis of novel 5&#8208; or 6&#8208;membered P&#8208;heterocycles featuring an internal ylidic bond: P&#8208;containing acenaphthylenes and phenanthrenes. The stability of the compounds tolerates post&#8208;functionalization through direct arylation to introduce electron&#8208;rich/poor substituents and the synthetic strategy is also compatible with the preparation of more elaborate polyaromatic scaffolds such as acenes and helicenes. Using a joint experimental (X&#8208;ray analysis, optical and redox properties) and theoretical approach, we perform a full structure&#8211;property relationships study on these new platforms. In particular, we show that molecular engineering allows not only tuning their absorption/emission across the entire visible range but also endowing them with chiroptical or non&#8208;linear optical properties, making them valuable dyes for a large panel of photonic or opto&#8208;electronic applications.

         <title>Tailored Multivalent Targeting of Siglecs with Photosensitizing Liposome Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising approach towards optically active biohybrid systems that selectively bind receptors of the sialic acid&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectins (siglecs) family is described. To this end, siglec&#8208;modified supported lipid bilayers act as cell membrane mimics that interact in a multivalent fashion with photosensitizer&#8208;loaded vesicles, showing a potential for targeting siglec&#8208;expressing cells with photosensitizing nanocarriers.







Abstract
The modification of surfaces with multiple ligands allows the formation of platforms for the study of multivalency in diverse processes. Herein we use this approach for the implementation of a photosensitizer (PS)&#8208;nanocarrier system that binds efficiently to siglec&#8208;10, a member of the CD33 family of siglecs (sialic acid (SA)&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectins). In particular, a zinc phthalocyanine derivative bearing three SA moieties (PcSA) has been incorporated in the membrane of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), retaining its photophysical properties upon insertion into the SUV's membrane. The interaction of these biohybrid systems with human siglec&#8208;10&#8208;displaying supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) has shown the occurrence of weakly multivalent, superselective interactions between vesicle and SLB. The SLB therefore acts as an excellent cell membrane mimic, while the binding with PS&#8208;loaded SUVs shows the potential for targeting siglec&#8208;expressing cells with photosensitizing nanocarriers.

         <title>Atroposelective Construction of Nine&#8208;Membered Carbonate&#8208;Bridged Biaryls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the atroposelective construction of nine&#8208;membered carbonate&#8208;bridged biaryls was achieved through a ring&#8208;expansion process via vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM) intermediates. This strategy allows the convenient construction of bridged biaryls with broad functional group tolerance under mild conditions. In bioassay studies, several agents showed considerable antiproliferative activity via the mitochondrial&#8208;related apoptosis mechanism.







Abstract
We herein demonstrated an efficient method for the atroposelective construction of nine&#8208;membered carbonate&#8208;bridged biaryls through vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM) intermediates. Diverse products with desirable pharmacological features were synthesized in satisfying yields and good to excellent enantioselectivities. In subsequent bioassays, several agents showed considerable antiproliferative activity via the mitochondrial&#8208;related apoptosis mechanism. Further transformations produced more structural diversity and may inspire new ideas for developing functional molecules.

         <title>An Ultrastable 155&#8208;Nuclei Silver Nanocluster Protected by Thiacalix[4]arene and Cyclohexanethiol for Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual C5h&#8208;symmetric silver nanocluster (Ag155) with the highest reported nuclearity was prepared by exploiting the protection of the macrocyclic ligand p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylthiacalix[4]arene (H4TC4A) and cyclohexanethiol (CySH). This silver nanocluster exhibits excellent stability in solution and photothermal conversion efficiency.







Abstract
Thiacalix[4]arenes have emerged as a family of macrocyclic ligands to protect metal nanoparticles, but it remains a great challenge to solve the mystery of their structures at the atomic level, especially for those larger than 2&#8197;nm. Here, we report the largest known mixed&#8208;valence silver nanocluster [Ag155(CyS)40(TC4A)5Cl2] (Ag155) protected by deprotonated cyclohexanethiol (CySH) and macrocyclic ligand p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylthiacalix[4]arene (H4TC4A). Its single&#8208;crystal structure consists of a metallic core of four concentric shells, Ag13@Ag42@Ag30@Ag70, lined with a organic skin of 40CyS&#8722; and 5TC4A4&#8722; and 2Cl&#8722;. Ag155 manifests an unusual pseudo&#8208;5&#8208;fold symmetry dictated by the intrinsic metal atom packing and the regioselective distribution of mixed protective ligands. This work not only reveals a macrocyclic ligand effect on the formation of a large silver nanocluster, but also provides a new structural archetype for comprehensively perceiving their interface and metal kernel structures.

&lt;sub&gt;5h&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric silver nanocluster (&lt;b&gt;Ag155&lt;/b&gt;) with the highest reported nuclearity was prepared by exploiting the protection of the macrocyclic ligand &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylthiacalix[4]arene (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TC4A) and cyclohexanethiol (CySH).

         <title>Spatiotemporal Mapping of Efficient Chiral Induction by Helicene&#8208;Type Additives in Copolymer Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special class of helicene&#8208;type additives, which are straightforward to synthesize in large amounts, induce strong chirality in polyfluorene copolymer thin films. Advanced chirality&#8208;sensitive microscopy techniques and ultrafast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods based on transient circular dichroism and transient circularly polarized luminescence reveal the supramolecular origin of the chiroptical properties.







Abstract
We observed efficient induction of chirality in polyfluorene copolymer thin films by mixing with helicene&#8208;type chiral additives based on the dibenzo[c,h]acridine motif. Images obtained from circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) microscopy provide information about the chiral arrangements in the thin films with diffraction&#8208;limited resolution. The CD signal shows a characteristic dependence on the film thickness, which supports a supramolecular origin of the strong chiral response of the copolymer. In particular, we demonstrate the discrimination between films of opposite chirality based on their ultrafast transient chiral response through the use of femtosecond broadband CD spectroscopy and a newly developed setup for transient CPL spectroscopy with 28&#8197;ps time resolution. A systematic variation of the enantiomeric excess of the chiral additive shows that the &#8220;Sergeants and Soldiers&#8221; concept and &#8220;Majority Rules&#8221; are not obeyed.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Dependent Ultrasensitive Dynamic Wrinkling on Floating Films Induced by Photo&#8208;Orientation of Azopolymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
During polarized light illumination, a floating azo&#8208;film experiences a wealth of ultrafast wrinkling evolution coupled with unprecedented sequential wrinkling orientation conversion (from polarization&#8208;parallel to polarization&#8208;perpendicular). The different polarization&#8208;dependent sequential photo&#8208;orientation for azo side chains and azo&#8208;grafted main chains of azopolymers that are involved is revealed experimentally for the first time.







Abstract
Ubiquitous surface wrinkling has been well&#8208;studied theoretically and experimentally. How to modulate the stress state of a liquid&#8208;supported system for the unexploited wrinkling capabilities remains a challenge. Here we report a simple linearly&#8208;polarized&#8208;light illumination to spatiotemporally trigger ultrasensitive in situ dynamic wrinkling on a floating azo&#8208;film. The smart combination of the liquid substrate with photoresponsive azo&#8208;moieties leads to the light&#8208;induced ultrafast wrinkling evolution, accompanied by unprecedented sequential wrinkling orientation conversion (from polarization&#8208;parallel to polarization&#8208;perpendicular). The involved different polarization&#8208;dependent sequential photo&#8208;orientation for azo side chains and azo&#8208;grafted main chains of azopolymers is disclosed experimentally for the first time. Meanwhile, programmable dynamic wrinkling with all&#8208;optical switchable surface topographies is available, which has wide application potentials in photoresponsive soft photonics.

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed switchable site&#8208;selective alkene hydroalkylation was developed. The selection of reaction temperatures led to protocols that provide regiodivergent hydroalkylated products starting from a single alkene substrate.







Abstract
Regiodivergent alkene functionalization that produces either regioisomer starting from the same raw materials is desirable. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed switchable site&#8208;selective alkene hydroalkylation. The selection of reaction temperatures leads to protocols that provide regiodivergent hydroalkylated products starting from a single alkene substrate. This protocol allows the convenient synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;branched protected amines, both of which are important to the fields of pharmaceutical chemistry and biochemistry. In addition, enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;branched alkylamines can be accessed in a catalytic asymmetric variant. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the formation of a more stable nickelacycle provides the driving force of migration. The thermodynamic and kinetic properties of different reduction elimination intermediates are responsible for the switchable site&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Concise Synthesis of Tunicamycin&#8197;V and Discovery of a Cytostatic DPAGT1 Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A B&#252;chner&#8211;Curtius&#8211;Schlotterbeck&#8208;type reaction enabled the total synthesis of tunicamycin&#8197;V (TN&#8208;V), a nonselective phosphotransferase inhibitor, in just 15 steps from D&#8208;galactal in 21&#8201;% overall yield. The short and high&#8208;yielding synthetic route was also adapted for the synthesis of analogues, thus leading to the discovery of a novel cytostatic tunicamycin analogue, TN&#8208;TMPA, with high DPAGT1 selectivity.







Abstract
A short total synthesis of tunicamycin&#8197;V (1), a non&#8208;selective phosphotransferase inhibitor, is achieved via a B&#252;chner&#8211;Curtius&#8211;Schlotterbeck type reaction. Tunicamycin&#8197;V can be synthesized in 15 chemical steps from D&#8208;galactal with 21&#8201;% overall yield. The established synthetic scheme is operationally very simple and flexible to introduce building blocks of interest. The inhibitory activity of one of the designed analogues 28 against human dolichyl&#8208;phosphate N&#8208;acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase 1 (DPAGT1) is 12.5&#8197;times greater than 1. While tunicamycins are cytotoxic molecules with a low selectivity, the novel analogue 28 displays selective cytostatic activity against breast cancer cell lines including a triple&#8208;negative breast cancer.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Syngas to Higher Alcohols via Tandem Integration of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch Synthesis and Reductive Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst engineering enables the single&#8208;pot integration of solid nanoparticulate and molecular cobalt catalysts in a slurry&#8208;phase tandem Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis/olefin reductive hydroformylation process for a direct and highly selective conversion of syngas (H2/CO) to higher alcohols. The new tandem process contributes to bridging the traditionally dissevered disciplines of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
The selective conversion of syngas to higher alcohols is an attractive albeit elusive route in the quest for effective production of chemicals from alternative carbon resources. We report the tandem integration of solid cobalt Fischer&#8211;Tropsch and molecular hydroformylation catalysts in a one&#8208;pot slurry&#8208;phase process. Unprecedented selectivities (&gt;50&#8197;wt&#8201;%) to C2+ alcohols are achieved at CO conversion levels &gt;70&#8201;%, alongside negligible CO2 side&#8208;production. The efficient overall transformation is enabled by catalyst engineering, bridging gaps in operation temperature and intrinsic selectivity which have classically precluded integration of these reactions in a single conversion step. Swift capture of 1&#8208;olefin Fischer&#8211;Tropsch primary products by the molecular hydroformylation catalyst, presumably within the pores of the solid catalyst is key for high alcohol selectivity. The results underscore that controlled cooperation between solid aggregate and soluble molecular metal catalysts, which pertain to traditionally dichotomic realms of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis, is a promising blueprint toward selective conversion processes.

         <title>Formation of a Hybrid 1&#8208;Bora&#8208;3&#8208;boratabenzene Heteroarene Anion Derivative</title>

The unique synthesis of a boryl&#8208;substituted borole system by means of a 1,1&#8208;hydroboration/1,1&#8208;alkenylboration sequence provided access to the unprecedented 1&#8208;bora&#8208;3&#8208;boratabenzene class of compounds.







Abstract
The B(C6F5)2&#8208;substituted borole 2&#8901;SMe2 was obtained from the phenyl bis(trimethylsilylethynyl) borane SMe2 adduct (1&#8901;SMe2) by a synthetic sequence containing a rare 1,1&#8208;hydroboration reaction. Subsequent thermolysis at 50&#8201;&#176;C converted it to the bicyclic borenium/borate zwitterion 3&#8901;SMe2. Photolysis of 3&#8901;SMe2 gave the diboracyclohexadiene derivative 4&#8901;SMe2, which after ligand exchange with N,N&#8208;dimesitylimidazolylidene and deprotonation gave the 1&#8208;bora&#8208;3&#8208;boratabenzene anion derivative as its potassium salt 6. Some unique follow&#8208;up reactions of the unsaturated diboron containing six&#8208;membered heterocycles were investigated.

         <title>Ultrafast Triplet&#8211;Singlet Exciton Interconversion in Narrowband Blue Organoboron Emitters Doped with Heavy Chalcogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selenium&#8208;doped polycyclic organoboron emitter exhibits ultrafast triplet&#8211;singlet exciton interconversion ability in addition to strong narrowband blue emission. Its spin&#8208;flip reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rate exceeds 108&#8197;s&#8722;1 (100&#8197;million times spin inversion per second), enabling superimposed fluorescence with full exciton utilization. This breakthrough shatters the stereotypical physicochemical views of conventional thermally activated delayed fluorescence limited by slow RISC.







Abstract
Narrowband emissive organoboron emitters featuring the multi&#8208;resonance (MR) effect have now become a critical material component for constructing high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with pure emission colors. These MR organoboron emitters are capable of exhibiting high&#8208;efficiency narrowband thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) by allowing triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). However, RISC involving spin&#8208;flip exciton upconversion is generally the rate&#8208;limiting step in the overall TADF; hence, a deeper understanding and precise control of the RISC dynamics are ongoing crucial challenges. Here, we introduce the first MR organoboron emitter (CzBSe) doped with a selenium atom, demonstrating a record&#8208;high RISC rate exceeding 108&#8197;s&#8722;1, which is even higher than its fluorescence radiation rate. Furthermore, the spin&#8208;flip upconversion process in CzBSe can be accelerated by factors of &#8776;20000 and &#8776;800, compared to those of its oxygen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;doped homologs (CzBO and CzBS), respectively. Unlike CzBO and CzBS, the photophysical rate&#8208;limiting step in CzBSe is no longer RISC, but the fluorescence radiation process; this behavior is completely different from the conventional time&#8208;delaying TADF limited by the slow RISC. Benefitting from its ultrafast exciton spin conversion ability, OLEDs incorporating CzBSe achieved a maximum external electroluminescence quantum efficiency as high as 23.9&#8201;%, accompanied by MR&#8208;induced blue narrowband emission and significantly alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off features.

A method for late&#8208;stage peptide ligation and macrocyclization through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C7&#8208;selective alkylation of tryptophan residues has been developed. This method is compatible with internal olefins and represents the first example of site&#8208;selective peptide C&#8722;H alkylation through deconjugative isomerization.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation is a step&#8208;economical strategy for peptide functionalization. Herein, we report the method of late&#8208;stage peptide ligation and macrocyclization through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed alkylation of tryptophan residues at the C7 position. This method utilizes a N&#8208;PtBu2 directing group and tolerates various peptide and alkene substrates. Utilizing internal olefins, this study represents the first example of site&#8208;selective peptide C&#8722;H alkylation through deconjugative isomerization. Furthermore, our method provides access to peptide macrocycles with unique Trp(C7)&#8208;alkyl crosslinks and potent cytotoxicity towards cancer cells.

         <title>Highly Active and Stable Li2S&#8722;Cu Nanocomposite Cathodes Enabled by Kinetically Favored Displacement Interconversion between Cu2S and Li2S</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanostructured Li2S&#8722;Cu composite is fabricated and it is demonstrated that Cu progressively participates in the redox processes and fundamentally alters the redox couple from anion&#8208;type Li2S/S to cation&#8208;type Cu/Cu2S, which leads to a drastically reduced activation potential (2.35&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), superior rate capability, and stable long&#8208;term cycling performance.







Abstract
The high activation barrier, inferior rate performance, and short cycling life severely constrain the practical applications of the high&#8208;capacity Li2S cathode. Herein, we fabricate a Li2S&#8722;Cu nanocomposite with a drastically reduced activation potential, fast rate capability, and extraordinary cycling stability even under a practically relevant areal capacity of 2.96&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Detailed experimental investigations aided by theoretical calculations indicate that instead of converting to S8 via troublesome soluble lithium polysulfides, Li2S is thermodynamically and kinetically more favorable to react with Cu by the displacement reaction, which alters the redox couple from Li2S/S to Cu/Cu2S, leading to the excellent electrochemical performance. Moreover, the stability of the composite is demonstrated in the full&#8208;cell configuration consisting of commercial graphite anodes. This work provides an innovative and effective approach to realize highly activated and stable Li2S cathode materials.

&lt;p&gt;A nanostructured Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&#8722;Cu composite is fabricated and it is demonstrated that Cu progressively participates in the redox processes and fundamentally alters the redox couple from anion-type Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/S to cation-type Cu/Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, which leads to a drastically reduced activation potential (2.35&#8197;V vs. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li), superior rate capability, and stable long-term cycling performance.

         <title>Electrostatic&#8208;Induced Crystal&#8208;Rearrangement of Porous Organic Cage Membrane for CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Competitive CO2 capture in a porous organic cage membrane can be assisted by ionic liquid molecules (e.g., BMIMBF4). Ionic liquid molecules electrostatically induce the crystal&#8208;rearrangement of cage molecules to construct regular nanochannels as well as aiding in situ nanochannel regulation.







Abstract
Porous Organic Cages (POCs) with tunable tailoring chemistry properties and polymer&#8208;like processing conditions are of great potential for molecular selective membranes, but it remains challenging in the assembly of high crystalline POCs with regular nanochannels for effective molecular sieving. Here we report an electrostatic&#8208;induced crystal&#8208;rearrangement strategy for the design of a POC membrane with heterostructure. Due to electrostatic attraction, ionic liquid molecules induced cage molecules to rearrange into a sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm uniform and defect&#8208;free crystal layer, which displayed competitive CO2 separation performance. The optimized hetero&#8208;structured membrane exhibited an attractive CO2/N2 separation selectivity of over 130, which was superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes, accompanied with excellent long&#8208;term and thermal shock stability. This strategy provides a new inspiration for the preparation of crystal&#8208;rearranged membranes with regular channels for gas molecule sieving.

         <title>Activating Lattice Oxygen in Layered Lithium Oxides through Cation Vacancies for Enhanced Urea Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beginning with cation&#8208;vacancy controllable LiNiO2, the origin of the high performance and the structure&#8211;activity correlations was studied. The results indicate that lattice oxygen activated by cation vacancies triggered charge disproportionation to form high&#8208;activity Ni4+, resulting in facilitating deprotonation in a lattice oxygen involved catalytic process.







Abstract
Despite the fact that high&#8208;valent nickel&#8208;based oxides exhibit promising catalytic activity for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), the fundamental questions concerning the origin of the high performance and the structure&#8211;activity correlations remain to be elucidated. Here, we unveil the underlying enhanced mechanism of UOR by employing a series of prepared cation&#8208;vacancy controllable LiNiO2 (LNO) model catalysts. Impressively, the optimized layered LNO&#8208;2 exhibits an extremely low overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 along with excellent stability after the 160&#8197;h test. Operando characterisations combined with the theoretical analysis reveal the activated lattice oxygen in layered LiNiO2 with moderate cation vacancies triggers charge disproportion of the Ni site to form Ni4+ species, facilitating deprotonation in a lattice oxygen involved catalytic process.

         <title>Water Networks Repopulate Protein&#8211;Ligand Interfaces with Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cryo&#8208;cooled water molecules block protein motions that impact protein&#8211;ligand interactions. Paired cryo and room&#8208;temperature comparisons of ligand&#8208;bound Hsp90&#945; structures show that water networks and protein conformations are more mobile at room temperature. Revealing such alternate conformational states that are masked by cryo&#8208;cooling provides new insights towards drug discovery.







Abstract
High&#8208;resolution crystal structures highlight the importance of water networks in protein&#8211;ligand interactions. However, as these are typically determined at cryogenic temperature, resulting insights may be structurally precise but not biologically accurate. By collecting 10 matched room&#8208;temperature and cryogenic datasets of the biomedical target Hsp90&#945;, we identified changes in water networks that impact protein conformations at the ligand binding interface. Water repositioning with temperature repopulates protein ensembles and ligand interactions. We introduce Flipper conformational barcodes to identify temperature&#8208;sensitive regions in electron density maps. This revealed that temperature&#8208;responsive states coincide with ligand&#8208;responsive regions and capture unique binding signatures that disappear upon cryo&#8208;cooling. Our results have implications for discovering Hsp90 selective ligands, and, more generally, for the utility of hidden protein and water conformations in drug discovery.

         <title>A Deep Eutectic Solvent Thermomorphic Multiphasic System for Biocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The applicability of a deep eutectic solvent thermomorphic multiphasic system (DES&#8208;TMS) within biocatalysis was successfully demonstrated. Horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase was simply recycled using the DES&#8208;TMS. At increased temperatures, the system splits into an aqueous&#8208;enriched and a DES&#8208;enriched phase. In this way, the product and the catalyst were separated in a single unit operation step.







Abstract
The applicability of a thermomorphic multiphasic system (TMS) composed of a hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent (DES) and an aqueous potassium phosphate buffer with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) phase change for homogeneous biocatalysis was investigated. A lidocaine&#8208;based DES with the fatty acid oleic acid as a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor was studied. Phase diagrams were determined and presented within this study. We tested different additional components to the solvent system and observed a decrease in the cloud point of approximately 0.026&#8201;&#176;C per concentration unit. Distribution studies revealed a clear distribution of the protein in the aqueous buffer phase (&gt;95&#8201;%), whereas the hydrophobic substrate and educt accumulated (&gt;95&#8201;%) in the DES&#8208;enriched layer. Finally, a reduction catalyzed by horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase was performed in a larger&#8208;scale experiment, and the biocatalyst could be recycled by simply removing the DES phase for three recycling runs.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Geminal Hydroborative Cyclization of Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different from the previously known hydroborative cyclizations that add hydrogen and boron to opposite sides of an enyne, the proper choice of a ruthenium catalyst alters this propensity to a new addition mode, geminal hydroborative cyclopropanation. Two possible mechanisms are operative, which are substrate&#8208;dependent based on DFT studies.







Abstract
Disclosed here is the first geminal (gem&#8208;) hydroborative cyclization of enynes. Different from known hydroborative cyclizations, this process adds hydrogen and boron to the same position, leading to a new reaction mode. With [Cp*RuCl]4 as catalyst, a range of gem&#8208;hydroborated bicyclic products bearing a cyclopropane unit could be rapidly assembled from simple enyne substrates. Control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided important insights into the reaction mechanism. Notably, two major competing pathways may operate with substrate&#8208;dependence. 1,6&#8208;Enynes favor initial oxidative cyclometalation to form a ruthenacyclopentene intermediate prior to engaging hydroborane, while other enynes (e.g., 1,7&#8208;enynes) that lack strong propensity toward cyclization prefer initial alkyne gem&#8208;(H,B)&#8208;addition to form an &#945;&#8208;boryl ruthenium carbene followed by intramolecular olefin cyclopropanation. This process also represents the first ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enyne hydroborative cyclization.

         <title>Restoration of the Immunogenicity of Tumor Cells for Enhanced Cancer Therapy via Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Copper Chaperone Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination strategy for synergistic chemo&#8208;sensitization and conversion of tumor cells into vaccines triggers an intense immune response through copper chaperone inhibition with multifunctional nanoparticles loaded with cisplatin prodrugs and DC_AC50 conjugated to reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive polymers.







Abstract
Recent progress in studying copper&#8208;dependent targets and pathways in the context of tumor treatment has provided new insights into therapeutic strategies of leveraging copper&#8208;dependent disease vulnerabilities and pharmacological manipulation of intratumor copper transportation to improve chemotherapy. Here, we developed reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles loaded with copper chaperone inhibitor DC_AC50 and cisplatin(IV) prodrug. The released DC_AC50 can promote a remarkable accumulation of intracellular cisplatin and copper through inhibition of the Atox1&#8208;ATPase pathways, thereby enhancing the chemotherapeutic effect of cisplatin and inducing significant ROS generation. Excessive ROS then elicits intense endoplasmic reticulin (ER) stress which facilitates the immunogenic cell death (ICD) spurring a sustained immune response. Our study suggests that nanoparticle&#8208;mediated copper chaperone inhibition via DC_AC50 can restore the immunogenicity of tumor cells for enhanced chemotherapy and cancer immunotherapy.

Tandem catalysis of solid NaPr&#8208;CoRu@Al2O3 and molecular [HCo(CO)3PR3] catalysts allows the direct conversion of synthesis gas to alcohols. Walter Leitner, Andreas&#8197;J. Vorholt, Gonzalo Prieto et&#8197;al. show in their Research Article (e202201004) that the combination of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch and hydroformylation catalysts generates alcohols from synthesis gas with exceptional selectivity. While the bimodally porous solid catalyst generates 1&#8208;olefins with high efficiency, in situ hydroformylation of olefins to alcohols circumvents secondary hydrogenation and allows to push the alcohol selectivity even further.

The reaction path of the Lewis acid catalyzed intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition to form a C3 ammonium enolate is reported by Jan Paradies et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202204378). This transient intermediate rearranges diastereospecifically to the tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;4&#8208;one scaffold. The central structure in the picture represents the transition state of the diastereospecific sigmatropic [1,5] carbon shift which proceeds with retention of configuration on the migrating carbon center.

Rapid and reagent&#8208;free pathogen tests are urgently needed. In their Research Article (e202204252), Leyla Soleymani, Yingfu Li and co&#8208;workers developed a dual&#8208;electrode electrochemical chip (DEE&#8208;Chip) and a barcode&#8208;releasing electroactive aptamer for rapid on&#8208;farm detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDv). In contrast to current biosecurity surveillance with turnaround times of 2&#8211;4 days, this technology identifies infection with PEDv in pig saliva in one hour with a diagnostic sensitivity of 100&#8201;% and specificity of 83&#8201;%.

         <title>Stepping Out of the Blue: From Visible to Near&#8208;IR Triggered Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red&#8208;shifted photoswitches are in high demand and have sparked great research interest in the past decade. In this Review, we highlight recent progress towards the development of visible&#8208; and NIR&#8208;activated photoswitches characterized by distinct photochromic reaction mechanisms. We evaluate the pros and cons of each type based on their photochromic properties and conclude with a perspective on how the field may develop in the future.







Abstract
Light offers unique opportunities for controlling the activity of materials and biosystems with high spatiotemporal resolution. Molecular photoswitches are chromophores that undergo reversible isomerization between different states upon irradiation with light, allowing a convenient means to control their influence over the system of interest. However, a significant limitation of classical photoswitches is the requirement to initiate the switching in one or both directions using deleterious UV light with poor tissue penetration. Red&#8208;shifted photoswitches are hence in high demand and have attracted keen recent research interest. In this Review, we highlight recent progress towards the development of visible&#8208; and NIR&#8208;activated photoswitches characterized by distinct photochromic reaction mechanisms. We hope to inspire further endeavors in this field, allowing the full potential of these tools in biotechnology and materials chemistry applications to be realized.

Recent advances in photochemical C&#8722;H functionalization reactions using a single metal catalyst to enable sustainable strategies for the functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds under ambient conditions without an external photosensitizer are highlighted in this Minireview. Reaction mechanisms and the role of visible light are described, and future perspectives and challenges to stimulate future research directions in the field of light&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H functionalization are discussed.







Abstract
C&#8722;H functionalization represents one of the most rapidly advancing areas in organic synthesis and is regarded as one of the key concepts to minimize the ecological and economic footprint of organic synthesis. The ubiquity and low reactivity of C&#8722;H bonds in organic molecules, however, poses several challenges, and often necessitates harsh reaction conditions to achieve this goal, although it is highly desirable to achieve C&#8722;H functionalization reactions under mild conditions. Recently, several reports uncovered a conceptually new approach towards C&#8722;H functionalization, where a single transition&#8208;metal complex can be used as both the photosensitizer and catalyst to promote C&#8722;H bond functionalization in the absence of an exogeneous photosensitizer. In this Minireview, we will provide an overview on recent achievements in C&#8722;H functionalization reactions, with an emphasis on the photochemical modulation of the reaction mechanism using such catalysts.

         <title>Oxidative Fluorination of Heteroatoms Enabled by Trichloroisocyanuric Acid and Potassium Fluoride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative fluorination of various Group 15, 16, and 17 heteroatoms in organic scaffolds was made significantly more accessible in recent years using potassium fluoride and trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCICA)&#8212;a common swimming pool disinfectant. Behind&#8208;the&#8208;scenes insight and discussion on discoveries, applications, and opportunities associated with this &#8220;TCICA/KF approach&#8221; are chronicled herein.







Abstract
In synthetic method development, the most rewarding path is seldom a straight line. While our initial entry into pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5) chemistry did not go according to plan (due to inaccessibility of reagents such as SF5Cl at the time), a &#8220;detour&#8221; led us to establish mild and inexpensive oxidative fluorination conditions that made aryl&#8208;SF5 compound synthesis more accessible. The method involved the use of potassium fluoride and trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCICA)&#8212;a common swimming pool disinfectant&#8212;as opposed to previously employed reagents such as F2, XeF2, HF, and Cl2. Thereafter, curiosity led us to explore applications of TCICA/KF as a more general approach to the synthesis of fluorinated Group 15, 16, and 17 heteroatoms in organic scaffolds; this, in turn, prompted SC&#8208;XRD, VT&#8208;NMR, computational, and physical organic studies. Ultimately, it was discovered that TCICA/KF can be used to synthesize SF5Cl, enabling SF5 chemistry in an unexpected way.

Ultimately, it was discovered that TCICA/KF can be used to synthesize SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl, enabling SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; chemistry in an unexpected way.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Planar Five&#8208;Membered Aromatic Ring Stabilized by Only Two &#960;&#8208;Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although doubted in the past, two &#960;&#8208;electrons are just enough to stabilize five&#8208;membered aromatic compounds that are even stable at room&#8208;temperature, as shown by the facile synthesis of a dipotassium cyclopentagallene. This compound is a unique example of a five&#8208;membered aromatic ring stabilized by only two &#960;&#8208;electrons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed a planar Ga5 ring with almost equal gallium&#8211;gallium bond lengths.







Abstract
Many chemicals known today are partially or fully aromatic, since a ring framework experiences additional stabilization through the delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons. While aromatic rings with equal numbers of &#960;&#8208;electrons and ring atoms such as benzene are particularly stable, those with the minimally required two &#960;&#8208;electrons are very rare and yet remain limited to three&#8208; and four&#8208;membered rings if not stabilized in the coordination sphere of heavy metals. Here we report the facile synthesis of a dipotassium cyclopentagallene, a unique example of a five&#8208;membered aromatic ring stabilized by only two &#960;&#8208;electrons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed a planar Ga5 ring with almost equal gallium&#8211;gallium bond lengths, which together with computational and spectroscopic data confirm its aromatic character. Our results prove that aromatic stabilization goes far beyond what has previously been assumed as minimum &#960;&#8208;electron count in a five&#8208;atom ring fragment.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Complex Peptidyl Nucleoside Antibiotics: Asymmetric De Novo Syntheses of Miharamycin&#8197;B and Its Biosynthetic Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple building blocks were used for the total synthesis of miharamycin&#8197;B and its biosynthetic precursor. The key step in the strategy was the de novo construction of the pyranose moiety through Achmatowicz rearrangement. The purine ring was introduced by palladium&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;glycosylation.







Abstract
Miharamycins belong to a class of peptidyl nucleoside antibiotics with a unique nine&#8208;carbon pyranosyl amino acid core and a rare 2&#8208;aminopurine moiety. Herein, we report the de novo total synthesis of miharamycin&#8197;B and its biosynthetic precursor from 3&#8208;bromofuran and Garner's aldehyde through a modified Achmatowicz reaction. Many challenges were resolved toward the de novo synthesis of miharamycin&#8197;B, including the introduction of a dense array of functional groups, the stereoselective construction of consecutive stereocenters, dealing with the variability of the anomeric positions, and promoting site&#8208;selectivity in the cyclization to form the tetrahydrofuran ring. This de novo synthesis strategy enables efficient preparation of 3&#8242;&#8208;substituted saccharides, allowing the study of their structure&#8211;activity relationships and mode of action, and meets the growing demand for the development of novel antibiotics inspired by miharamycin natural products.

         <title>Sigmatropic [1,5] Carbon Shift of Transient C3 Ammonium Enolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of a new [1,5] sigmatropic rearrangement is described. With the aid of a borane&#8208;based Lewis acid, the transiently generated C3 ammonium enolates undergo a sigmatropic [1,5] shift of benzylic, allylic and propargylic groups to provide access to trans&#8208;configured tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;4&#8208;ones with diastereoselectivity of &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1. The reaction is investigated in kinetic, mechanistic and computational experiments.







Abstract
The stereospecific sigmatropic [1,5] carbon shift of C3 ammonium enolates is discovered. According to mechanistic, kinetic and computational experiments, this new rearrangement proceeds via the catalytic generation of a transient C3 ammonium enolate by intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition. This intermediate rapidly undergoes [1,5] sigmatropic carbon migration to furnish the respective tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;4&#8208;ones with excellent diastereoselectivities of d.r. &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 and in 61&#8211;98&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Synthesis of an N&#8208;Heterocylic Boryl&#8208;Stabilized Disilyne and Its Application to the Activation of Dihydrogen and C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first N&#8208;heterocyclic boryl&#8208;stabilized disilyne has been prepared and structurally characterized. The disilyne compound enabled the activation of dihydrogen and the benzylic C&#8722;H bond from toluene without the need for a catalyst, highlighting the unique electronic effects of the boryl group on the properties of low&#8208;valent silicon species.







Abstract
The synthesis of low&#8208;valent silicon compounds that enable the activation of small molecules has been of great current interest. Reduction of N&#8208;heterocyclic boryltribromosilane (NHB)SiBr3 (2, NHB=[ArN(CMe)2NAr]B, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with three equiv. of lithium in diethyl ether yielded the NHB&#8208;stabilized disilyne (NHB)Si&#8801;Si(NHB) (3). Disilyne 3 slowly reacted with toluene, leading to the activation of one benzylic C&#8722;H bond and one C=C double bond with the formation of 4. Treatment of 3 with dihydrogen under 1&#8197;atm at room temperature resulted in the exclusive formation of the first boryl&#8208;stabilized 1,2&#8208;dihydrodisilene. Compounds 3&#8211;5 have been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, which indicated the co&#8208;planarity of the B&#8722;Si&#8722;Si&#8722;B plane with the NHB rings in compounds 3 and 5. DFT calculations indicated the significant &#960; electron delocalization of the Si&#8722;Si multiple bonds to the B&#8722;N bonds in NHB rings.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction through Hydrophobic Microenvironment and Binuclear Cobalt Synergistic Effect in Metallogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallogels based on the co&#8208;assembly of L&#8208;glutamic acid lipids with cobalt ions can be used as catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction presenting high efficiency and good product selectivity. Mimicking the natural lipid bilayer not only provides these soft matter catalysts with a hydrophobic microenvironment and binuclear synergistic effect but also renders them environmentally friendly with recycling and degradable properties.







Abstract
Assemblies that mimic natural lipid bilayers are theoretically efficient for photocatalytic CO2 reduction; however, such an approach has not been yet explored. Herein, metallogels (LG/Nico&#8208;Co) based on the co&#8208;assembly of L&#8208;glutamic acid lipid (LG/Nico) and cobalt ions exhibited excellent photocatalytic CO2 reduction, with 208&#8201;724&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 CO production within 24&#8197;h and 90&#8201;% CO/H2 selectivity, or 166&#8201;826&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 CO production within 12&#8197;h and 46&#8201;% CO/H2 selectivity, depending on the water content of the solvent. The alkyl chains of LG/Nico provide a hydrophobic microenvironment for efficient gas transfer, and the assembled bilayers induce a synergistic effect between two adjacent Co ions for catalyzing the CO2 reduction reaction. These architectures present new alternatives for the development of highly efficient photocatalytic soft matter based on the assembly of small amphiphilic molecules.

&lt;p&gt;Metallogels based on the co-assembly of L-glutamic acid lipids with cobalt ions can be used as catalysts for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction presenting high efficiency and good product selectivity. Mimicking the natural lipid bilayer not only provides these soft matter catalysts with a hydrophobic microenvironment and binuclear synergistic effect but also renders them environmentally friendly with recycling and degradable properties.

         <title>Fluorescence or Phosphorescence? The Metallic Composition of the Nanocluster Kernel Does Matter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metallic compositions of nanoclusters can dictate whether their photoluminescence is fluorescence or phosphorescence. This effect is demonstrated with Au5Ag11 and Pt1Ag16 nanoclusters that have comparable structures but different compositions.







Abstract
It remains challenging to manipulate the nature of photoluminescence as either fluorescence or phosphorescence for a correlated cluster series. In this work, two correlated nanoclusters, Au5Ag11(SR)8(DPPOE)2 and Pt1Ag16(SR)8(DPPOE)2 with comparable structure features, were synthesized and structurally determined. These two alloy nanoclusters displayed distinct photoluminescent nature&#8212;the Au5Ag11 nanocluster is fluorescent, whereas the Pt1Ag16 nanocluster is phosphorescent. The decay processes of the excited electrons in these two nanoclusters have been explicitly mapped out by both experimental and theoretical approaches, disclosing the mechanisms of their fluorescence and phosphorescence. Specifically, the metallic compositions of the nanocluster kernels mattered in determining their photoluminescent nature. The results herein provide an intriguing nanomodel that enables us to grasp the origin of photoluminescence at the atomic level, which further paves the way for fabricating novel nanoclusters or cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials with customized photophysical properties.

         <title>Exploring Equilibria between Aluminium(I) and Aluminium(III): The Formation of Dihydroalanes, Masked Dialumenes and Aluminium(I) Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monomeric AlI compound is used as a stoichiometric reducing agent towards a series of AlIII dihydrides. This leads to the formation of new low oxidation state species including symmetric and asymmetric dihydrodialanes, and a masked dialumene. The transient formation of new, previously inaccessible AlI species is demonstrated through reactivity studies and theory.







Abstract
The design of new reductive routes to low oxidation state aluminium (Al) compounds offers the opportunity to better understand redox processes at the metal centre and develop reactivity accordingly. Here, a monomeric AlI compound acts as a stoichiometric reducing agent towards a series of AlIII dihydrides, leading to the formation of new low oxidation state species including symmetric and asymmetric dihydrodialanes, and a masked dialumene. These compounds are formed by a series of equilibrium processes involving AlI, AlII and AlIII species and product formation can be manipulated by fine&#8208;tuning the reaction conditions. The transient formation of monomeric AlI compounds is proposed: this is shown to be energetically viable by computational (DFT) investigations and reactivity studies show support for the formation of AlI species. Importantly, despite the potential for the equilibrium mixtures to lead to ill&#8208;defined reactivity, controlled reactivity of these low oxidation state species is observed.

Photodegradable, recyclable, and renewable crosslinked polymers from bioresources show promise towards developing a sustainable strategy to address the issue of plastic degradability and recyclability.







Abstract
Photodegradable, recyclable, and renewable, crosslinked polymers from bioresources show promise towards developing a sustainable strategy to address the issue of plastics degradability and recyclability. Photo processes are not widely exploited for upcycling polymers in spite of the potential to have spatial and temporal control of the degradation in addition to being a green process. In this report we highlight a methodology in which biomass&#8208;derived crosslinked polymers can be programmed to degrade at &#8776;300&#8197;nm with &#8776;60&#8201;% recovery of the monomer. The recovered monomer was recycled back to the crosslinked polymer.

         <title>Green&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Reductive Elimination of Chlorine from a Carbene&#8208;Xanthylium Gold(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complex combining an ambiphilic carbene/xanthylium ligand and a gold trichloride supports the efficient green&#8208;light&#8208;induced extrusion of chlorine radicals en route to the corresponding gold(I) complex. The photolability of this gold(III) complex originates from excitation of a carbene/xanthylium donor/acceptor dyad, the excited state of which challenges the inherent stability of the gold(III) moiety.







Abstract
With the discovery of late transition metal platforms that support clean photoreductive halogen eliminations, we now describe an indazol&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene gold trichloride complex ([7]+) decorated at the 4&#8208;position by a xanthylium unit. This orange complex features a low energy band in the visible part of the spectrum, assigned to the charge transfer excitation of the indazol&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene/xanthylium donor/acceptor dyad. Green&#8208;light irradiation of this complex in the presence of a chlorine trap elicits the clean photoelimination of chlorine radicals, producing the corresponding gold(I) complex. This visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoreduction is very efficient, reaching quantum yields close to 10&#8201;%. A neutral analog of [7]+ featuring an anthryl group rather than a xanthylium unit proved to be perfectly photostable, supporting the importance of the xanthylium&#8208;based photoredox unit present in [7]+.

         <title>Umpolung AlaB Reagents for the Synthesis of Non&#8208;Proteogenic Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel amino acid synthon in the form of boronoalanine (AlaB) suitable for umpolung peptide/protein functionalization is described. It is demonstrated that AlaB can be incorporated into peptides and proteins, and remains stable under solid&#8208;phase synthesis, native chemical ligation, and radical desulfurization. Furthermore, AlaB is a competent partner in inter(intra)molecular C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
Non&#8208;proteogenic amino acids and functionalized peptides are important motifs in modern drug discovery. Here we report that AlaB can serve as universal building blocks in the synthesis of a diverse collection of modified amino acids, peptides, and proteins. First, we develop the synthesis of AlaB from redox&#8208;active esters of aspartic acid resulting in a series of &#946;&#8208;boronoalanine derivatives. Next, we show that AlaB can be integrated into automated oligopeptide solid&#8208;phase synthesis. AlaB is compatible with common transformations used in preparative peptide chemistry such as native chemical ligation and radical desulfurization as showcased by total synthesis of AlaB&#8208;containing ubiquitin. Furthermore, AlaB reagents participate in Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions, including C&#8722;C cross&#8208;couplings and macrocyclizations. Taken together, AlaB synthons are practical reagents to access modified peptides, proteins, and in the synthesis of cyclic/stapled peptides.

         <title>Intramolecular Energy and Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chirality Transfer within a BINOL&#8208;Perylene Hetero&#8208;Cyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) hetero&#8208;cyclophane comprising a chiral binaphthol bisimide (BBI) dye and a dynamically racemic PBI dye shows quantitative energy and solvent&#8208;dependent chirality transfer among its components, thereby leading to an amplified bright red circularly polarized luminescence from PBI.







Abstract
Multichromophoric macrocycles and cyclophanes are important supramolecular architectures for the elucidation of interchromophoric interactions originating from precise spatial organization. Herein, by combining an axially chiral binaphthol bisimide (BBI) and a bay&#8208;substituted conformationally labile twisted perylene bisimide (PBI) within a cyclophane of well&#8208;defined geometry, we report a chiral PBI hetero&#8208;cyclophane (BBI&#8208;PBI) that shows intramolecular energy and solvent&#8208;regulated chirality transfer from the BBI to the PBI subunit. Excellent spectral overlap and spatial arrangement of BBI and PBI lead to efficient excitation energy transfer and subsequent PBI emission with high quantum yield (80&#8211;98&#8201;%) in various solvents. In contrast, chirality transfer is strongly dependent on the respective solvent as revealed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The combination of energy and chirality transfer affords a bright red circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from the PBI chromophore by excitation of BBI.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of a Fluorinated&#8208;Squaramide Covalent Organic Framework for the Highly Efficient and Broad&#8208;Spectrum Removal of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
At the intersection of molecular recognition and materials science, a multi&#8208;functional two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) is prepared and applied as a broad&#8208;spectrum adsorbent for the high&#8208;efficiency removal of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl pollutants.







Abstract
The escalating contamination by per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has become an urgent issue in recent years, and the structural diversity of PFAS is the major challenge for effective pollution control. Herein, we take the intrinsic advantages of squaramide and prepare a new two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (FSQ&#8208;1) that exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum PFAS affinity. The tailor&#8208;made linker forges hydrogen&#8208;bond donors, hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors, and fluorophilic segments into one framework. The obtained material exhibits multipoint and multitype affinity to PFAS with different structures, by which high&#8208;efficient and broad&#8208;spectrum removal of various PFAS can be simultaneously achieved. Notably, the thermodynamic profiles provided by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments further illustrate the underlying mechanism of the broad&#8208;spectrum affinity. FSQ&#8208;1 can also be applied for efficient PFAS extraction in trace&#8208;level PFAS analysis.

         <title>Accelerated Degradation of Microplastics at the Liquid Interface of Ice Crystals in Frozen Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptionally rapid degradation of microplastics (MPs) in frozen solution was discovered. The activity is ascribed to selective generation of singlet oxygen in the narrow space of the liquid layer between ice crystals. The findings offer a highly efficient degradation pathway for MPs and shed light on mechanisms of disposal of MPs in nature.







Abstract
Microplastics (MPs) are one of the emerging contaminants in environmental media, and they have raised great concern because they are resistant to degradation and persist in ecosystems. Although numerous advanced technologies have been developed, suitable technologies are still lacking for degradation of widespread MPs in the natural environment. We have discovered that MPs can be degraded exceptionally rapidly in frozen environments. Taking polystyrene (PS) as an example, its degradation rate in ice (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C) is surprisingly competitive to most artificial technologies. PS particles are trapped and squeezed to achieve excited state (3PS*) in the narrow space of the liquid layer between ice crystals, which further react with the highly concentrated dioxygen to selectively produce singlet oxygen (1O2). The 1O2 boosts PS oxidation in the liquid layer thus further causing accelerated degradation at freezing temperature. This finding offers a highly efficient pathway for degradation of MPs and it sheds light on an unusual MPs disposal mechanisms in nature.

         <title>Native Ambient Mass Spectrometry of an Intact Membrane Protein Assembly and Soluble Protein Assemblies Directly from Lens Tissue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integral membrane protein assembly Aquaporin&#8208;0 was analysed by native ambient mass spectrometry of eye lens tissue. Membrane protein assemblies were solubilised by detergent micelles. Spatially&#8208;resolved analysis for mapping protein assembly distributions, accurate intact mass determination, and the identification of assemblies approx. 100&#8197;kDa in molecular weight are demonstrated.







Abstract
Membrane proteins constitute around two&#8208;thirds of therapeutic targets but present a significant challenge for structural analysis due to their low abundance and solubility. Existing methods for structural analysis rely on over&#8208;expression and/or purification of the membrane protein, thus removing any links back to actual physiological environment. Here, we demonstrate mass spectrometry analysis of an intact oligomeric membrane protein directly from tissue. Aquaporin&#8208;0 exists as a 113&#8197;kDa tetramer, with each subunit featuring six transmembrane helices. We report the characterisation of the intact assembly directly from a section of sheep eye lens without sample pre&#8208;treatment. Protein identity was confirmed by mass measurement of the tetramer and subunits, together with top&#8208;down mass spectrometry, and the spatial distribution was determined by mass spectrometry imaging. Our approach allows simultaneous analysis of soluble protein assemblies in the tissue.

Simple and readily available alkyl sulfoxides are shown to be suitable precursors to radicals. Alkyl sulfoxides, N&#8208;methoxy pyridinium salts and fluoride anions form electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes, which, upon visible&#8208;light irradiation, undergo a radical chain process to give various pyridine derivatives.







Abstract
We report here the use of simple and readily available alkyl sulfoxides as precursors to radicals and their application in the preparation of pyridine derivatives. We show that alkyl sulfoxides, N&#8208;methoxy pyridinium salts and fluoride anions form electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes in solution, which, upon visible light irradiation, undergo a radical chain process to afford various pyridine derivatives smoothly. This reaction displays broad scope with respect to both sulfoxides and N&#8208;methoxy pyridiniums. The synthetic versatility of sulfoxides as a handle in chemistry adds to their power as radical precursors. Glycosyl sulfoxides are converted to the corresponding pyridyl C&#8208;glycosides with high stereoselectivities. Computational and experimental studies provide insights into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>A Novel AgI&#8208;DNA Rod Comprising a One&#8208;Dimensional Array of 11 Silver Ions within a Double Helical Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel AgI&#8208;DNA rod comprising a one&#8208;dimensional array of 11 silver ions within a double&#8208;helical structure was obtained by mixing an oligonucleotide and silver ions in appropriate solutions. Furthermore, formations of the rod structure in solutions were determined by UV/Vis, CD, NMR, and mass spectrometry.







Abstract
DNA/RNA duplexes containing metal&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated base pairs (metallo&#8208;base pairs) have potential applications in developing nucleic acid&#8208;based nanodevices and genetic code expansion. Many metallo&#8208;base pairs are formed within duplexes stabilized by Watson&#8211;Crick base pairs. Recently, the crystal structure of an AgI&#8208;DNA nanowire with an uninterrupted one&#8208;dimensional silver array was determined. Here, we present a new DNA helical wire, the &#8220;AgI&#8208;DNA rod&#8221;, containing an uninterrupted array of 11&#8197;AgI ions. The AgI&#8208;DNA rod consisted of only C&#8208;AgI&#8208;C, G&#8208;AgI&#8208;G, G&#8208;AgI&#8208;5&#8208;bromouracil (BrU), and BrU&#8208;AgI&#8208;BrU metallo base pairs, with no Watson&#8211;Crick pairs. The AgI&#8208;DNA rods were connected by non&#8208;canonical G&#8211;G pairs in crystals. Notably, data from our absorbance, circular dichroism, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry analyses suggested that the AgI&#8208;DNA rods formed in solution, as well as within crystals.

         <title>Sirtuin&#8208;Derived Covalent Binder for the Selective Recognition of Protein Crotonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering a bacterial sirtuin deacetylase with thiol&#8208;bearing noncanonical amino acids, a selective and robust covalent binder for lysine crotonylation on proteins was developed, and features a unique NAD+ dependency.







Abstract
Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is increasingly recognized as a key protein post&#8208;translational modification. However, selective detection and enrichment of crotonylated proteins remains a challenging task. Herein we present a covalent binder for the selective recognition of protein crotonylation. Based on proximity&#8208;induced crosslinking, a bacterial sirtuin (CobB) was remodeled with genetically installed thiol&#8208;bearing noncanonical amino acids at the Kcr&#8208;interacting site, which subsequently could react with Kcr sites in a unique NAD+&#8208;dependent manner. The covalent binder has been used to selectively recognize crotonylated proteins in extracted histone samples and in fixed cells.

         <title>Metathesis Reactions of a NHC&#8208;Stabilized Phosphaborene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable compounds with a genuine B=P double bond are rare and have limited applications given their protecting groups&#8242; bulky nature. The preparation of a Lewis base&#8208;stabilized phosphaborene with a B=P double bond and a trimethylsilyl (TMS) functionality at the P&#8208;terminal is reported, which exhibits an unprecedented ability for B=P&#8208;unit transfer reactions, allowing the isolation of B=P&#8208;containing compounds.







Abstract
The BP unsaturated unit is a very attractive functional group as it provides novel reactivity and unique physical properties. Nonetheless, applications remain limited so far due to the bulky nature of B/P&#8208;protecting groups, required to prevent oligomerization. Herein, we report the synthesis and isolation of a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized phosphaborene, bearing a trimethylsilyl (TMS) functionality at the P&#8208;terminal, as a room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable crystalline solid accessible via facile NHC&#8208;induced trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) elimination from its phosphinoborane precursor. This phosphaborene compound, bearing a genuine B=P bond, exhibits a remarkable ability for undergoing P&#8208;centre metathesis reactions, which allows the isolation of a series of unprecedented phosphaborenes. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and DFT calculations provide insights into the B=P bonding situation.

         <title>Formal &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation of Aldehydes and Ketones by Cooperative Nickel and Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formal &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H (hetero)arylation of aldehydes and ketones via their readily prepared silyl enol ethers has been achieved by dual nickel and photoredox catalysis. This reaction features broad scope and excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H&#8208;functionalization of ketones and aldehydes has been intensively explored in organic synthesis. The functionalization of unactivated &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds in such carbonyl compounds is less well investigated and developing a general method for their &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation remains challenging. Herein we report a method that uses cooperative nickel and photoredox catalysis for the formal &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of aldehydes and ketones with (hetero)aryl bromides. The method features mild conditions, remarkable scope and wide functional group tolerance. Importantly, the introduced synthetic strategy also allows the &#946;&#8208;alkenylation, &#946;&#8208;alkynylation and &#946;&#8208;acylation of aldehydes under similar conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed that this transformation proceeds through a single electron oxidation/Ni&#8208;mediated coupling/reductive elimination cascade.

         <title>A Modular Approach for Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;trans&#8208;Disubstituted Tetrahydroisoquinolines: Seven&#8208;Step Asymmetric Synthesis of Michellamines&#8197;B and C</title>

         <dc:description>
A modular and step&#8208;economical approach based on a three&#8208;component Catellani reaction and a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/reduction cascade has been established for the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of 1,3&#8208;trans&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydroisoquinolines. This synthetic strategy enabled concise syntheses of an analogue of the new drug mevidalen as well as four naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;trans&#8208;Disubstituted tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) is a common heterocyclic structural unit of naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids. The assembly of this structural unit is not trivial, which constitutes a substantial challenge in the total synthesis of naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids and related pharmaceuticals. Herein, we report a modular and convergent method for the rapid assembly of 1,3&#8208;trans&#8208;disubstituted THIQ frameworks through a three&#8208;component Catellani reaction and a AuI&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/reduction cascade. With widely available simple aryl iodides, aziridines and (triisopropylsilyl)acetylene as the building blocks, this method paves a practical way for the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of 1,3&#8208;trans&#8208;disubstituted THIQs. Based on this new method, concise syntheses of an analogue of the new drug mevidalen and four naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids have been accomplished, demonstrating the broad synthetic utility of this approach.

         <title>Reductive Carbon&#8211;Carbon Coupling on Metal Sites Regulates Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Water Using ZnSe Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive carbon&#8211;carbon coupling was used to block H2 evolution in CO2 photoreduction in water. Furfural, one of the biomass platform molecules, adsorbs on Zn&#8208;sites consuming electrons and protons originally used for H2 production, but the CO formation pathway at surface anion vacancies remains. Therefore, CO was evolved with a CO/H2 ratio of 265&#8201;:&#8201;1 in the gas phase and furfural was upgraded to value&#8208;added hydrofuroin.







Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) consisting of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free elements show attractive potentials towards solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. However, the inhibition of hydrogen (H2) production in aqueous solution remains a challenge. Here, we describe the first example of a carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) coupling reaction to block the competing H2 evolution in photocatalytic CO2 reduction in water. In a specific system taking ZnSe QDs as photocatalysts, the introduction of furfural can significantly suppress H2 evolution leading to CO evolution with a rate of &#8776;5.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a turnover number (TON) of &gt;7500 under 24&#8197;h visible light. Meanwhile, furfural is upgraded to the self&#8208;coupling product with a yield of 99.8&#8201;% based on the consumption of furfural. Mechanistic insights show that the reductive furfural coupling reaction occurs on surface Zn&#8208;sites to consume electrons and protons originally used for H2 production, while the CO formation pathway at surface anion vacancies from CO2 remains.

         <title>Preparation of Functionalized Amides Using Dicarbamoylzincs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyfunctional dicarbamoylzincs of type (R1R2NCO)2Zn were prepared in THF by treating a mixture of formamides and ZnCl2 with LiTMP (THF, 15&#8201;&#176;C, 15&#8197;min) or by reacting formamides with TMP2Zn (THF, 25&#8201;&#176;C, 16&#8197;h). These zinc reagents reacted with allylic, benzylic, aryl and alkenyl bromides, acid chlorides, aldehydes or enones providing various amides in 47&#8211;97&#8201;% yields. 13C NMR data showed a characteristic carbonyl signal at 219.4&#8197;ppm for (Bu2NCO)2Zn.







Abstract
We report a new convenient preparation of dicarbamoylzincs of type (R1R2NCO)2Zn by the treatment of ZnCl2 and formamides R1R2NCHO with LiTMP in THF (15&#8201;&#176;C, 15&#8197;min) or by the reaction of formamides R1R2NCHO with TMP2Zn (25&#8201;&#176;C, 16&#8197;h). This second method tolerates sensitive groups such as an ester, ketone or nitro function. Reaction of these dicarbamoylzincs with allylic, benzylic, aryl, alkenyl bromides, acid chlorides, aldehydes or enones provided various polyfunctional amides in 47&#8211;97&#8201;% yields. 13C NMR characterization of these new carbamoylzinc derivatives is reported.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrocarbamoylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective hydrocarbamoylation of alkenes enabled by copper hydride and palladium cooperative catalysis was developed. Utilizing readily available carbamoyl chlorides, this method can be applied to various types of olefins, including alkenyl arenes, terminal alkenes, and 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, providing &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;chiral amides in good yields with excellent levels of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The asymmetric hydroaminocarbonylation of olefins represents a straightforward approach for the synthesis of enantioenriched amides, but is hampered by the necessity to employ CO gas, often at elevated pressures. We herein describe, as an alternative, an enantioselective hydrocarbamoylation of alkenes leveraging dual copper hydride and palladium catalysis to enable the use of readily available carbamoyl chlorides as a practical carbamoylating reagent. The protocol is applicable to various types of olefins, including alkenyl arenes, terminal alkenes, and 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes. Substrates containing a diverse range of functional groups as well as heterocyclic substructures undergo functionalization to provide &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;chiral amides in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities.

         <title>Synthesis of Si&#8208;Stereogenic Silanols by Catalytic Asymmetric Hydrolytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical method for the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols has been developed. This direct catalytic asymmetric hydrolytic oxidation of dihydrosilanes gives access to a variety of functionalized silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols, including bis&#8208;silanols, in high yields with excellent chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity under ambient conditions.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A practical method for the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of silicon-stereogenic silanols has been developed. This direct catalytic asymmetric hydrolytic oxidation of dihydrosilanes gives access to a variety of functionalized silicon-stereogenic silanols, including bis-silanols, in high yields with excellent chemo- and stereoselectivity under ambient conditions.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Cochlearol&#8197;B by an Approach Based on a Catellani Reaction and Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Enabled [2+2] Cycloaddition

A 14&#8208;step approach to (+)&#8208;cochlearol&#8197;B is reported. The strategy involves an organocatalytic Kabbe condensation, Catellani reaction, and visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated [2+2] cycloaddition to rapidly access the core of this natural product. Careful design and tuning of the Catellani and photocycloaddition reactions proved crucial in overcoming undesired reactivity, including cyclopropanation reactions, and [4+2] cycloadditions.







Abstract
A 14&#8208;step synthesis of (+)&#8208;cochlearol&#8197;B is reported. This renoprotective meroterpenoid features a unique core structure containing a densely substituted cyclobutane ring with three stereocenters. Our strategy employed an organocatalytic Kabbe condensation in route to the key chromenyl triflate. A subsequent Catellani reaction incorporated the remaining carbon atoms featured in the skeleton of cochlearol&#8197;B. An ensuing visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition closed the cyclobutane and formed the central bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane core. Notably, careful design and tuning of the Catellani and photocycloaddition reactions proved crucial in overcoming undesired reactivity, including cyclopropanation reactions and [4+2] cycloadditions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activated graphene&#8208;embedded Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 catalysts showed a remarkable nitrogen fixation apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 9.25&#8201;% under 365&#8197;nm light and high stability as solar nitrogen fertilizer. Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 is activated by the breakage of benzene&#8208;C bonds and forms effective active sites. Graphene embedding controlled bond breakages and improved photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Currently, nitrogen fertilizers feed half of the global population, but their use is limited by energy consumption and transportation. Therefore, it is important to study photocatalysts for use in solar nitrogen fertilizers. Herein, a new type of graphene&#8208;embedded Ce&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 (Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) photocatalyst (GSCe) is investigated. Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 is activated by the breakage of benzene&#8208;C bonds and the formation of active sites by ultraviolet light in water. Moreover, embedding graphene effectively controls activation and improves nitrogen fixation. GSCe exhibited a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 9.25&#8201;% and stability under 365&#8197;nm light with solar&#8208;level intensity. GSCe also performed well as a solar ammonia fertilizer for crop cultivation. This investigation opens up opportunities for nitrogen fixation photocatalysts to be used as environmentally friendly solar nitrogen fertilizers.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Promoted by a Ru1Cu Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) represents an elegant route toward sustainable value&#8208;added chemicals production that circumvents the use of fossil fuel and hydrogen. However, the reaction efficiency is hampered by the high voltage and low activity of electrodes (Cu, Bi, Pb). Herein, we report a Ru  1  Cu single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalyst with isolated Ru atoms on Cu nanowires that exhibits an electrochemical reduction of HMF to 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) with promoted productivity (0.47 vs. 0.08 mmol&#183;cm  &#8208;2  &#183;h  &#8208;1  ) and faradic efficiency (FE) (85.6 vs. 71.3%) at &#8208; 0.3 V (vs. RHE) compared with Cu counterpart. More importantly, the FE (87.5%) is largely retained at high HMF concentration (100 mM). Kinetic studies by using combined electrochemical techniques suggest disparate mechanisms over Ru  1  Cu and Cu, revealing that single&#8208;atom Ru promotes the dissociation of water to produce H* species that effectively react with HMF via an electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A General and Efficient Solution to Monofluoroalkylation: Divergent Synthesis of Aliphatic Monofluorides with Modular Synthetic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method allow preparation of diverse monofluorides based on the monofluoroalkyl triflate scaffold. Both nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydromonofluoroalkylation of unactivated alkenes and copper&#8208;catalyzed monofluoroalkylation of Grignard reagents were studied. Further utilities including conversion into conventional fluoroalkylating reagents and construction of monofluoro&#8208;alkoxy, &#8208;alkylamino motifs.







Abstract
Monofluoroalkanes are important in many pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and functional materials. However, the lack of easily available and transformable monofluoroalkylating reagents that facilitate a broad array of transformations has hampered the application of monofluoroalkylation. Herein, we report a general and efficient method of preparing diverse aliphatic monofluorides with monofluoroalkyl triflate as the synthetic scaffold. Using both nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydromonofluoroalkylation of unactivated alkenes and copper&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond formation, the general diversification of the monofluoroalkylating scaffold has been exhibited. The broad utility of this monofluoroalkylating reagent is shown by concise conversion into various conventional fluoroalkylating reagents and construction of monofluoro&#8208;alkoxy, &#8208;alkylamino motifs with commercially available heteroatom&#8208;based coupling partners.

         <title>Structural and Dynamic Analysis of Sulphur Dioxide Adsorption in a Series of Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework materials have been investigated for reversible SO2 uptake. The incorporation of atomically&#8208;dispersed CuII, amine or heteroatomic sulphur sites enhances the uptake of SO2 at low concentrations. This work confirms that control of pore environments is an important approach for optimising the adsorption of SO2 at low concentrations.







Abstract
We report reversible high capacity adsorption of SO2 in robust Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials. Zr&#8208;bptc (H4bptc=biphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid) shows a high SO2 uptake of 6.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K, reflecting excellent capture capability and removal of SO2 at low concentration (2500&#8197;ppm). Dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm that the introduction of amine, atomically&#8208;dispersed CuII or heteroatomic sulphur sites into the pores enhance the capture of SO2 at low concentrations. The captured SO2 can be converted quantitatively to a pharmaceutical intermediate, aryl N&#8208;aminosulfonamide, thus converting waste to chemical values. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared micro&#8208;spectroscopy and inelastic neutron scattering enable the visualisation of the binding domains of adsorbed SO2 molecules and host&#8211;guest binding dynamics in these materials at the atomic level. Refinement of the pore environment plays a critical role in designing efficient sorbent materials.

         <title>Red&#8208;Shifted Water&#8208;Soluble BODIPY Photocages for Visualisation and Controllable Cellular Delivery of Signaling Lipids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue&#8208;transparent red light&#160;is used to release oleic acid, a signaling lipid, into cells, which induces Ca2+&#160;oscillations accompanied by a turn&#8208;on fluorescence response. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202205855), Tom&#225;&#353; Slanina and co&#8208;workers show that &#960;&#8208;extended BODIPY photocages substituted with sulfonate groups can selectively target inner or outer membranes and release carboxylic acid upon red&#8208;light illumination.

         <title>para&#8208;Selective Radical Trifluoromethylation of Benzamide Derivatives via Iminium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of benzamide derivatives was developed that makes use of iminium intermediates. The iminium species, formed in situ from Tf2O, pyridine and amides, feature greatly enhanced reactivity at the para&#8208;position towards radical&#8208;type nucleophilic C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation.







Abstract
The direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arenes via a radical pathway has attracted considerable attention recently. However, a major challenge of C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation is the lack of site&#8208;selectivity on the phenyl ring especially para&#8208;selectivity. Herein we show a new strategy for para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of benzamide derivatives using iminium activation. The reaction undergoes a radical&#8208;type nucleophilic substitution instead of a radical&#8208;type electrophilic substitution owing to iminium activation as a result of lowering the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital). A wide range of substrates are compatible with this method giving almost exclusive para&#8208;trifluoromethylated products.

         <title>Phenacyl Bromide as a Single&#8208;Component Photoinitiator: Photoinduced Step&#8208;Growth Polymerization of N&#8208;Methylpyrrole and N&#8208;Methylindole</title>

         <dc:description>
Photoinduced step&#8208;growth polymerization of N&#8208;methylpyrrole and N&#8208;methylindole was accomplished using phenacyl bromide as single&#8208;component photoinitiator under near&#8208;UV irradiation.







Abstract
The synthesis of step&#8208;growth polymers by photoinduced methods is a challenging issue in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report a single component near UV responsive photopolymerization system for step&#8208;growth polymerization of N&#8208;methylpyrrole (MPyr) and N&#8208;methylindole (MIn) by using phenacyl bromide (PAB). The obtained high molecular weight conjugated polymers were characterized by spectral and chromatographic methods. Detailed laser flash photolysis and spectroscopic studies revealed that polymerization proceeds by successive photoinduced cleavage of PAB followed by electron transfer, proton release and coupling processes. After photolysis, chain growth continues also in daylight or dark by acidic oxidation. The structural features of the polymers were investigated. PAB single component photoinitiator enables an efficient, rapid, room temperature step&#8208;growth polymerization process of MPyr and MIn that can be applied to other conjugated monomers.

An ultrathin covalent organic framework (COF) was constructed homogeneously on the surface of a graphene template via a facile hydrothermal method, as reported by Freddy Kleitz and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202206564). Benefitting from the maximum exposure of active sites and sufficient interaction with target water pollutants, ultrathin COF could effectively shorten equilibrium time and increase adsorption capacity for the removal of organic dyes with various sizes.

         <title>Synergistic Catalysis between a Dipeptide Phosphonium Salt and a Metal&#8208;Based Lewis Acid for Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8208;Bridged [3.2.1] Ring Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergic catalytic method for asymmetric construction of N&#8208;bridged [3.2.1] rings by a phosphonium salt/silver co&#8208;catalyzed cyclization has been developed. This route affords fluorine&#8208;installed tropane derivatives in excellent stereoselectivities. The mechanistic results revealed that the silver nitrite was installed on the phosphonium salt via hydrogen bonding and simultaneously activated the dipole, in a &#8220;sandwich&#8221; reaction model.







Abstract
We present an unprecedented synergic catalytic route for the asymmetric construction of fluorinated N&#8208;bridged [3.2.1] cyclic members of tropane family via a bifunctional phosphonium salt/silver co&#8208;catalyzed cyclization process. A broad variety of substrates bearing an assortment of functional groups are compatible with this method, providing targeted compounds bearing seven&#8208;membered ring and four contiguous stereocenters in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities. The gram&#8208;scale preparations, facile elaborations and preliminary biological activities of the products demonstrate the application potential. Moreover, both experimental and computational mechanistic studies revealed that the cyclization proceeded via a &#8220;sandwich&#8221; reaction model with multiple weak&#8208;bond cooperative activations. Insights gained from our studies are expected to advance general efforts towards the catalytic synthesis of challenging chiral heterocyclic molecules.

         <title>A Stable and Conductive Covalent Organic Framework with Isolated Active Sites for Highly Selective Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Acetate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroreduction of CO2 to acetate provides a promising strategy to reduce CO2 emissions and store renewable energy, but acetate is usually a by&#8208;product. A covalent organic framework with isolated active sites for highly selective electroreduction of CO2 to acetate was revealed by Pei&#8208;Qin Liao and co&#8208;wokers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202206470). The copper&#8208;phthalocyanine active site with high electron density is conducive to the key step of C&#8722;C coupling of *CH3 with CO2 to produce acetate, and can avoid the coupling of *CO with *CO or *CHO to produce ethylene and ethanol.

         <title>Organometallic Synthesis of Magnetic Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic metal nanoparticles (MMNPs) have great potential in a multitude of applications such as catalysis, biomedicine and environmental remediation. This Minireview highlights advances over the last two decades in the organometallic synthesis of MMNPs. The resulting MMNPs have tailor&#8208;made sizes, shapes, compositions and magnetic properties, leading to their application in magnetically induced catalysis and biosensing.







Abstract
Magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) are attractive both for their fundamental properties and for their potential in a variety of applications ranging from nanomedicine and biology to micro/nanoelectronics and catalysis. While these fields are dominated by the use of iron oxides, reduced metal NPs are of interest since they display high magnetization and adjustable anisotropy according to their size, shape and composition. The use of organometallic precursors makes it possible to adjust the size, shape (sphere, cube, rod, wire, urchin, &#8230;) and composition (alloys, core&#8211;shell, composition gradient, dumbbell, &#8230;) of the resulting NPs and hence their magnetic properties. We discuss here the synthesis of magnetic metal NPs from organometallic precursors carried out in Toulouse, as well as their associated properties and their potential in applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots (QDs) synthesized by traditional methods are unstable, so that they are usually coated with cadmium sulfide (CdS) to prevent oxidation, which are complicated and not satisfactory for mass production. Here, stable ternary Pb1&#8208;xCdxS QDs were synthesized by in situ coprecipitatation of Pb4&#8208;nCdnO4 bimetallic clusters in an aqueous solution, which possess a uniform size of 4.0 &#177; 0.2 nm and the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission at 1100 nm with photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as 17.72%. Stored at 4 &#176;C and in colloidal form, the PLQY of Pb1&#8208;xCdxS QDs remained at 90.9% of the initial value after 15 days, while stored as powder, the spectra did not change after 5 months. The high PLQY and good water compatibility of Pb1&#8208;xCdxS QDs provide a good performance in vivo vasculature imaging and lymphatic system imaging at a very low power density (10 mW/cm2) in the NIR&#8208;II window.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Periodic Regeneration of Catalyst during CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing electrocatalytic reaction with high&#8208;efficiency meets the need for the sustainable society, which can make important contribution to carbon neutrality. However, poor long&#8208;term stability of catalysts is a bottleneck for its practical application. Herein, an &#8220;in situ periodic regeneration of catalyst (PR&#8208;C)&#8221; strategy is proposed to maintain high efficiency of CO2 electroreduction towards C2+ products with long&#8208;term stability over Cu catalyst by applying a positive potential pulse for a short time periodically in the halide&#8208;containing electrolyte. The high faradaic efficiency (81.2%) and current density (22.6 mA cm&#8722;2) could be maintained completely at least 36 h, while the activity and selectivity decreased continuously without using the PR&#8208;C method. Control experiments and operando characterization demonstrated that the surface structure and oxidation state of Cu could be recovered periodically by the PR&#8208;C method, which was beneficial for CO2 activation and C&#8208;C coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>An Isolable 2,5&#8208;Disila&#8208;3,4&#8208;Diphosphapyrrole and a Conjugated Si=P&#8208;Si=P&#8208;Si=N Chain Through Degradation of White Phosphorus with a N,N&#8208;Bis(Silylenyl)Aniline</title>

         <dc:description>White phosphorus (P  4  ) undergoes degradation to P  2  moieties if exposed to the new  N,N  &#8208;bis(silylenyl)aniline PhN  Si  2  1  (  Si  = Si[N(  t  Bu)]  2  CPh), furnishing the first isolable 2,5&#8208;disila&#8208;3,4&#8208;diphosphapyrrole  2  and the two novel functionalized Si=P doubly bonded compounds  3  and  4  . The pathways for the transformation of the non&#8208;aromatic 2,5&#8208;disila&#8208;3,4&#8208;diphosphapyrrole PhN  Si  2  P  2  2  into  3  and  4  could be uncovered. It became evident that  2  reacts readily with both reactants P  4  and  1  to afford either the polycyclic Si=P&#8208;containing product [PhN  Si  2  P  2  ]  2  P  2  3  or the unprecedented conjugated  Si  =P&#8208;  Si  =P&#8208;  Si  =NPh chain&#8208;containing compound  4  , depending on the employed molar ratio of  1  and P  4  as well as the reaction conditions. Compounds  3  and  4  can be converted into each other by reactions with  1  and P  4  , respectively. All new compounds  1  &#8208;  4  were unequivocally characterized including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. In addition, the electronic structures of  2  &#8208;  4  were established by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>
