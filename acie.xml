         <title>A Facile Strategy for Constructing High&#8208;Performance Polymer Electrolytes via Anion Modification and Click Chemistry for Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer electrolytes play a crucial role in advancing rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) owing to their exceptional characteristics, including high flexibility, superior interface compatibility, broad electrochemical stability window, and enhanced safety features. Despite these advantages, research in this domain remains nascent, plagued by single preparation approaches and challenges associated with the compatibility between polymer electrolytes and Mg metal anode. In this study, we present a novel synthesis strategy to fabricate a glycerol &#945;,&#945;'&#8208;diallyl ether&#8208;3,6&#8208;dioxa&#8208;1,8&#8208;octanedithiol&#8208;based polymer electrolyte supported by glass fiber substrate (GDT@GF) through anion modification and thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry polymerization. The developed route exhibits novelty and high efficiency, leading to the production of GDT@GF membranes featuring exceptional mechanical properties, heightened ionic conductivity, elevated Mg2+ transference number, and commendable compatibility with Mg anode. The assembled modified Mo6S8||GDT@GF||Mg cells exhibit outstanding performance across a wide temperature range and address critical safety concerns, showcasing the potential for applications under extreme conditions. Our innovative preparation strategy offers a promising avenue for the advancement of polymer electrolytes in high&#8208;performance rechargeable magnesium batteries, while also opens up possibilities for future large&#8208;scale applications and the development of flexible electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Modulation of Multiple Sites Boosts Anti&#8208;Poisoning Hydrogen Electrooxidation Reaction with Ultrasmall     (Pt0.9Rh0.1)3V    Ternary Intermetallic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Promoting the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity and poisoning tolerance of electrocatalysts is crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of hydrogen&#8208;oxygen fuel cell. However, it is severely hindered by the scaling relations among different intermediates. Herein, lattice&#8208;contracted Pt&#8208;Rh in ultrasmall ternary L12&#8208;(Pt0.9Rh0.1)3V intermetallic nanoparticles (~2.2 nm) were fabricated to promote the HOR performances through an oxides self&#8208;confined growth strategy. The prepared (Pt0.9Rh0.1)3V displayed 5.5/3.7 times promotion in HOR mass/specific activity than Pt/C in pure H2 and dramatically limited activity attenuation in 1000 ppm CO/H2 mixture. In&#8208;situ Raman spectra tracked the superior anti&#8208;CO* capability as a result of compressive strained Pt, and the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing species was promoted due to the dual&#8208;functional effect. Further assisted by density functional theory calculations, both the adsorption of H* and CO* on (Pt0.9Rh0.1)3V were reduced compared with that of Pt due to lattice contraction, while the adsorption of OH* was enhanced by introducing oxyphilic Rh sites. This work provides an effective tactic to stimulate the electrocatalytic performances by optimizing the adsorption of different intermediates severally.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Acid Enabled Comprehensive Training of Poly (Sodium Acrylate) Hydrogel NetworksStrong Acid Enabled Comprehensive Training of Poly (Sodium Acrylate) Hydrogel Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of admire hydrogel networks is of both practical and fundamental importance for diverse applications of hydrogels. Herein a general strategy of acid&#8208;assisted training is designed to enable multiple improvement of conventional poly (sodium acrylate) networks for hydrogels. Hydrophobic homogeneous crosslinked poly (sodium acrylate) hydrogels are prepared to verify the strategy. The acid&#8208;assisted training is simply achieved by immersing the hydrogel networks into 4 M H2SO4 solutions. The introduced acids would induce transformation of poly (sodium acrylate) into poly (acrylic acid) at hydrogel surface, which constructs dynamic hydrogen bonding interactions to tighten the network. The acid&#8208;containing poly (sodium acrylate) hydrogels newly generate anti&#8208;swelling and self&#8208;healing performance, and show mechanical improvement. The internal poly (sodium acrylate) of the pristine acid&#8208;containing hydrogels is further fully transformed via acid&#8208;infiltration after following cyclic stretch/release training to significantly improve the mechanical performance. The Young&#8217;s modulus, stress, and toughness of the fully&#8208;trained hydrogels are 187.6 times, 35.6 times, and 5.4 times enhanced, respectively. The polymeric networks retain isotropic in fully&#8208;trained hydrogels to ensure superior stretchability of 8.6. The acid&#8208;assisted training performance of the hydrogels can be reversibly recovered by NaOH neutralization. The acid&#8208;assisted training strategy here is general for poly (sodium acrylate) hydrogels.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Miscibility of Polymer Donor and Polymer Acceptor by Reducing Chain Entanglement for Realizing 18.64% Efficiency All Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;polymer solar cells have experienced rapid development in recent years by the emergence of polymerized small molecular acceptors (PSMAs). However, the strong chain entanglements of polymer donors (PDs) and polymer acceptors (PAs) decrease the miscibility of the resulting polymer mixtures, making it challenging to optimize the blend morphology. Herein, we designed three PAs, namely PBTPICm&#8208;BDD, PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD and PBTPICF&#8208;BDD, by smartly using a BDD unit as the polymerized unit to copolymerize with different Y&#8208;typed non&#8208;fullerene small molecular acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs), thus achieving a certain degree of distortion and giving the polymer system enough internal space to reduce the entanglements of the polymer chains. Such effects increase the chances of the PD being interspersed into the acceptor material, which improve the solubility between the PD and PA. The PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD and PBTPICF&#8208;BDD displayed better miscibility with PBQx&#8208;TCl, leading to a well optimized morphology. As a result, high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 17.50% and 17.17% were achieved for PBQx&#8208;TCl:PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD and PBQx&#8208;TCl:PBTPICF&#8208;BDD devices, respectively. With the addition of PYF&#8208;T&#8208;o as the third component into PBQx&#8208;TCl:PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD blend to further extend the absorption spectral coverage and finely tune microstructures of the blend morphology, a remarkable PCE of 18.64% was realized finally.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Molecular Engineering for Fully Textured Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing large&#8208;scale monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem devices based on industrial Czochralski silicon wafers will likely have to adopt double&#8208;side textured architecture, given their optical benefits and low manufacturing costs. However, the surface engineering strategies that are widely used in solution&#8208;processed perovskites to regulate the interface properties are not directly applicable to micrometric textures. Here, we devise a surface passivation strategy by dynamic spray coating (DSC) &#64258;uorinated thiophenethylammonium ligands, combining the advantages of providing conformal coverage and suppressing phase conversion on textured surfaces. From the viewpoint of molecular engineering, theoretical calculation and experimental results demonstrate that introducing trifluoromethyl group provide more effective surface passivation through strong interaction and energy alignment by forming a  dipole layer. Consequently, the DSC treatment of this bifunctional molecule enables the tandem cells based on industrial silicon wafers to achieve a certified stabilized power conversion efficiency of 30.89%. In addition, encapsulated devices display excellent operational stability by retaining over 97% of their initial performance after 600&#8201;h continuous illumination.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Single Atom/Nanoparticle Ensemble for Efficient Photochemical Cascade Synthesis of Ethylene from Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven photoredox catalysis presents a promising approach for the activation and conversion of methane (CH4) into  high value&#8208;added chemicals under ambient conditions. However, the high C&#8722;H bond dissociation energy of CH4 and the absence of well&#8208;defined C&#8722;H activation sites on catalysts significantly limit the highly efficient conversion of CH4 toward multicarbon (C2+) hydrocarbons, particularly ethylene (C2H4). Herein, we demonstrate a bimetallic design of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and Pd single atoms (SAs) on ZnO for the cascade conversion of CH4 into C2H4 with the highest production rate compared with previous works. Mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic effect of Ag NPs and Pd SAs, upon effecting key bond&#8208;breaking and &#8208;forming events, lowers the overall energy barrier of the activation process of both CH4 and the resulting C2H6, constituting a truly synergistic catalytic system to facilitate the C2H4 generation. This work offers a novel perspective on the advancement of photocatalytic directional CH4 conversion toward high value&#8208;added C2+ hydrocarbons through the subtle design of bimetallic cascade catalyst strategy.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Light-driven photoredox catalysis presents a promising approach for the activation and conversion of methane (CH4) into  high value-added chemicals under ambient conditions. However, the high C&#8722;H bond dissociation energy of CH4 and the absence of well-defined C&#8722;H activation sites on catalysts significantly limit the highly efficient conversion of CH4 toward multicarbon (C2+) hydrocarbons, particularly ethylene (C2H4). Herein, we demonstrate a bimetallic design of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and Pd single atoms (SAs) on ZnO for the cascade conversion of CH4 into C2H4 with the highest production rate compared with previous works. Mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic effect of Ag NPs and Pd SAs, upon effecting key bond-breaking and -forming events, lowers the overall energy barrier of the activation process of both CH4 and the resulting C2H6, constituting a truly synergistic catalytic system to facilitate the C2H4 generation. This work offers a novel perspective on the advancement of photocatalytic directional CH4 conversion toward high value-added C2+ hydrocarbons through the subtle design of bimetallic cascade catalyst strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanical&#8208;Force&#8208;Induced Non&#8208;spontaneous Dehalogenative Deuteration of Aromatic Iodides Enabled by Using Piezoelectric Materials as a Redox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a catalytic, non&#8208;spontaneous dehalogenation process for the deuteration of aryl iodides using BaTiO3 as a catalyst. This method achieves high levels of deuterium incorporation using only 2.0&#8197;equivalents of D2O, which additionally acts as an electron donor. Furthermore, deuteration enhances the biological activity of D&#8208;ipriflavone, markedly inhibiting osteoclast differentiation.







Abstract
The development of green and efficient deuteration methods is of great significance for various fields such as organic synthesis, analytical chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we have developed a dehalogenative deuteration strategy using piezoelectric materials as catalysts in a solid&#8208;phase system under ball&#8208;milling conditions. This non&#8208;spontaneous reaction is induced by mechanical force. D2O can serve as both a deuterium source and an electron donor in the transformation, eliminating the need for additional stoichiometric exogenous reductants. A series of (hetero)aryl iodides can be transformed into deuterated products with high deuterium incorporation. This method not only effectively overcomes existing synthetic challenges but can also be used for deuterium labelling of drug molecules and derivatives. Bioactivity experiments with deuterated drug molecule suggest that the D&#8208;ipriflavone enhances the inhibitory effects on osteoclast differentiation of BMDMs in vitro.

         <title>Merging High&#8208;Pressure Syngas Metal Catalysis and Biocatalysis in Tandem One&#8208;Pot Processes for the Synthesis of Nonchiral and Chiral Alcohols from Alkenes in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem one&#8208;pot process combining high&#8208;pressure hydroformylation of 1&#8208;octene and enzymatic reduction is demonstrated, leading to &gt;99&#8201;% conversion and 80&#8201;% yield of the isolated alcohol isomers. This concept was extended to the hydroformylation of styrene and enzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution, resulting in excellent conversion (&gt;99&#8201;%) and an enantiomeric ratio of 91&#8201;:&#8201;9 for (S)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanol.







Abstract
While simultaneously proceeding reactions are among the most fascinating features of biosynthesis, this concept of tandem processes also offers high potential in the chemical industry in terms of less waste production and improved process efficiency and sustainability. Although examples of one&#8208;pot chemoenzymatic syntheses exist, the combination of completely different reaction types is rare. Herein, we demonstrate that extreme &#8220;antipodes&#8221; of the &#8220;worlds of catalysis&#8221;, such as syngas&#8208;based high&#8208;pressure hydroformylation and biocatalyzed reduction, can be combined within a tandem&#8208;type one&#8208;pot process in water. No significant deactivation was found for either the biocatalyst or the chemocatalyst. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the one&#8208;pot process starting from 1&#8208;octene was established with &gt;99&#8201;% conversion and 80&#8201;% isolated yield of the desired alcohol isomers. All necessary components for hydroformylation and biocatalysis were added to the reactor from the beginning. This concept has been extended to the enantioselective synthesis of chiral products by conducting the hydroformylation of styrene and an enzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution in a tandem mode, leading to an excellent conversion of &gt;99&#8201;% and an enantiomeric ratio of 91&#8201;:&#8201;9 for (S)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanol. The overall process runs in water under mild and energy&#8208;saving conditions, without any need for intermediate isolation.

         <title>Recent Progress in Using Covalent Organic Frameworks to Stabilize Metal Anodes for Highly&#8208;Efficient Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a comprehensive discussion of the advantages and challenges of alkali metals and multivalent metals as anodes, this minireview summarizes the latest progress on the application of COFs in electrode engineering, electrolyte optimization, and separator modification. Emphasis is placed on new insights into the synthesis, design, and characterization analysis of COFs to effectively improve metal anode performance.







Abstract
Alkali metals (e.g. Li, Na, and K) and multivalent metals (e.g. Zn, Mg, Ca, and Al) have become star anodes for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries due to their high theoretical capacity and excellent conductivity. However, the inevitable dendrites and unstable interfaces of metal anodes pose challenges to the safety and stability of batteries. To address these issues, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as emerging materials, have been widely investigated due to their regular porous structure, flexible molecular design, and high specific surface area. In this minireview, we summarize the research progress of COFs in stabilizing metal anodes. First, we present the research origins of metal anodes and delve into their advantages and challenges as anodes based on the physical/chemical properties of alkali and multivalent metals. Then, special attention has been paid to the application of COFs in the host design of metal anodes, artificial solid electrolyte interfaces, electrolyte additives, solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and separator modifications. Finally, a new perspective is provided for the research of metal anodes from the molecular design, pore modulation, and synthesis of COFs.

         <title>Fluorinated Surface Engineering Towards High&#8208;Rate and Durable Potassium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuned fluorinated surface was proposed to achieve an ultra&#8208;thin and KF&#8208;enriched solid electrolyte interphase in potassium&#8208;ion battery. The tailored C&#8722;F configurations could induce local surface polarization to guide electrolyte decomposing orderly and prompt the enrichment of KF crystals in SEI by self&#8208;sacrifice dissociation.

Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) crucially affects the rate performance and cycling lifespan, yet to date more extensive research is still needed in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. We report an ultra&#8208;thin and KF&#8208;enriched SEI triggered by tuned fluorinated surface design in electrode. Our results reveal that fluorination engineering alters the interfacial chemical environment to facilitate inherited electronic conductivity, enhance adsorption ability of potassium, induce localized surface polarization to guide electrolyte decomposition behavior for SEI formation, and especially, enrich the KF crystals in SEI by self&#8208;sacrifice from C&#8722;F bond cleavage. Hence, the regulated fluorinated electrode with generated ultra&#8208;thin, uniform, and KF&#8208;enriched SEI shows improved capacity of 439.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (3.82&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), boosted rate performance (202.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 8.70&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and durable cycling performance (even under high loading of ~8.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). We expect this practical engineering principle to open up new opportunities for upgrading the development of potassium&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Tuned fluorinated surface was proposed to achieve an ultra-thin and KF-enriched solid electrolyte interphase in potassium-ion battery. The tailored C&#8722;F configurations could induce local surface polarization to guide electrolyte decomposing orderly and prompt the enrichment of KF crystals in SEI by self-sacrifice dissociation. The electrode shows boosted rate performance and durable cycling performance under high loading of ~8.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Constructing Metal(II)&#8208;Sulfate Site Catalysts toward Low Overpotential Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction to Fuel Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CuO/Cu&#8722;NSO4/CN composite containing highly dispersed Cu(II)&#8722;SO4 sites, where CO2 electroreduction to formate occurs at a low overpotential with high selectivity (&#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE, FEformate=87.4&#8201;%) via a carboxyl intermediate, was prepared. With the enlightenment of this new pathway, more metals might show their potential to convert CO2 under appropriate modulation.







Abstract
Precise regulation of the active site structure is an important means to enhance the activity and selectivity of catalysts in CO2 electroreduction. Here, we creatively introduce anionic groups, which can not only stabilize metal sites with strong coordination ability but also have rich interactions with protons at active sites to modify the electronic structure and proton transfer process of catalysts. This strategy helps to convert CO2 into fuel chemicals at low overpotentials. As a typical example, a composite catalyst, CuO/Cu&#8722;NSO4/CN, with highly dispersed Cu(II)&#8722;SO4 sites has been reported, in which CO2 electroreduction to formate occurs at a low overpotential with a high Faradaic efficiency (&#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE, FEformate=87.4&#8201;%). Pure HCOOH is produced with an energy conversion efficiency of 44.3&#8201;% at a cell voltage of 2.8&#8197;V. Theoretical modeling demonstrates that sulfate promotes CO2 transformation into a carboxyl intermediate followed by HCOOH generation, whose mechanism is significantly different from that of the traditional process via a formate intermediate for HCOOH production.

Abstract
Intermolecular pnictogen bonding (PnB) catalysis has received increased interest in non&#8208;covalent organocatalysis. It has been demonstrated that organic electron&#8208;deficient pnictogen atoms can act as prospective Lewis acids. Here, we present a catalytic approach for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral PIII compounds by combining intramolecular PnB interactions and carbene catalysis. Our design features a pre&#8208;chiral phosphorus molecule bearing two electron&#8208;withdrawing benzoyl groups, resulting in the formation of a &#963;&#8208;hole at the P atom. X&#8208;ray and non&#8208;covalent interaction (NCI) analysis indicate that the model substrates exhibit intrinsic PnB interaction between the oxygen atom of the formyl group and the phosphorus atom. This induces a conformational locking effect, leading to the crystallization of the phosphorus substrate in a preferred conformation (P212121 chiral group). Under the catalysis of N&#8211;heterocyclic carbene, the aldehyde moiety activated by the pnictogen bond selectively reacts with an alcohol to yield the corresponding chiral monoester/phosphorus product with excellent enantioselectivity. This Lewis acidic phosphorus center, aroused by the non&#8208;polarized intramolecular pnictogen bond interaction, assists in conformational and selective regulations, providing unique opportunities for catalysis and beyond.

         <title>Formation of a Porous Crystalline Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy Overlayer on Metal Catalysts via Controlled Solid&#8208;State Reactions for High&#8208;temperature Stable Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reactions with limited Mg migration transform the amorphous Al2O3 overlayer on MgAl2O4&#8208;supported metal catalysts into a porous Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy crystalline spinel structure with a pore size of 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm and weakened acidity, which allows achieving remarkably high stability while preserving high activity over Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy&#8208;coated Ni/MgAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts in methane dry reforming and propane dehydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Catalyst deactivation by sintering and coking is a long&#8208;standing issue in metal&#8208;catalyzed harsh high&#8208;temperature hydrocarbon reactions. Ultrathin oxide coatings of metal nanocatalysts have recently appeared attractive to address this issue, while the porosity of the overlayer is difficult to control to preserve the accessibility of embedded metal nanoparticles, thus often leading to a large decrease in activity. Here, we report that a nanometer&#8208;thick alumina coating of MgAl2O4&#8208;supported metal catalysts followed by high&#8208;temperature reduction can transform a nonporous amorphous alumina overlayer into a porous Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy crystalline spinel structure with a pore size of 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm and weakened acidity. The high porosity stems from the restrained Mg migration from the MgAl2O4 support to the alumina overlayer through solid&#8208;state reactions at high temperatures. The resulting Ni/MgAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts with a porous crystalline Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy overlayer achieved remarkably high stability while preserving much higher activity than the corresponding alumina&#8208;coated Ni and Pt catalysts on MgO and Al2O3 supports in the reactions of dry reforming of methane and propane dehydrogenation, respectively.

         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;chained dipolymer with steric hindrance and coordination reconstructs the Zn2+ solvation structure in liquid electrolyte by a balanced push&#8208;pull dynamic on Zn2+ and H2O, forms a dipolymer&#8208;inorganic hybrid SEI in situ, and regulates the electrochemical reduction kinetics, considerably prolonging the cycle life of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries are prospective energy storge devices due to their intrinsically high safety and cost effectiveness. Yet, uneven deposition of zinc ions in electrochemical reduction and side reactions at the anode interface significantly hinder their development and application. Here, we propose a solvation&#8208;interface attenuation strategy enabled by a frustrated tertiary amine amphiphilic dipolymer electrolyte additive. The configuration of superhydrophilic segments with covalently bonded lipophilic spacers enables coupled steric hindrance/coordination, which establishes a balanced push&#8208;pull dynamic of dipolymer&#8208;H2O&#8208;Zn2+. Such interplay reconstructs the solvation structure of Zn2+ and allows the formation of a stable dipolymer&#8208;inorganic hybrid solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. This SEI layer effectively shields the zinc&#8208;metal anode from water and anions, significantly reducing side reactions. In addition, the dipolymer adsorbed at the zinc&#8208;metal anode interface regulates the interfacial electrochemical reduction kinetics and ensures uniform zinc deposition. As a result, the Zn&#8722;Zn symmetric cells with dipolymer&#8208;containing electrolyte exhibit remarkable cycling stability exceeding 5800&#8197;h (242&#8197;days). The Zn&#8208;NVO batteries and Zn&#8208;AC hybrid ion supercapacitors also deliver stable cycling for up to 1440&#8197;h (60&#8197;days) with high&#8208;capacity retention over 80&#8201;%. This research demonstrates the potential to facilitate the development and commercialization of zinc&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Innovative Approach to Chiral Polyurethanes: Asymmetric Copolymerization with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we demonstrated the first example for the asymmetric copolymerization of various meso&#8208;epoxide with isocyanates toward the synthesis of chiral polymers with unique nitrogen functionality. Intramolecular bimetallic coordination strategies provided completely alternating copolymers with high carbamate unit content (up to 94&#8201;%) and high enantioselectivity (up to 94&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The introduction of nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups to chiral polymer backbones enables the tailoring of physical properties and offers opportunities for further post&#8208;polymerization modification. However, the substrate scope of such polymers is extremely limited because monomers having nitrogen&#8208;containing groups can change coordination state with respect to the metal centers, thus decreasing the activity and enantioselectivity and even poisoning the catalyst completely. In this paper, we report our attempts to carry out the asymmetric copolymerization of meso&#8208;epoxide with highly reactive isocyanates. In particular, we found that biphenol&#8208;linked bimetallic Co(III) complexes with multiple chiral centers are very efficient in catalyzing this asymmetric copolymerization reaction, affording optically active polyurethanes with a completely alternating nature and a high enantioselectivity of up to 94&#8201;% ee. Crucially, we identified that the steric hindrance at the phenolate ortho position of the ligand strongly influences the catalytic activity and product enantioselectivity. In addition, density functional theory calculations revealed that the highly sterically bulky substituents change the mechanism from bimetallic to monometallic, and result in the unexpected inversion of the chiral induction direction. Moreover, the high stereoregularity of the produced polyurethanes enhances their thermal stability, and they can be selectively decomposed into oxazolidinones. This study offers a versatile methodology for the synthesis of chiral polymers containing nitrogen functionalities.

         <title>Patterned Photonic Actuators with Dynamic Shape&#8208;Morphing and Color&#8208;Changing Capabilities Fabricated by Athermal Embossing Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An athermal embossing technique is introduced for the rapid fabrication of patterned photonic actuators based on near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers. Two demonstration models, one butterfly&#8208;inspired actuator and the other origami crane&#8208;shaped actuator, have been created to validate the synergistic shape&#8208;morphing and color&#8208;changing capabilities of patterned photonic actuators.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive patterned photonic actuators, characterized by their patterned nano/microscale structures and capacity to demonstrate synergistic color changes and shape morphing in response to external stimuli, have attracted intense scientific attention. However, traditional patterned photonic actuator systems still face limitations such as cumbersome and time&#8208;consuming preparation processes and small&#8208;scale deformations. Herein, we introduce a facile approach involving an athermal embossing technique to rapidly fabricate patterned photonic actuators based on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers. The resulting patterned photonic actuators demonstrate remarkable features, including brilliant angle&#8208;dependent structural color, complex three&#8208;dimensional actuation, and good color durability under NIR light stimulation. As illustrative demonstrations of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we fabricate two light&#8208;fuelled patterned photonic soft actuators: a butterfly&#8208;inspired actuator that can produce wing&#8208;flapping dynamic changes in structural color, and an origami crane&#8208;shaped actuator with shape memory, structural color information storage, and dynamic display properties. This strategy provides distinct insights into the design and fabrication of various patterned photonic soft robotic devices and intelligent actuators.

         <title>Autophagy&#8208;Inducing MoO3&#8208;x Nanowires Boost Photothermal&#8208;Triggered Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoO3&#8208;x nanowires with high oxygen vacancy acts as a photothermal agent in combination with photothermal therapy to ablate tumors through hyperthermia, thus induces pro&#8208;death function of autophagy, and increases the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens to act as an effective specific immunostimulant, finally promotes immunogenic cell death in tumor therapy.







Abstract
Autophagy could play suppressing role in cancer therapy by facilitating release of tumor antigens from dying cells and inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD). Therefore, discovery and rational design of more effective inducers of cytotoxic autophagy is expected to develop new strategies for finding innovative drugs for precise and successful cancer treatment. Herein, we develop MoO3&#8208;x nanowires (MoO3&#8208;x NWs) with high oxygen vacancy and strong photothermal responsivity to ablate tumors through hyperthermia, thus promote the induction of cytotoxic autophagy and severe ICD. As expected, the combination of MoO3&#8208;x NWs and photothermal therapy (PTT) effectively induces autophagy to promote the release of tumor antigens from the ablated cells, and induces the maturation and antigen presentation of dendritic cells (DCs), subsequently activates cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)&#8208;mediated adaptive immunity. Furthermore, the combination treatment of MoO3&#8208;x NWs with immune checkpoint blockade of PD&#8208;1 could promote the tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization into tumor&#8208;killing M1 macrophages, inhibit infiltration of Treg cells at tumor sites, and alleviate immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, finally intensify the anti&#8208;tumor activity in vivo. This study provides a strategy and preliminary elucidation of the mechanism of using MoO3&#8208;x nanowires with high oxygen vacancy to induce autophagy and thus enhance photothermal immunotherapy.

         <title>Efficient Silver(I)&#8208;Containing i&#8208;Motif DNA Hybrid Catalyst for Enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inherent chiral structures of DNA serve as attractive scaffolds to construct DNA hybrid catalysts for valuable enantioselective transformations. Duplex and G&#8208;quadruplex DNA&#8208;based enantioselective catalysis has made great progress, yet novel design strategies of DNA hybrid catalysts are highly demanding and atomistic analysis of active centers is still challenging. DNA i&#8208;motif structures could be finely tuned by different cytosine&#8208;cytosine base pairs, providing a new platform to design DNA catalysts. Herein, we found that a human telomeric i&#8208;motif DNA containing cytosine&#8208;silver(I)&#8208;cytosine (C&#8208;Ag+&#8208;C) base pairs interacting with Cu(II) ions (i&#8208;motif DNA(Ag+)/Cu2+) could catalyze Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with full conversions and up to 95% enantiomeric excess. As characterized by various physicochemical techniques, the presence of Ag+ is proved to replace the protons in hemiprotonated cytosine&#8208;cytosine (C:C+) base pairs and stabilize the DNA i&#8208;motif to allow the acceptance of Cu(II) ions. The i&#8208;motif DNA(Ag+)/Cu2+ catalyst shows about 8&#8208;fold rate acceleration compared with DNA and Cu2+. Based on DNA mutation experiments, thermodynamic studies and density function theory calculations, the catalytic center of Cu(II) ion is proposed to be located in a specific loop region via binding to one nitrogen&#8208;7 atom of an unpaired adenine and two phosphate&#8208;oxygen atoms from nearby deoxythymidine monophosphate and deoxyadenosine monophosphate, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Metastable Supramolecular Assembly of Simple Monomers Enabled by Confinement: Towards Aqueous Phase Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of supramolecular assembly (SA) with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in aqueous phase has the potential to revolutionize numerous fields. However, using simple molecules with crystalline RTP to construct SA with aqueous phase RTP is hardly possible from the standpoint of forces. The reason lies in that the transition from crystal to SA involves a structure transformation from highly stable to more dynamic state, leading to increased non&#8208;radiative deactivation pathways and silent RTP signal. Here, with the benefit of the confinement from the layered double hydroxide (LDH), various simple molecules (benzene derivatives) can successfully form metastable SA with aqueous phase RTP. The maximum of RTP lifetime and efficiency can reach 654.87 ms and 5.02%, respectively. Mechanistic studies reveal the LDH energy trap can strengthen the intermolecular interaction, providing the prerequisite for the existence of metastable SA and appearance of aqueous phase RTP. The universality of this strategy will usher exploration into other multifunctional monomer, facilitating the development of SAs with aqueous phase RTP.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridazine&#8208;Promoted Construction of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Exceptional Capability of Stepwise Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we successfully developed two novel vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) using 2&#8208;connected 3,6&#8208;dimethylpyridazine through Knoevenagel condensation. These COFs featured finely tailored micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;scale pore sizes, high surface areas and stable non&#8208;polar vinylene linkages. Finely resolved powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns demonstrated highly crystalline structures with a hexagonal lattice in the AA layer stacking. The resulting one&#8208;dimensional channels possess strong hydrogen&#8208;bond accepting sites arising from the decorated cis&#8208;azo/azine units with two pairs of fully exposed lone pair electrons, endowing the as&#8208;prepared COFs with exceptional water absorption properties. The g&#8208;DZPH&#8208;COF exhibited successive steep water uptake steps starting from low relative pressures (P/PSTA = 0.1), with the remarkable water uptake capacity of 0.26 g/g at P/PSTA = 0.2 (25&#176;C), which is the optimal value recorded among the reported COFs. Dynamic vapour sorption measurements revealed the fast kinetics of these COFs, even in the cluster formation process. Water uptake and release cycling tests demonstrated their outstanding hydrolytic stability, durability, and adsorption&#8211;desorption retention ability.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedited Synthesis of Metal Phosphides Maximizes Dispersion, Air Stability, and Catalytic Performance in Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal phosphides have been hailed as potential replacements for scarce noble metal catalysts in many aspects of the hydrogen economy from hydrogen evolution to selective hydrogenation reactions. But the need for dangerous and costly phosphorus precursors, limited support dispersion, and low stability of the metal phosphide surface toward oxidation substantially lower the appeal and performance of metal phosphides in catalysis. We show here that a 1&#8208;step procedure that relies on safe and cheap precursors can furnish an air&#8208;stable Ni2P/Al2O3 catalyst containing 3.2 nm nanoparticles. Ni2P/Al2O3 1&#8208;step is kinetically competitive with the palladium&#8208;based Lindlar catalyst in selective hydrogenation catalysis, and a loading corresponding to 4 ppm Ni was sufficient to convert 0.1 mol alkyne. The 1&#8208;step synthetic procedure alters the surface ligand speciation of Ni2P/Al2O3, which protects the nanoparticle surface from oxidation, and ensures that 85% of the initial catalytic activity was retained after the catalyst was stored under air for 1.5 years. Preparation of Ni2P on a variety of supports (silica, TiO2, SBA&#8208;15, ZrO2, C and HAP) as well as Co2P/Al2O3, Co2P/TiO2 and bimetallic NiCoP/TiO2 demonstrates the generality with which supported metal phosphides can be accessed in a safe and straightforward fashion with small sizes and high dispersion.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Monitoring of Supramolecular Interactions in Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many stimuli&#8208;responsive materials harness the reversible association of supramolecular binding motifs to enable advanced&#160;functionalities&#160;such as self&#8208;healing, switchable adhesion, or mechan&#173;ical adaptation.&#160;Despite extensive research into the structure&#8208;property relationships of these materials, direct correlations between&#160;molecular&#8208;level changes in supramolecular binding and macroscopic material behaviors have mostly remained elusive. Here, we show that this challenge can be overcome with supramolecular binding motifs featuring integrated binding indicators. We demonstrate this using a novel motif that combines a hydrogen&#8208;bonding ureido&#8208;4&#8208;pyrimidinone (UPy) with two strategically placed pyrene fluorophores.&#160;Dimerization of this motif promotes pyrene excimer formation, facilitating the straightforward optical&#160;quantification of&#160;supramolecular assembly under various conditions. We exploit the new motif&#160;as a supra&#173;molecular cross&#8208;linker in poly(methyl acrylate)s to probe the extent of (dis)assembly as a function of cross&#8208;linker content, processing history, and applied stimuli. We demonstrate that the stimuli&#8208;induced dissociation of supra&#173;molecular linkages strongly depends on the initial cross&#8208;link density, which also dictates whether&#160;the force&#8208;induced dissociation&#160;in polymer films correlates with the applied stress or strain. Thus, beyond introducing a robust tool for the&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;study of dynamic (dis)assembly mechanisms in supramolecular systems, our findings provide new insights into the mechanoresponsive behavior of such materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Using MXene as a&#160;Chemically Induced Initiator to Construct High&#8208;Performance Cathodes for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MXene usually exhibits weak pseudo&#8208;capacitance behavior in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, which cannot provide sufficient reversible capacity, resulting in the decline of overall capacity when used as the cathode materials. Taking inspiration from polymer electrolyte engineering, we have conceptualized an in&#8208;situ induced growth strategy based on MXene materials. Herein, 5.25 % MXene was introduced into the nucleation and growth process of vanadium oxide (HVO), providing the heterogeneous nucleation site and serving as an initiator to regulate the morphology and structural of vanadium oxide (T&#8208;HVO). The resulted materials can significantly improve the capacity and rate performance of zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The growth mechanism of T&#8208;HVO was demonstrated by both characterizations and DFT simulations, and the improved performance was systematically investigated through a series of in&#8208;situ experiments related to dynamic analysis steps. Finally, the evaluation and comparison of various defect introduction strategies revealed the efficient, safety, and high production output characteristics of the in&#8208;situ induced growth strategy. This work proposes the concept of in&#8208;situ induced growth strategy and discloses the induced chemical mechanism of MXene materials, which will aid the understanding, development, and application of cathode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Stabilization by Prelithiated Trithiocyanuric Acid as an Organic Additive in Sulfide&#8208;based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (ASSB) with a lithium metal anode (LMA) is a promising candidate to surpass conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries owing to their inherent safety against fire hazards and potential to achieve a higher energy density. However, the narrow electrochemical stability window and chemical reactivity of the sulfide solid electrolyte towards the LMA results in interfacial degradation and poor electrochemical performance. In this direction, we introduce an organic additive approach, that is the mixing of prelithiated trithiocyanuric acid, Li3TCA, with Li6PS5Cl, to establish a stable interface while preserving high ionic conductivity. Including 2.5 wt% Li3TCA alleviates the decomposition of the electrolyte on the lithium metal interface, decreasing the Li2S content in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) thus forming a more stable interface. In Li|Li symmetric cells this enables a rise in the critical current density from 1.0 to 1.9 mA cm&#8208;2 and stable cycling for over 750 hours at a high current density of 1.0 mA cm&#8722;2. This approach also enables Li|NbO&#8208;NCM811 full cell to operate more than 500 cycles at 0.3C.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Allylboration of Acetylene: A Versatile Tool for the Stereodivergent Synthesis of Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient catalytic methods that allow the use of simple and abundant chemical feedstocks for the preparation of synthetically versatile compounds are central to modern synthetic chemistry. Acetylene is a basic feedstock with a remarkable production over one million tons per year, although it is underutilized in the stereoselective synthesis of fine chemicals. Here we report a facile catalytic multicomponent reaction that allows for the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective allylboration of acetylene gas. This process is catalyzed by a chiral copper catalyst, operates without specialized equipment or pressurization, and provides chiral skipped dienes bearing stereodefined and orthogonally functionalized olefins with excellent levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The combined stereochemical features and orthogonal functionalization make the products privileged structural scaffolds to access the complete set of stereoisomers of the chiral skipped diene core through simple enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent pathways. The utility of the method is demonstrated with the enantioselective synthesis of three bioactive natural skipped diene products, namely (+)&#8208;Nyasol, (+)&#8208;Hinokiresinol and Phorbasin C, and other related synthetically relevant chiral molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium batteries emerge as promising alternatives to lithium batteries, leveraging their high natural abundance and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Developing potassium solid electrolytes (SEs) with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity is critical for realizing efficient potassium batteries. In this study, we present the synthesis of K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47, showcasing a room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 0.32 mS/cm and a low activation energy of 0.26 eV. This represents an increase of over two orders of magnitude compared to the parent compound K3SbS4, marking the highest reported ionic conductivity for non&#8208;oxide potassium SEs. Solid&#8208;state 39K magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning nuclear magnetic resonance on K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47 reveals an increased population of mobile K+ ions with fast dynamics. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations further confirm a delocalized K+ density and significantly enhanced K+ diffusion. This work demonstrates diversification of the anion sublattice as an effective approach to enhance ion transport and highlights K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47 as a promising SE for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Dichloromethane as C1 Synthon for the Photoredox Catalytic Cyclopropanation of Aromatic Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dichloromethane, as a readily available and inexpensive C1 synthon is proposed as a powerful building block for cyclopropanation of alkenes under mild conditions. Herein, we report a highly efficient and versatile dual photoredox system, involving a nickel aminopyridine coordination complex and a photocatalyst, for the cyclopropanation of aromatic olefins using dichloromethane, under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The cyclopropanation protocol has been successfully applied at gram scale. Mechanistic studies suggest a Ni(II) pyridyl radical complex as the key intermediate for the homolytic cleavage of the Csp3&#8722;Cl bond, generating a chloromethyl radical that is captured by the olefin coupling partner. Our findings also highlight the versatility of this methodology. By directing the radical/polar crossover process, we were able to selectively drive the reaction towards either the formation of cyclopropyl derivatives or the corresponding non&#8208;cyclic alkyl chloride products. The methodology also successfully apply to geminal dichloroalkanes, including the formation of spiro[2,2] compounds. Moreover, our methodology extends to the synthesis of deuterium&#8208;labelled cyclopropanes, demonstrating its utility in isotopic labelling and broadening its applicability in chemical synthesis and drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Remarkable Second Harmonic Generation Response in (C5H6NO)+(CH3SO3)&#8722;: Unraveling the Role of Hydrogen Bond in Thermal Driven Nonlinear Optical Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heat&#8208;activated second harmonic generation (SHG) switching materials are gaining interest for their ability to switch between SHG on and off states, offering potential in optoelectronic applications. The novel nonlinear optical (NLO) switch, (C5H6NO)+(CH3SO3)&#8722; (4&#8208;hydroxypyridinium methylsulfonate, 4HPMS), is a near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature thermal driven material with a strong SHG response (3.3 &#215; KDP), making it one of the most potent heat&#8208;stimulated NLO switches.

At 73 &#176;C, 4HPMS transitions from the noncentrosymmetric Pna21 room temperature phase (RTP) to the centrosymmetric P21/c phase, caused by the rotation of the (C5H6NO)+ and (CH3SO3)&#8722; due to partially thermal breaking of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The reverse phase change exhibits a large 50 &#176;C thermal hysteresis.

         <title>Active Oxygenated Structure&#8208;Intensified CO2 Capture Enables Efficient Electrochemical Ethylene Production Over Carbon Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We adopted an in situ oxidative carbonylation strategy to construct abundant quinone structures on carbon nanofibers. The intensified CO2 capture enables CO2&#8208;to&#8208;*CO conversion for enabling adequate *CO coverage and hindering *H adsorption in nearby Cu sites, leading to high&#8208;rate ethylene production. This study directs a new avenue for tailoring functional carbon materials and highlights a beneficial approach for designing carbon&#8208;capture structures for modulating the desired products during the CO2RR.







Abstract
The pursuit of high efficacy C&#8722;C coupling during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction remains a tremendous challenge owing to the high energy barrier of CO2 activation and insufficient coverage of the desired intermediates on catalytic sites. Inspired by the concept of capture&#8208;coupled CO2 activation, we fabricated quinone&#8208;grafted carbon nanofibers via an in situ oxidative carbonylation strategy. The quinone functionality of carbon nanofibers promotes the capture of CO2 followed by activation. At a current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the Faradaic efficiency of ethylene reached 62.9&#8201;%, and a partial current density of 295&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved on the quinone&#8208;rich carbon nanofibers. The results of in situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations indicated that the remarkable selectivity enhancement in ethylene originates from the quinone structure, rather than the electronic properties of Cu particles. The interaction of quinone with CO2 increases the local *CO coverage and simultaneously hinders the co&#8208;adsorption of *H on Cu sites, which greatly reduces the energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling and restrains subsequent *CO protonation. The modulation strategy involving specific oxygenated structure, as an independent degree of freedom, guides the design of functionalized carbon materials for tailoring the selectivity of desired products during the CO2 capture and reduction.

         <title>Carbon Free Radical (R&#8901;) Inactivates NF&#8208;&#954;B for Radical Capping Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical capping strategy is proposed by assembling carbon radical (R&#8901;) precursors loaded nanomicelles. R&#8901; is found to mediate electrophilic radical addition towards double bonds in DNA, and simultaneously cap the sulfhydryl residues in NF&#8208;&#954;B through radical chain reaction, resulting in a remarkable NF&#8208;&#954;B inactivation and tumor metastasis inhibition. This mechanism is promising in macromolecules modification and radical mediated cancer therapy.







Abstract
Inactivating hyperactivated transcription factors can overcome tumor therapy resistance, but their undruggable features limit the development of conventional inhibitors. Here, we report that carbon&#8208;centered free radicals (R&#8901;) can inactivate NF&#8208;&#954;B transcription by capping the active sites in both NF&#8208;&#954;B and DNA. We construct a type of thermosensitive R&#8901; initiator loaded amphiphilic nano&#8208;micelles to facilitate intracellular delivery of R&#8901;. At a temperature of 43&#8201;&#176;C, the generated R&#8901; engage in electrophilic radical addition towards double bonds in nucleotide bases, and simultaneously cap the sulfhydryl residues in NF&#8208;&#954;B through radical chain reaction. As a result, both NF&#8208;&#954;B nuclear translocation and NF&#8208;&#954;B&#8208;DNA binding are suppressed, leading to a remarkable NF&#8208;&#954;B inhibition of up to 94.1&#8201;%. We have further applied R&#8901; micelles in a clinical radiofrequency ablation tumor therapy model, showing remarkable NF&#8208;&#954;B inactivation and consequently tumor metastasis inhibition. Radical capping strategy not only provides a method to solve the heat&#8208;sink effect in clinic tumor hyperthermia, but also suggests a new perspective for controllable modification of biomacromolecules in cancer therapy.

         <title>Purely Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Molecule for High&#8208;Performance Non&#8208;Doped Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;doped OLEDs with conventional complex configurations containing thin emitting layers and simplified configurations featuring thick emitting layers as well as non&#8208;doped tandem and top&#8208;emitting OLEDs are achieved based on a tailor&#8208;made purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) molecule, providing the best electrophosphorescence efficiencies with ultrasmall efficiency roll&#8208;offs ever reported for RTP molecules.







Abstract
Purely organic molecules with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are potential luminescent materials with high exciton utilization for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), but those exhibiting superb electroluminescence (EL) performances are rarely explored, mainly due to their long phosphorescence lifetimes. Herein, a robust purely organic RTP molecule, 3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;phenylindolo[3,2&#8208;a]carbazol&#8208;12(5H)&#8208;yl)&#8208;xanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT), is developed. The neat film of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT shows strong green RTP with a very short lifetime (2.9&#8197;&#956;s) and a high photoluminescence quantum yield (72&#8201;%), and behaviors balanced bipolar charge transport. The RTP nature of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT is validated by steady&#8208;state and transient absorption and emission spectroscopies, and the working mechanism is deciphered by theoretical simulation. Non&#8208;doped multilayer OLEDs using thin neat films of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT furnish an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.91&#8201;% with an extremely low roll&#8208;off (1.6&#8201;%) at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. High&#8208;performance non&#8208;doped top&#8208;emitting and tandem OLEDs are also achieved, providing remarkable EQEs of 24.53&#8201;% and 42.50&#8201;%, respectively. Delightfully, non&#8208;doped simplified OLEDs employing thick neat films of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT are also realized, furnishing an excellent EQE of 17.79&#8201;% and greatly enhanced operational lifetime. The temperature&#8208;dependent and transient EL spectroscopies demonstrate the electrophosphorescence attribute of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT. These non&#8208;doped OLEDs are the best devices based on purely organic RTP materials reported so far.

         <title>Robust, Efficient, and Recoverable Thermocells with Zwitterion&#8208;Boosted Hydrogel Electrolytes for Energy&#8208;Autonomous and Wearable Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds strategy is employed to simultaneously enhance the mechanical properties and thermoelectrochemical performance of flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state thermocells (TECs). This is realized by introducing a zwitterion&#8208;boosted hydrogel electrolyte. The as&#8208;fabricated TECs exhibit substantially improved overall performance, with the capability to repeatedly recover from severe mechanical damages through sol&#8208;gel transformations, demonstrating high potential in energy&#8208;autonomous wearable applications.







Abstract
The rapid growth of flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state thermocells (TECs) provides a fresh way forward for wearable electronics. However, their insufficient mechanical strength and power output still hinder their further applications. This work demonstrates a one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds strategy to synergistically enhance the mechanical and thermoelectrochemical properties of the [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;/4&#8722;&#8208;based TECs. By introducing Hofmeister effect and multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions via betaine zwitterions, the mechanical strength of the conventional brittle gelatin hydrogel electrolytes is substantially improved from 50 to 440&#8197;kPa, with a high stretchability approaching 250&#8201;%. Meanwhile, the betaine zwitterions strongly affect the solvation structure of [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; ions, thus enlarging the entropy difference and raising the thermoelectrochemical Seebeck coefficient from 1.47 to 2.2&#8197;mV&#8201;K&#8722;1. The resultant quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state TECs exhibit a normalized output power density of 0.48&#8197;mW&#8201;m&#8722;2 K&#8722;2, showing a notable improvement in overall performance compared to their counterparts without zwitterion regulation. The intrinsic thermo&#8208;reversible property also allows the TECs to repeatedly self&#8208;recover through sol&#8208;gel transformations, ensuring reliable energy output and even recycling of TECs in case of extreme mechanical damages. An energy&#8208;autonomous smart glove consisting of eighteen individual TECs is further designed, which can simultaneously monitor the temperature of different positions on any touched object, demonstrating high potential in wearable applications.

&lt;p&gt;A one-stone-two-birds strategy is employed to simultaneously enhance the mechanical properties and thermoelectrochemical performance of flexible quasi-solid-state thermocells (TECs). This is realized by introducing a zwitterion-boosted hydrogel electrolyte. The as-fabricated TECs exhibit substantially improved overall performance, with the capability to repeatedly recover from severe mechanical damages through sol-gel transformations, demonstrating high potential in energy-autonomous wearable applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid growth of flexible quasi-solid-state thermocells (TECs) provides a fresh way forward for wearable electronics. However, their insufficient mechanical strength and power output still hinder their further applications. This work demonstrates a one-stone-two-birds strategy to synergistically enhance the mechanical and thermoelectrochemical properties of the [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;/4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-based TECs. By introducing Hofmeister effect and multiple non-covalent interactions via betaine zwitterions, the mechanical strength of the conventional brittle gelatin hydrogel electrolytes is substantially improved from 50 to 440&#8197;kPa, with a high stretchability approaching 250&#8201;%.

         <title>NETosis&#8208;Inspired Cell Surface&#8208;Constrained Framework Nucleic Acids Traps (FNATs) for Cascaded Extracellular Recognition and Cellular Behavior Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon pathogenic stimulation, activated neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), capturing and killing microbes. Inspired by this, we introduce framework nucleic acid traps (FNATs), a DNA nanoplatform for dynamic molecule recognition and cellular behavior modulation. This platform visualizes extracellular activities and manipulates cell behaviors using programmable DNA devices.







Abstract
Upon pathogenic stimulation, activated neutrophils release nuclear DNA into the extracellular environment, forming web&#8208;like DNA structures known as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which capture and kill bacteria, fungi, and cancer cells. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as NETosis. Inspired by this, we introduce a cell surface&#8208;constrained web&#8208;like framework nucleic acids traps (FNATs) with programmable extracellular recognition capability and cellular behavior modulation. This approach facilitates dynamic key chemical signaling molecule recognition such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is elevated in the extracellular microenvironment, and triggers FNA self&#8208;assembly. This, in turn, leads to in situ tightly interwoven FNAs formation on the cell surface, thereby inhibiting target cell migration. Furthermore, it activates a photosensitizer&#8208;capturing switch, chlorin e6 (Ce6), and induces cell self&#8208;destruction. This cascade platform provides new potential tools for visualizing dynamic extracellular activities and manipulating cellular behaviors using programmable in situ self&#8208;assembling DNA molecular devices.

         <title>To DISP or Not? The Far&#8208;Reaching Reaction Mechanisms Underpinning Lithium&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Views on the mechanism of metal&#8208;air batteries have seen a remarkable number of U&#8208;turns, which changed paradigms on how to improve performance. The latest findings show that the disproportionation (DISP) step in the (dis)charge mechanism emerges as the pivot point for explaining rate and capacity limitation as well as the origin of side reactions. Therefrom, directions emerge for materials design to enable high rate and high reversible capacity.







Abstract
The short history of research on Li&#8722;O2 batteries has seen a remarkable number of mechanistic U&#8208;turns over the years. From the initial use of carbonate electrolytes, that were then found to be entirely unsuitable, to the belief that (su)peroxide was solely responsible for degradation, before the more reactive singlet oxygen was found to form, to the hypothesis that capacity depends on a competing surface/solution mechanism before a practically exclusive solution mechanism was identified. Herein, we argue for an ever&#8208;fresh look at the reported data without bias towards supposedly established explanations. We explain how the latest findings on rate and capacity limits, as well as the origin of side reactions, are connected via the disproportionation (DISP) step in the (dis)charge mechanism. Therefrom, directions emerge for the design of electrolytes and mediators on how to suppress side reactions and to enable high rate and high reversible capacity.

         <title>Interlayer Structure Manipulation of FeOCl/MXene with Soft/Hard Interface Design for Safe Water Production Using Dechlorination Battery Deionization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The soft/hard interfaces assembly was designed by manipulating the interlayer structure, in which Ti3C2Tx dressed the fragile FeOCl with a soft and conductive suit, solving the thorny troubles of structural stability and electronic conductivity for FeOCl. The rigidity and flexibility integrated FeOCl/Ti3C2Tx worked for electrochemical dechlorination with simultaneous energy recovery, demonstrating the feasibility of dechlorination battery.







Abstract
Suffering from the susceptibility to decomposition, the potential electrochemical application of FeOCl has greatly been hindered. The rational design of the soft&#8208;hard material interface can effectively address the challenge of stress concentration and thus decomposition that may occur in the electrodes during charging and discharging. Herein, interlayer structure manipulation of FeOCl/MXene using soft&#8208;hard interface design method were conducted for electrochemical dechlorination. FeOCl was encapsulated in Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets by electrostatic self&#8208;assembly layer by layer to form a soft&#8208;hard mechanical hierarchical structure, in which Ti3C2Tx was used as flexible buffer layers to relieve the huge volume change of FeOCl during Cl&#8722; intercalation/deintercalation and constructed a conductive network for fast charge transfer. The CDI dechlorination system of FeOCl/Ti3C2Tx delivered outstanding Cl&#8722; adsorption capacity (158.47 &#177; 6.98&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), rate (6.07 &#177; 0.35&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1), and stability (over 94.49&#8201;% in 30 cycles), and achieved considerable energy recovery (21.14 &#177; 0.25&#8201;%). The superior dechlorination performance was proved to originate from the Fe2+/Fe3+ topochemical transformation and the deformation constraint effect of Ti3C2Tx on FeOCl. Our interfacial design strategy enables a hard&#8208;to&#8208;soft integration capacity, which can serve as a universal technology for solving the traditional problem of electrode volume expansion.

         <title>Ternary Rotational Polyanion Coupling Enables Fast Li Ion Dynamics in Tetrafluoroborate Ion Doped Antiperovskite Li2OHCl Solid Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Knowledge on the Li ion dynamics associated with more than two types of polyanions is still lacking. In this work, a novel three&#8208;body responsive dynamics is stimulated by the ternary coupling of OH&#8722;, BF4&#8722; and Li2&#8722;O&#8722;H octahedron movements, which efficiently reduces the activation barrier and consequently improves the Li ion conductivity.







Abstract
Li&#8208;rich antiperovskite (LiRAP) hydroxyhalides are emerging as attractive solid electrolyte (SEs) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMBs) due to their low melting point, low cost, and ease of scaling&#8208;up. The incorporation of rotational polyanions can reduce the activation energy and thus improve the Li ion conductivity of SEs. Herein, we propose a ternary rotational polyanion coupling strategy to fasten the Li ion conduction in tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8722;) ion doped LiRAP Li2OHCl. Assisted by first&#8208;principles calculation, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, solid&#8208;state magnetic resonance and electrochemical impedance spectra, it is confirmed that Li ion transport in BF4&#8722; ion doped Li2OHCl is strongly associated with the rotational coupling among OH&#8722;, BF4&#8722; and Li2&#8722;O&#8722;H octahedrons, which enhances the Li ion conductivity for more than 1.8&#8197;times with the activation energy lowering 0.03&#8197;eV. This work provides a new perspective to design high&#8208;performance superionic conductors with multi&#8208;polyanions.

         <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Driven 1,4&#8208;Aryl Migration via Radical Fluoromethylation of N&#8208;Allylbenzamides: a Straightforward Access to Functionalized &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines</title>

         <dc:description>
An electrochemical difluoro&#8208; and trifluoromethylation of N&#8208;allylbenzamides triggers the 1,4&#8208;migration of the aromatic ring through a radical Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement. This transformation offers a straightforward access to valuable &#946;&#8208;arylethylamine derivatives in good yields and under mild reaction conditions from readily available starting materials.







Abstract
An electrochemical radical Truce Smiles rearrangement of N&#8208;allylbenzamides is documented herein. The selective 1,4&#8208;aryl migration was triggered by the radical fluoromethylation of the alkene providing a direct route to fluoro derivatives of the highly privileged &#946;&#8208;arylethylamine pharmacophore. This practical transformation utilizes readily available starting materials and employs an electrical current to drive the oxidative process under mild reaction conditions. It accommodates a variety of migratory aryl groups with different electronic properties and substitution patterns. Careful selection of the protecting group on the nitrogen atom of the N&#8208;allylbenzamide is crucial to outcompete the undesired 6&#8208;endo cyclization and achieve high level of selectivity towards the 1,4&#8208;aryl migration. DFT calculations support the reaction mechanism and unveil the origin of selectivity between the two competitive pathways.

         <title>Pyridinium&#8208;Yne Click Polymerization: A Facile Strategy toward Functional Poly(Vinylpyridinium Salt)s with Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria Killing Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient pyridinium&#8208;yne click polymerization was successfully established, resulting in a series of poly(vinylpyridinium salt)s with satisfactory molecular weight and well&#8208;defined structure. The resulting polymers exhibit low cytotoxicity, excellent luminescent properties, and most importantly, demonstrate excellent broad&#8208;spectrum bactericidal efficacy against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria.







Abstract
Polymeric materials with antibacterial properties hold great promise for combating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria, which pose a significant threat to public health. However, the synthesis of most antibacterial polymers typically involves complicated and time&#8208;consuming procedures. In this study, we demonstrate a simple and efficient strategy for synthesizing functional poly(vinylpyridinium salt)s via pyridinium&#8208;yne click polymerization. This click polymerization could proceed with high atom economy under mild conditions without any external catalyst, yielding soluble and thermally stable poly(vinylpyridinium salt)s with satisfactory molecular weights and well&#8208;defined structures in excellent yields. Additionally, the incorporation of luminescent units such as fluorene, tetraphenylethylene, and triphenylamine into the polymer backbone confers excellent aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission properties upon the resulting polymers, rendering them suitable for bacterial staining. Moreover, the existence of pyridinium salt imparts intrinsic antibacterial activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria to the polymers, enabling them to effectively inhibit wound bacterial infection and significantly expedite the healing process. This work not only provides an efficient method to prepare antibacterial polymers, but also opens up the possibility of various applications of polymers in healthcare and other antibacterial fields.

         <title>Acyclic Cucurbit[n]uril Receptors Function as Solid State Sequestrants for Organic Micropollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In previous work, we showed that water soluble acyclic cucurbit[n]uril hosts function well as in vivo sequestrants for biologically active substances. Herein, we synthesize a series of water insoluble 3,6&#8208;dimethylcatechol walled acyclic CB[n] and demonstrate their function as solid state sequestrants for organic micropollutants.







Abstract
The accumulation of organic micropollutants (OMP) in aquatic systems is a major societal problem that can be addressed by approaches including nanofiltration, flocculation, reverse osmosis and adsorptive methods using insoluble materials (e.g. activated carbon, MOFs, nanocomposites). More recently, polymeric versions of supramolecular hosts (e.g. cyclodextrins, calixarenes, pillararenes) have been investigated as OMP sequestrants. Herein, we report our study of the use of water insoluble dimethylcatechol walled acyclic cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) hosts as solid state sequestrants for a panel of five OMPs. A series of hosts (H1&#8211;H4) were synthesized by reaction of glycoluril oligomer (monomer&#8211;tetramer) with 3,6&#8208;dimethylcatechol and fully characterized by spectroscopic means and x&#8208;ray crystallography. The solid hosts sequester OMPs from water with removal efficiencies exceeding 90&#8201;% in some cases. The removal efficiencies of the new hosts parallel the known molecular recognition properties of analogous water soluble acyclic CB[n]. OMP uptake by solid host occurs rapidly (&#8776;120&#8197;seconds). Head&#8208;to&#8208;head comparison with CB[6] in batch&#8208;mode separation and DARCO activated carbon in flow&#8208;through separation mode show that tetramer derived host (H4) performs very well under identical conditions. The work establishes insoluble acyclic CB[n]&#8208;type receptors as a promising new platform for OMP sequestration.

         <title>tert&#8208;Butyl as a Functional Group: Non&#8208;Directed Catalytic Hydroxylation of Sterically Congested Primary C&#8722;H Bonds</title>

Materials and methods describing preparation of substrates, characterization of isolated oxidation products and experimental procedures for the catalytic reactions; supplementary text, Figures&#8197;S1&#8211;S6, Tables&#8197;S1&#8211;S94 and NMR spectra.







Abstract
The tert&#8208;butyl group is a common aliphatic motif extensively employed to implement steric congestion and conformational rigidity in organic and organometallic molecules. Because of the combination of a high bond dissociation energy (~100&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and limited accessibility, in the absence of directing groups, neither radical nor organometallic approaches are effective for the chemical modification of tert&#8208;butyl C&#8722;H bonds. Herein we overcome these limits by employing a highly electrophilic manganese catalyst, [Mn(CF3bpeb)(OTf)2], that operates in the strong hydrogen bond donor solvent nonafluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl alcohol (NFTBA) and catalytically activates hydrogen peroxide to generate a powerful manganese&#8208;oxo species that effectively oxidizes tert&#8208;butyl C&#8722;H bonds. Leveraging on the interplay of steric, electronic, medium and torsional effects, site&#8208;selective and product chemoselective hydroxylation of the tert&#8208;butyl group is accomplished with broad reaction scope, delivering primary alcohols as largely dominant products in preparative yields. Late&#8208;stage hydroxylation at tert&#8208;butyl sites is demonstrated on 6 densely functionalized molecules of pharmaceutical interest. This work uncovers a novel disconnection approach, harnessing tert&#8208;butyl as a potential functional group in strategic synthetic planning for complex molecular architectures.

         <title>Assembly of Glycopeptides in Living Cells Resembling Viral Infection for Cargo Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycosylated peptide is designed to formulate SgVEIP that exhibits cancer cell targeting and enzyme&#8208;responsive properties arising from the galactose&#8208;galectin&#8208;1 association and galactosidase&#8208;induced hydrolysis. Precursor SgVEIP undergoes an in situ cascade targeting&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;transformation assembly resembling to viral infection in a holistic manner, thus allowing for efficient delivery of irinotecan and peptide drugs to kill cancer cells.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly in living cells represents one versatile strategy for drug delivery; however, it suffers from the limited precision and efficiency. Inspired by viral traits, we here report a cascade targeting&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;transformation (THT) assembly of glycosylated peptides in living cells holistically resembling viral infection for efficient cargo delivery and combined tumor therapy.

&lt;p&gt;A glycosylated peptide is designed to formulate &lt;b&gt;SgVEIP&lt;/b&gt; that exhibits cancer cell targeting and enzyme-responsive properties arising from the galactose-galectin-1 association and galactosidase-induced hydrolysis. Precursor &lt;b&gt;SgVEIP&lt;/b&gt; undergoes an in situ cascade targeting-hydrolysis-transformation assembly resembling to viral infection in a holistic manner, thus allowing for efficient delivery of irinotecan and peptide drugs to kill cancer cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-assembly in living cells represents one versatile strategy for drug delivery; however, it suffers from the limited precision and efficiency. Inspired by viral traits, we here report a cascade targeting-hydrolysis-transformation (THT) assembly of glycosylated peptides in living cells holistically resembling viral infection for efficient cargo delivery and combined tumor therapy. We design a glycosylated peptide via incorporating a &#946;-galactose-serine residue into bola-amphiphilic sequences. Co-assembling of the glycosylated peptide with two counterparts containing irinotecan (IRI) or ligand TSFAEYWNLLSP (PMI) results in formation of the glycosylated co-assemblies &lt;b&gt;SgVEIP&lt;/b&gt;, which target cancer cells via &#946;-galactose-galectin-1 association and undergo galactosidase-induced morphological transformation. While GSH-reduction causes release of IRI from the co-assemblies, the PMI moieties release p53 and facilitate cell death via binding with protein MDM2. Cellular experiments show membrane targeting, endo-/lysosome-mediated internalization and in situ formation of nanofibers in cytoplasm by &lt;b&gt;SgVEIP&lt;/b&gt;. This cascade THT process enables efficient delivery of IRI and PMI into cancer cells secreting Gal-1 and overexpressing &#946;-galactosidase. In vivo studies illustrate enhanced tumor accumulation and retention of the glycosylated co-assemblies, thereby suppressing tumor growth. Our findings demonstrate an in situ assembly strategy mimicking viral infection, thus providing a new route for drug delivery and cancer therapy in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>[2+1] Cycloadditions Modulate the Hydrophobicity of Ni&#8208;N4 Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[2+1] Cycloaddition of difluorocarbene onto N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported Ni&#8208;N4 catalysts is successfully realized, leading to the covalent attachment of &#8722;CF2&#8722; groups on the catalyst. The microenvironment of Ni&#8208;N4 sites is changed from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic after installing &#8722;CF2&#8722; groups, which inhibits hydrogen evolution and thus favors CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Microenvironment regulation of M&#8208;N4 single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is a promising way to tune their catalytic properties toward the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. However, strategies that can effectively introduce functional groups around the M&#8208;N4 sites through strong covalent bonding and under mild reaction conditions are highly desired. Taking the hydrophilic Ni&#8208;N4 SAC as a representative, we report herein a [2+1] cycloaddition reaction between Ni&#8208;N4 and in situ generated difluorocarbene (F2C:), and enable the surface fluorocarbonation of Ni&#8208;N4, resulting in the formation of a super&#8208;hydrophobic Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;CF2 catalyst. Meanwhile, the mild reaction conditions allow Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;CF2 to inherit both the electronic and structural configuration of the Ni&#8208;N4 sites from Ni&#8208;N4. Enhanced electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Faradaic efficiency above 98&#8201;% is achieved in a wide operating potential window from &#8722;0.7&#8197;V to &#8722;1.3&#8197;V over Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;CF2. In situ spectroelectrochemical studies reveal that a highly hydrophobic microenvironment formed by the &#8722;CF2&#8722; group repels asymmetric H&#8208;bonded water at the electrified interface, inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction and promoting CO production. This work highlights the advantages of [2+1] cycloaddition reactions on the covalent modification of N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported catalysts.

         <title>A High&#8208;Mobility n&#8208;Type Noncovalently&#8208;Fused&#8208;Ring Polymer for High&#8208;Performance Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated polymers are emerging as competitive candidates for organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). However, to make the device truly pervasive, both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type conjugated polymers are essential. Despite great efforts, no n&#8208;type equivalents to the p&#8208;type benchmark PEDOT:PSS exist to date mainly due to the low electrical conductivity (&#963;). Herein, a near&#8208;amorphous n&#8208;type conjugated polymer, namely pDFSe, is reported with high &#963; by achieving the synergy between charge transport and doping efficiency. The polymer pDFSe is synthesized based on an acceptor&#8208;triad moiety of diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;difluorobenzoselenadiazole&#8208;diketopyrrolopyrrole (DFSe), which has the noncovalently&#8208;fused&#8208;ring structure to reinforce the backbone rigidity. Furthermore, an axisymmetric thiophene&#8208;selenophene&#8208;thiophene donor is introduced, which enables the formation of near&#8208;amorphous microstructures. The above merits ensure good doping efficiency without scarifying efficient intrachain charge&#8208;carrier transport. Thus, pDFSe&#8208;based n&#8208;type transistors exhibit high electron mobility up to 6.15 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, much higher than its reference polymer pDSe without the noncovalently&#8208;fused&#8208;ring structure (0.77 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). Further upon n&#8208;doping, pDFSe demonstrates excellent &#963; of 62.6 S cm&#8722;1 and maximum power factor of 133.1 &#956;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, which are among the highest values reported for solution&#8208;processed n&#8208;type polymers. The results demonstrate the great potential of near&#8208;amorphous n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with noncovalently&#8208;fused&#8208;ring structure for the next&#8208;generation OTEs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Halogen&#8208;Bonded Fluorescent Molecular Photoswitch: Transition from 3D Cubic Lattice to 1D Helical Superstructure for Polarization Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of materials that can switch between circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals is both essential and challenging. Here, two new halogen&#8208;bonded fluorescent molecular photoswitches, namely, HB&#8208;switch 1 and HB&#8208;switch 2, containing &#945;&#8208;cyano&#8208;substituted diarylethene compounds with different end groups were developed. Upon exposure to specific UV or visible light wavelengths, they exhibited controllable and reversible Z/E photoisomerization. When these switches were integrated into blue&#8208;phase liquid crystals (BPLCs), the temperature range of BP significantly expanded. Notably, the BP system incorporating HB&#8208;switch 1 exclusively achieved reversible polarization inversion of CPL signals under specific UV/visible light irradiation and during cooling/heating. The photo/thermal dual&#8208;response behavior of the CPL signals can be attributed to the phase transition from a high&#8208;symmetry 3D BP I lattice to a low&#8208;symmetry 1D helical superstructure induced by the Z/E photoisomerization of HB&#8208;switch 1 and temperature changes. This study underscores the significance of employing halogen&#8208;bond assembly strategies to design materials with switchable CPL signals, opening new possibilities for CPL&#8208;active systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>S(VI) compounds with multiple N or O substituents are &#160;often difficult to make and several crucial routes, such as multimodal SuFEx (Sulfur (VI) Fluoride Exchange) chemistry, rely on the highly useful but hazardous SOF4 gas. Safety issues and inaccessibility of SOF4 strongly hamper the developments of these organic compounds. Here we describe the synthesis and applications of 2&#8208;methylimidazole&#8208;1&#8208;(N&#8208;tert&#8208;octyl)sulfonimidoyl fluoride (ImSF), a novel bench&#8208;stable analogue of SOF4. ImSF is synthesized on a gram scale via a double fluorination of t&#8208;OctNSO. We show ImSF can undergo substitution reactions with phenols and amines, which lead to sulfurimidates and sulfuramidimidates, respectively, the intrinsically chiral analogous of medicinally relevant sulfates and sulfamates in which an S=O moiety is replaced by S=NR unit. Finally we demonstrate that such substitutions can occur enantiospecifically, providing the first entry to chiral sulfurimidates and sulfuramidimidates.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of a Mixed Arduengo&#8208;Fischer Carbodicarbene Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbodicarbenes are strong C&#8208;donor ligands, which have found numerous applications in organometallic and main group element chemistry. Herein, we report a structurally distinct carbodicarbene ligand, which is formed by dinitrogenative coupling of a Fischer carbene complex with an N&#8208;heterocyclic diazoolefin. The resulting carbonyl complex serves as a stable source for the mixed Arduengo&#8208;Fischer carbodicarbene ligand. Facile ligand transfer reactions were demonstrated to occur with gold(I), copper(I), palladium(II), and rhodium(I) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Stabilization Effects of Benzylhydrazine on Scalable Perovskite Precursor Inks for Improved Perovskite Solar Cell Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite precursor inks suffer various forms of degradation, such as iodide anion oxidation and organic cation breakdown, hindering reliable perovskite solar cell manufacturing. Here we report that benzylhydrazine hydrochloride (BHC) not only retards the buildup of iodine as previously reported but also prevents the breakdown of organic cations. Through investigating BHC and iodine chemical reactions, we elucidate protonation and dehydration mechanisms, converting BHC to harmless volatile compounds, thus preserving perovskite film crystallization and solar cell performance. This inhibition effect lasts nearly a month with minimal BHC, contrasting control inks without BHC where organic cations fully react in less than a week. This enhanced understanding, from additive stabilization to end products, promises improved perovskite solar cell production reliability.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Copper Dinitrogen Complex Supported by a Weakly Coordinating Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and full characterization of the copper dinitrogen complex [(&#951;1&#8208;N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] 2 (RF = C(CF3)3) prepared by a cascade metathesis reaction of Ag[Al(ORF)4] with CuI&#8208;excess in iso&#8208;perfluorohexane (i&#8208;pfh) under N2 atmosphere. Title compound 2 features an extraordinarily high N2 stretching frequency at 2313/2314&#160;cm&#8208;1 (IR/Raman) and was characterized by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffractometry. Quantum chemical charge displacement analysis based on natural orbitals of chemical valence (CD&#8208;NOCV) indicates that the copper&#8208;dinitrogen interaction is still governed by weak &#960;&#8208;backdonation, but is significantly reduced compared to all literature&#8208;known transition metal dinitrogen complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Broad protection against invasive fungal disease from a nanobody targeting the active site of fungal b&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucanosyltransferases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Invasive fungal disease accounts for ~3.8 million deaths annually, an unacceptable rate that urgently prompts the discovery of new knowledge&#8208;driven treatments. We report the use of camelid single&#8208;domain nanobodies (Nbs) against fungal &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucanosyltransferases (Gel) involved in &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucan transglycosylation. Crystal structures of two Nbs with Gel4 from Aspergillus fumigatus revealed binding to a dissimilar CBM43 domain and a highly conserved catalytic domain across fungal species, respectively. Anti&#8208;Gel4 active site Nb3 showed significant antifungal efficacy in vitro and in vivo prophylactically and therapeutically against different A. fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans isolates, reducing the fungal burden and disease severity, thus significantly improving immunocompromised animal survival. Notably, C. deneoformans (serotype D) strains were more susceptible to Nb3 and genetic Gel deletion than C. neoformans (serotype A) strains, indicating a key role for &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucan remodelling in C. deneoformans survival. These findings add new insights about the role of b&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucan in fungal biology and demonstrate the potential of nanobodies in targeting fungal enzymes to combat invasive fungal diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Complex&#8208;Templated Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry for the Selection and Identification of Homo&#8208;PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry meets PROTAC screening: Stability of ternary complexes formed by PROTACs is shown to act as selection criterion in multi&#8208;protein templated dynamic combinatorial libraries. Reversible thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange chemistry allows rapid identification of novel VHL&#8208;targeting Homo&#8208;PROTACs from complex library mixtures.







Abstract
Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) leverages a reversible reaction to generate compound libraries from constituting building blocks under thermodynamic control. The position of this equilibrium can be biased by addition of a target macromolecule towards enrichment of bound ligands. While DCC has been applied to select ligands for a single target protein, its application to identifying chimeric molecules inducing proximity between two proteins is unprecedented. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we develop a DCC approach to select bifunctional proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) based on their ability to stabilize the ternary complex. We focus on VHL&#8208;targeting Homo&#8208;PROTACs as model system, and show that the formation of a VHL2&#8201;:&#8201;Homo&#8208;PROTAC ternary complex reversibly assembled using thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange chemistry leads to amplification of potent VHL Homo&#8208;PROTACs with degradation activities which correlated well with their biophysical ability to dimerize VHL. Ternary complex templated dynamic combinatorial libraries allowed identification of novel Homo&#8208;PROTAC degraders. We anticipate future applications of ternary&#8208;complex directed DCC to early PROTAC screenings and expansion to other proximity&#8208;inducing modalities beyond PROTACs.

         <title>A Dicopper(II)&#8208;Based Carbonic Anhydrase Model&#8212;Quantum&#8208;Chemical Evaluation of the Mechanistic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prochloron didemni, an obligate symbiont of ascidians produces large amounts of patellamides, known to form dinuclear copper(II) complexes, which are efficient carbonic anhydrases. However, at the pH in the ascidians, catalysis is shown to be product&#8208;inhibited. All data available support the hypothesis that the function of the patellamides is to transport carbonate from the ascidian to the photosynthetically active symbiont Prochloron.







Abstract
The cyanobacterium Prochloron didemni, an obligate symbiont of different species of colonial ascidians, occurring in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, produces a variety of cyclic peptides. These patellamide&#8208;type macrocycles lead to relatively stable dicopper(II) complexes that are extremely efficient carbonic anhydrase mimics, the most active model systems known so far. Importantly, it recently was shown that copper(II) is coordinated to patellamide derivatives in Prochloron cells. An interesting question therefore is, whether the biological function of patellamide&#8208;type macrocycles is related to the catalytic activity in CO2 hydration or its reverse. Here, we present a computational study to evaluate the energetics of the catalytic cycle in search of a possible answer to these questions and compare the computed energy barriers with the experimental kinetic data. It emerges that release of the bridging carbonate is a critical step and that the catalysis product inhibits catalysis at pH values above approx.&#8197;7. Therefore, carbonate transport rather than CO2 hydrolysis is proposed as the biological function of copper(II)&#8208;patellamide complexes in the Prochloron&#8208;Ascidian symbiosis.

         <title>Engineering of Halide Methyltransferase BxHMT through Dynamic Cross&#8208;Correlation Network Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine assumes a crucial role in biocatalytic alkylation. To improve the catalytic ability of BxHMT towards methyl toluene sulfonate, a strategy named dynamic cross&#8208;correlation network analysis (DCCNA) was proposed for the identification of potential mutation sites, both distal and proximal. Experimental results proved the efficiency of the approach, which is expected to be a useful tool for other enzyme engineering studies.







Abstract
Halide methyltransferases (HMTs) provide an effective way to regenerate S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM) from S&#8208;adenosyl homocysteine and reactive electrophiles, such as methyl iodide (MeI) and methyl toluene sulfonate (MeOTs). As compared with MeI, the cost&#8208;effective unnatural substrate MeOTs can be accessed directly from cheap and abundant alcohols, but shows only limited reactivity in SAM production. In this study, we developed a dynamic cross&#8208;correlation network analysis (DCCNA) strategy for quickly identifying hot spots influencing the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, and applied it to the evolution of HMT from Paraburkholderia xenovorans. Finally, the optimal mutant, M4 (V55T/C125S/L127T/L129P), exhibited remarkable improvement, with a specific activity of 4.08&#8197;U/mg towards MeOTs, representing an 82&#8208;fold increase as compared to the wild&#8208;type (WT) enzyme. Notably, M4 also demonstrated a positive impact on the catalytic ability with other methyl donors. The structural mechanism behind the enhanced enzyme activity was uncovered by molecular dynamics simulations. Our work not only contributes a promising biocatalyst for the regeneration of SAM, but also offers a strategy for efficient enzyme engineering.

         <title>Stabilization of Pd0 by Cu Alloying: Theory&#8208;Guided Design of Pd3Cu Electrocatalyst for Anodic Methanol Carbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the anodic electrocarbonylation of methanol to produce DMC, our theoretical studies suggest Cu&#8722;Pd alloy not only stabilizes Pd0, the true active site, but also reduces the overall energy barrier for DMC formation. The theoretically predicted Pd3Cu, synthesized by a two&#8208;step thermal shock method, achieves FEDMC of 93&#8201;%@1.0&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl, far surpassing existing Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbonylation of CO and CH3OH to dimethyl carbonate (DMC) on metallic palladium (Pd) electrode offers a promising strategy for C1 valorization at the anode. However, its broader application is limited by the high working potential and the low DMC selectivity accompanied with severe methanol self&#8208;oxidation. Herein, our theoretical analysis of the intermediate adsorption interactions on both Pd0 and Pd4+ surfaces revealed that inevitable reconstruction of Pd surface under strongly oxidative potential diminishes its CO adsorption capacity, thus damaging the DMC formation. Further theoretical modeling indicates that doping Pd with Cu not only stabilizes low&#8208;valence Pd in oxidative environments but also lowers the overall energy barrier for DMC formation. Guided by this insight, we developed a facile two&#8208;step thermal shock method to prepare PdCu alloy electrocatalysts for DMC. Remarkably, the predicted Pd3Cu demonstrated the highest DMC selectivity among existing Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts, reaching a peaked DMC selectivity of 93&#8201;% at 1.0&#8197;V versus Ag/AgCl electrode. (Quasi) in situ spectra investigations further confirmed the predicted dual role of Cu dopant in promoting Pd&#8208;catalyzed DMC formation.

         <title>Tuning Electron Delocalization of Redox&#8208;Active Porous Aromatic Framework for Low&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zn&#8722;K Hybrid Batteries with Air Self&#8208;Chargeability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the first case of applying redox&#8208;active porous organic polymer for aqueous Zn&#8722;K hybrid batteries with air self&#8208;chargeability, presenting a redox chemistry with K+ as the charge carriers and regulates Zn&#8208;ion solvation chemistry to guide uniform Zn plating/stripping, thus showing the impressively electrochemical properties in bending, all&#8208;climate and air self&#8208;charging conditions.







Abstract
Air self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries promise to integrate energy harvesting technology and battery systems, potentially overcoming a heavy reliance on energy and the spatiotemporal environment. However, the exploitation of multifunctional air self&#8208;charging battery systems using promising cathode materials and suitable charge carriers remains challenging. Herein, for the first time, we developed low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;charging aqueous Zn&#8722;K hybrid ion batteries (AZKHBs) using a fully conjugated hexaazanonaphthalene (HATN)&#8208;based porous aromatic framework as the cathode material, exhibiting redox chemistry using K+ as charge carriers, and regulating Zn&#8208;ion solvation chemistry to guide uniform Zn plating/stripping. The unique AZKHBs exhibit the exceptional electrochemical properties in all&#8208;climate conditions. Most importantly, the large potential difference causes the AZKHBs discharged cathode to be oxidized using oxygen, thereby initiating a self&#8208;charging process in the absence of an external power source. Impressively, the air self&#8208;charging AZKHBs can achieve a maximum voltage of 1.15&#8197;V, an impressive discharge capacity (466.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and exceptional self&#8208;charging performance even at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. Therefore, the development of self&#8208;charging AZKHBs offers a solution to the limitations imposed by the absence of a power grid in harsh environments or remote areas.

         <title>Paper Spray Mass Spectrometry with On&#8208;Paper Electrokinetic Manipulations: Part&#8208;Per&#8208;Trillion Detection of Per/Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in Water and Opioids in Urine</title>

         <dc:description>
A paper&#8208;based device that combines electrokinetic stacking and separations with MS ionization is developed to enable trace analysis without prior sample preparation. Sub part&#8208;per&#8208;trillion detection of harmful per/polyfluoroalkyl substances from tap water in 10&#8197;minutes is demonstrated.







Abstract
We developed a simple, paper&#8208;based device that enables sensitive detection by mass spectrometry (MS) without solid phase extraction or other sample preparation. Using glass fiber filter papers within a 3D printed holder, the device employs electrokinetic manipulations to stack, separate, and desalt charged molecules on paper prior to spray into the MS. Due to counter&#8208;balanced electroosmotic flow and electrophoresis, charged analytes stack on the paper and desalting occurs in minutes. One end of the paper strip was cut into a sharp point and positioned near the inlet of a MS. The stacked analyte bands move toward the paper tip with the EOF where they are ionized by paper spray. The device was applied to analysis of PFAS in tap water with sub part&#8208;per&#8208;trillion detection limits in less than ten minutes with no sample pretreatment. Analysis of opioids in urine also occurs in minutes. The crucial parameters to enable stacking, separation, and MS ionization of both positively and negatively charged analytes were determined and optimized. Experimental and computational modeling studies confirm the electrokinetic stacking and analyte transport mechanisms. On&#8208;paper separations were carried out by stacking analyte bands at different locations depending on their electrophoretic mobility, achieving baseline separation in some cases.

An open&#8208;shell conjugated polymer has been synthesized with the ultralow&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels (&#8722;4.63&#8197;eV) and high&#8208;spin ground&#8208;state, affording a high intrinsic conductivity of 1.04&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 without additional dopants and a power factor of 12.59&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 in organic thermoelectrics.







Abstract
Open&#8208;shell conjugated polymers with a high intrinsic conductivity and high&#8208;spin ground state hold considerable promise for applications in organic electronics and spintronics. Herein, two novel acceptor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8211;A) conjugated polymers based on a highly electron&#8208;deficient quinoidal benzodifurandione unit have been developed, namely DPP&#8208;BFDO&#8208;Th and DPP&#8208;BFDO. The incorporation of the quinoidal moiety into the polymers backbones enables deeply aligned lower&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of below &#8722;4.0&#8197;eV. Notably, DPP&#8208;BFDO exhibits an exceptionally low LUMO (&#8722;4.63&#8197;eV) and a high&#8208;spin ground state characterized by strong diradical characters. Moreover, a self&#8208;doping through intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer is observed for DPP&#8208;BFDO, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies. The high carrier concentration in combination with a planar and linear conjugated backbone yields a remarkable electrical conductivity (&#963;) of 1.04&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in the &#8220;undoped&#8221; native form, ranking among the highest values reported for n&#8208;type radical&#8208;based conjugated polymers. When employed as an n&#8208;type thermoelectric material, DPP&#8208;BFDO achieves a power factor of 12.59&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. Furthermore, upon n&#8208;doping, the &#963; could be improved to 65.68&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. This study underscores the great potential of electron&#8208;deficient quinoidal units in constructing dopant&#8208;free n&#8208;type conductive polymers with a high&#8208;spin ground state and exceptional intrinsic conductivity.

         <title>Fabrication of Large&#8208;Area Multi&#8208;Stimulus Responsive Thin Films via Interfacially Confined Irreversible Katritzky Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large&#8208;area, free&#8208;standing, robust and multi&#8208;stimulus responsive thin films were fabricated through a catalyst&#8208;free and irreversible Katritzky reaction at a liquid&#8211;liquid interface. The thin films exhibit fast photo&#8208;mechanical motions, vapor&#8208;mechanical motions, as well as photo&#8208;chromic and solvato&#8208;chromic behaviors. In addition, the films can harvest anionic radicals and the radicals as captured can be efficiently degraded under UV light illumination.







Abstract
Fabrication of large&#8208;area thin films through irreversible reactions remains a formidable task. This study reports a breakthrough strategy for in situ synthesis of large&#8208;area, free&#8208;standing, robust and multi&#8208;stimulus responsive thin films through a catalyst&#8208;free and irreversible Katritzky reaction at a liquid&#8211;liquid interface. The as resulted films are featured with adjustable thickness of 1&#8211;3&#8197;&#956;m and an area up to 50&#8197;cm2. The thin films exhibit fast photo&#8208;mechanical motions (a response time of ca 0.1&#8197;s), vapor&#8208;mechanical motions, as well as photo&#8208;chromic and solvato&#8208;chromic behaviors. It was revealed that the reason behind the observable motions is proton transfer from the imine groups to the carbonyl structures within the film induced by photo&#8208; and/or dimethyl sulfoxide&#8208;stimulus. In addition, the films can harvest anionic radicals and the radicals as captured can be efficiently degraded under UV light illumination. This study provides a new strategy for fabricating smart thin films via interfacially confined irreversible Katritzky reaction.

         <title>Radical Homopolymerization of Linear &#945;&#8208;Olefins Enabled by 1,4&#8208;Cyano Group Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical homopolymerization of linear &#945;&#8208;olefins has been developed. The success of this polymerization relies on the high efficiency of 1,4&#8208;cyano group migration. This approach can be applied to homopolymerize &#945;&#8208; substituted styrenes or acrylates. As a chain transfer agent, a symmetric allylic sulfide is created to regulate the propagating thiyl radicals over the polymerization process.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Olefins are valued and abundant building blocks from fossil resources. They are widely used to provide small&#8208;molecule or polymeric products. Despite numerous advantages of radical polymerization, it has been well&#8208;documented as textbook knowledge that &#945;&#8208;olefins and their functionalized derivatives cannot be radically homopolymerized because of the degradative chain transfer side reactions. Herein, we report our studies on the homopolymerization of thiocyanate functionalized &#945;&#8208;olefins enabled by 1,4&#8208;cyano group migration under radical conditions. By this approach, a library of ABC sequence&#8208;controlled polymers with high molecular weights can be prepared. We can also extend this strategy to the homopolymerization of &#945;&#8208;substituted styrenic and acylate monomers which are known to be challenging to achieve. Overall, the demonstrated functional group migration radical polymerization could provide new possibilities to synthesize polymers with unprecedented main chain sequences and structures. These polymers are promising candidates for novel polymeric materials.

         <title>Construct Phenylethanoid Glycosides Harnessing Biosynthetic Networks, Protein Engineering and One&#8208;Pot Multienzyme Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot multienzyme cascade platform was established to synthesize various phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs). In total 12 catalytic enzymes were characterized to illustrate a complex biosynthetic network; 3&#8197;enzymes were engineered to broaden sugar donor and substrate selectivity; 46&#8197;PhGs could be constructed. PhGs with additional glycosyl and hydroxyl modules demonstrated liver cell protection effect.







Abstract
Phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs) exhibit a multitude of structural variations linked to diverse pharmacological activities. Assembling various PhGs via multienzyme cascades represents a concise strategy over traditional synthetic methods. However, the challenge lies in identifying a comprehensive set of catalytic enzymes. This study explores biosynthetic PhG reconstruction from natural precursors, aiming to replicate and amplify their structural diversity. We discovered 12 catalytic enzymes, including four novel 6&#8242;&#8208;OH glycosyltransferases and three new polyphenol oxidases, revealing the intricate network in PhG biosynthesis. Subsequently, the crystal structure of CmGT3 (2.62&#8197;&#197;) was obtained, guiding the identification of conserved residue 144# as a critical determinant for sugar donor specificity. Engineering this residue in PhG glycosyltransferases (FsGT61, CmGT3, and FsGT6) altered their sugar donor recognition. Finally, a one&#8208;pot multienzyme cascade was established, where the combined action of glycosyltransferases and acyltransferases boosted conversion rates by up to 12.6&#8208;fold. This cascade facilitated the reconstruction of 26&#8197;PhGs with conversion rates ranging from 5&#8211;100&#8201;%, and 20 additional PhGs detectable by mass spectrometry. PhGs with extra glycosyl and hydroxyl modules demonstrated notable liver cell protection. This work not only provides catalytic tools for PhG biosynthesis, but also serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for cell&#8208;free enzymatic construction of diverse natural products.

The nanoclusters exhibit far higher activity than commercial Pt/C catalysts in catalyzing ORR without calcination before use and additional photothermal properties, which are attributed to the special size and structure by DFT and d&#8208;band center calculations.







Abstract
Atomically precise ~1&#8208;nm Pt nanoparticles (nanoclusters, NCs) with ambient stability are important in fundamental research and exhibit diverse practical applications (catalysis, biomedicine, etc.). However, synthesizing such materials is challenging. Herein, by employing the mixture ligand protecting strategy, we successfully synthesized the largest organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;protected (~1&#8208;nm) Pt23 NCs precisely characterized with mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Interestingly, natural population analysis and Bader charge calculation indicate an alternate, varying charge &#8208;layer distribution in the sandwich&#8208;like Pt23 NC kernel. Pt23 NCs can catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction under acidic conditions without requiring calcination and other treatments, and the resulting specific and mass activities without further treatment are sevenfold and eightfold higher than those observed for commercial Pt/C catalysts, respectively. Density functional theory and d&#8208;band center calculations interpret the high activity. Furthermore, Pt23 NCs exhibit a photothermal conversion efficiency of 68.4&#8201;% under 532&#8208;nm laser irradiation and can be used at least for six cycles, thus demonstrating great potential for practical applications.

         <title>Regulating Sulfur Redox Kinetics by Coupling Photocatalysis for High&#8208;Performance Photo&#8208;Assisted Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (PA&#8208;LSBs) exhibit outstanding performance through the selective catalysis mechanism of photocatalysis. The PHK composite cathode demonstrates exceptional solar energy conversion capabilities. PA&#8208;LSBs showcase excellent rate performance, long cycling stability, and high areal capacity, emphasizing their practical potential for energy storage applications in this advanced materials context.







Abstract
Challenges such as shuttle effect have hindered the commercialization of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs), despite their potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage devices. To address these issues, we explore the integration of solar energy into LSBs, creating a photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;sulfur battery (PA&#8208;LSB). The PA&#8208;LSB provides a novel and sustainable solution by coupling the photocatalytic effect to accelerate sulfur redox reactions. Herein, a perovskite quantum dot&#8208;loaded MOF material serves as a cathode for the PA&#8208;LSB, creating built&#8208;in electric fields at the micro&#8208;interface to extend the lifetime of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers. The band structure of the composite material aligns well with the electrochemical reaction potential of lithium&#8208;sulfur, enabling precise regulation of polysulfides in the cathode of the PA&#8208;LSB system. This is attributed to the selective catalysis of the liquid&#8208;solid reaction stage in the lithium&#8208;sulfur electrochemical process by photocatalysis. These contribute to the outstanding performance of PA&#8208;LSBs, particularly demonstrating a remarkably high reversible capacity of 679&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C, maintaining stable cycling for 1500&#8197;cycles with the capacity decay rate of 0.022&#8201;% per cycle. Additionally, the photo&#8208;charging capability of the PA&#8208;LSB holds the potential to compensate for non&#8208;electric energy losses during the energy storage process, contributing to the development of lossless energy storage devices.

         <title>Unveiling Crucial Chemical Processing Parameters Influencing the Performance of Solution&#8208;Processed Inorganic Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical changes occur throughout the entire process of producing thermoelectric materials from particles in solution. Especially during the purification steps, which consequently influences the materials composition, microstructure and ultimately results in variations in the transport properties. Understanding the chemistry that occurs is crucial for material optimization and reproducibility.







Abstract
Production of thermoelectric materials from solution&#8208;processed particles involves the synthesis of particles, their purification and densification into pelletized material. Chemical changes that occur during each one of these steps render them performance determining. Particularly the purification steps, bypassed in conventional solid&#8208;state synthesis, are the cause for large discrepancies among similar solution&#8208;processed materials. In present work, the investigation focuses on a water&#8208;based surfactant free solution synthesis of SnSe, a highly relevant thermoelectric material. We show and rationalize that the number of leaching steps, purification solvent, annealing, and annealing atmosphere have significant influence on the Sn&#8201;:&#8201;Se ratio and impurity content in the powder. Such compositional changes that are undetectable by conventional characterization techniques lead to distinct consolidated materials with different types and concentration of defects. Additionally, the profound effect on their transport properties is demonstrated. We emphasize that understanding the chemistry and identifying key chemical species and their role throughout the process is paramount for optimizing material performance. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate the necessity of comprehensive reporting of these steps as a standard practice to ensure material reproducibility.

         <title>Boost the Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence of Chiral Organometallic Platinum Complexes by Hierarchical Assembly into Fibrillar Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thin films of chiral Pt(II) complexes exhibit giantly&#8208;amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with |glum| of 0.53 at 560&#8197;nm and &#934; of ~50&#8201;% in air, as a result of the hierarchical formation of crystalline fibrillar networks upon spin coating. These films display promising potentials in CPL&#8208;contrast imaging and inducing circularly polarized light generation from achiral emitters and common LED lamps.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active molecular materials have drawn increasing attention due to their promising applications for next&#8208;generation display and optoelectronic technologies. Currently, it is challenging to obtain CPL materials with both large luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) and high quantum yield (&#934;). A pair of enantiomeric N&#8201;N&#8201;C&#8208;type Pt(II) complexes (L/D)&#8208;1 modified with chiral Leucine methyl ester are presented herein. Though the solutions of these complexes are CPL&#8208;inactive, the spin&#8208;coated thin films of (L/D)&#8208;1 exhibit giantly&#8208;amplified circularly polarized phosphorescences with |glum| of 0.53 at 560&#8197;nm and &#934;air of ~50&#8201;%, as well as appealing circular dichroism (CD) signals with the maximum absorption dissymmetry factor |gabs| of 0.37&#8211;0.43 at 480&#8197;nm. This superior CPL performance benefits from the hierarchical formation of crystalline fibrillar networks upon spin coating. Comparative studies of another pair of chiral Pt(II) complexes (L/D)&#8208;2 with a symmetric N&#8201;C&#8201;N coordination mode suggest that the asymmetric N&#8201;N&#8201;C coordination of (L/D)&#8208;1 are favorable for the efficient exciton delocalization to amplify the CPL performance. Optical applications of the thin films of (L/D)&#8208;1 in CPL&#8208;contrast imaging and inducing CP light generation from achiral emitters and common light&#8208;emitting diode lamps have been successfully realized.

         <dc:description>
Ethylenedioxythiophene was adopted to construct small molecular donor with multiple conformation locks, which can serve as efficient guest donor in ternary organic solar cells to provide cascade energy levels and two&#8208;dimensional charge transport channels, thus enabling high efficiency of 19.3&#8201;% compared to 18.2&#8201;% of the binary device.







Abstract
Ternary organic solar cells (T&#8208;OSCs) represent an efficient strategy for enhancing the performance of OSCs. Presently, the majority of high&#8208;performance T&#8208;OSCs incorporates well&#8208;established Y&#8208;acceptors or donor polymers as the third component. In this study, a novel class of conjugated small molecules has been introduced as the third component, demonstrating exceptional photovoltaic performance in T&#8208;OSCs. This innovative molecule comprises ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) bridge and 3&#8208;ethylrhodanine as the end group, with the EDOT unit facilitating the creation of multiple conformation locks. Consequently, the EDOT&#8208;based molecule exhibits two&#8208;dimensional charge transport, distinguishing it from the thiophene&#8208;bridged small molecule, which displays fewer conformation locks and provides one&#8208;dimensional charge transport. Furthermore, the robust electron&#8208;donating nature of EDOT imparts the small molecule with cascade energy levels relative to the electron donor and acceptor. As a result, OSCs incorporating the EDOT&#8208;based small molecule as the third component demonstrate enhanced mobilities, yielding a remarkable efficiency of 19.3&#8201;%, surpassing the efficiency of 18.7&#8201;% observed for OSCs incorporating thiophene&#8208;based small molecule as the third component. The investigations in this study underscore the excellence of EDOT as a building block for constructing conjugated materials with multiple conformation locks and high charge carrier mobilities, thereby contributing to elevated photovoltaic performance in OSCs.

&lt;p&gt;Ternary organic solar cells (T-OSCs) represent an efficient strategy for enhancing the performance of OSCs. Presently, the majority of high-performance T-OSCs incorporates well-established Y-acceptors or donor polymers as the third component. In this study, a novel class of conjugated small molecules has been introduced as the third component, demonstrating exceptional photovoltaic performance in T-OSCs.

         <title>Chemical Control of Fluorescence Lifetime towards Multiplexing Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the chemical control of fluorescence lifetimes of boron dipyrromethene derivatives through the photo&#8208;induced electron transfer process and the intramolecular charge transfer process. The resulting fluorophores were applied in fluorescence lifetime multiplexing imaging both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Fluorescence lifetime imaging has been a powerful tool for biomedical research. Recently, fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based multiplexing imaging has expanded imaging channels by using probes that harbor the same spectral channels and distinct excited state lifetime. While it is desirable to control the excited state lifetime of any given fluorescent probes, the rational control of fluorescence lifetimes remains a challenge. Herein, we chose boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) as a model system and provided chemical strategies to regulate the fluorescence lifetime of its derivatives with varying spectral features. We find electronegativity of structural substituents at the 8&#8242; and 5&#8242; positions is important to control the lifetime for the green&#8208;emitting and red&#8208;emitting BODIPY scaffolds. Mechanistically, such influences are exerted via the photo&#8208;induced electron transfer and the intramolecular charge transfer processes for the 8&#8242; and 5&#8242; positions of BODIPY, respectively. Based on these principles, we have generated a group of BODIPY probes that enable imaging experiments to separate multiple targets using fluorescence lifetime as a signal. In addition to BODIPY, we envision modulation of electronegativity of chemical substituents could serve as a feasible strategy to achieve rational control of fluorescence lifetime for a variety of small molecule fluorophores.

         <title>Activating and Stabilizing a Reversible four Electron Redox Reaction of I&#8722;/I+ for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Iodine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an efficient inter&#8208;halogen activation strategy together with an interlayer confinement design, which successfully triggers and stabilizes a highly reversible four&#8208;electron redox reaction from I&#8722; to I+ for Zn&#8208;Iodine batteries. As a result, the specific capacity, output voltage and cycling performance of zinc&#8208;iodide battery are greatly improved.







Abstract
Low capacity and poor cycle stability greatly inhibit the development of zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. Herein, a high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;iodine battery has been reached by designing and optimizing both electrode and electrolyte. The Br&#8722; is introduced as the activator to trigger I+, and coupled with I+ forming interhalogen to stabilize I+ to achieve a four&#8208;electron reaction, which greatly promotes the capacity. And the Ni&#8722;Fe&#8722;I LDH nanoflowers serve as the confinement host to enable the reactions of I&#8722;/I+ occurring in the layer due to the spacious and stable interlayer spacing of Ni&#8722;Fe&#8722;I LDH, which effectively suppresses the iodine&#8208;species shuttle ensuring high cycling stability. As a result, the electrochemical performance is greatly enhanced, especially in specific capacity (as high as 350&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 far higher than two&#8208;electron transfer Zn&#8208;iodine batteries) and cycling performance (94.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10000&#8197;cycles). This strategy provides a new way to realize high capacity and long&#8208;term stability of Zn&#8208;iodine batteries.

         <title>Small Ionic&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Based Molecule Drives Strong Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we develop a facile supramolecular modification strategy for the construction of ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule adhesives. A fundamental understanding of the mechanism underlying the high adhesion strength could serve as a guiding principle for the molecular design of novel adhesive materials. We anticipate that our work will facilitate the advancement and application of small&#8208;molecule adhesives in many burgeoning fields.







Abstract
Nature has inspired scientists to fabricate adhesive materials for applications in many burgeoning areas. However, it is still a significant challenge to develop small&#8208;molecule adhesives with high&#8208;strength, low&#8208;temperature and recyclable properties, although these merits are of great interest in various aspects. Herein, we report a series of strong adhesives based on low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight molecular solids driven by the terminal modification of ionic liquids (ILs) and subsequent supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. The emergence of high strength and liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transitions for these supramolecular aggregates relies on modifying IL with a high melting point motif and enriching the types of noncovalent interactions in the original ILs. Using this strategy, we demonstrate that our IL&#8208;based molecular solids can efficiently obtain a high adhesion strength (up to 8.95&#8197;MPa). Importantly, we elucidate the mechanism underlying the reversible and strong adhesion enabled by monomer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer transitions. These fundamental findings provide guidance for the design of high&#8208;performance supramolecular adhesive materials.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Radical Aromatic C&#8722;H Functionalization of Alloxazine and Flavin through Ground&#8208;State Single Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective functionalization of flavin analogues is desirable for property tuning but requires de novo synthesis. A synthetic strategy involving the introduction of a remote redox site followed by copper complexation turns an alloxazine and a flavin into redox&#8208;active structures and activates their aromatic ring for site&#8208;selective aromatic C&#8722;H functionalization. This unprecedented mechanism opens new vistas in the chemistry of flavins and analogues.







Abstract
Flavins and their alloxazine isomers are key chemical scaffolds for bioinspired electron transfer strategies. Their properties can be fine&#8208;tuned by functional groups, which must be introduced at an early stage of the synthesis as their aromatic ring is inert towards post&#8208;functionalization. We show that the introduction of a remote metal&#8208;binding redox site on alloxazine and flavin activates their aromatic ring towards direct C&#8722;H functionalization. Mechanistic studies are consistent with a synthetic sequence involving ground&#8208;state single electron transfer (SET) with an electrophilic source followed by radical&#8208;radical coupling. This unprecedented reactivity opens new opportunities in molecular editing of flavins by direct aromatic post&#8208;functionalization and the utility of the method is demonstrated with the site&#8208;selective C6 functionalization of alloxazine and flavin with a CF3 group, Br or Cl, that can be further elaborated into OH and aryl for chemical diversification.

         <title>Selective Arylation of RNA 2&#8242;&#8208;OH Groups via SNAr Reaction with Trialkylammonium Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocyclic trialkylammonium arylating agents are shown to react efficiently with RNA in water, placing aryl ethers at 2&#8242;&#8208;O positions in the biopolymer. The reagents, which are stable for weeks in water but react with RNA in minutes to hours, can be used to modify and label RNA, and to probe its structure.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule reactions at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups of RNA enable useful applications for transcriptome technology and biology. To date, all reactions have involved carbonyl acylation and mechanistically related sulfonylation, limiting the types of modifications and properties that can be achieved. Here we report that electron&#8208;deficient heteroaryl species selectively react with 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups of RNA in water via SNAr chemistry. In particular, trialkyl&#8208;ammonium (TAA)&#8208;activated aromatic heterocycles, prepared in one step from aryl chloride precursors, give high conversions to aryl ether adducts with RNAs in aqueous buffer in ~2&#8211;3&#8197;h. Remarkably, a TAA triazine previously used only for reaction with carboxylic acids, shows unprecedented selectivity for RNA over water, reacting rapidly with 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups while exhibiting a half&#8208;life in water of &gt;10&#8197;days. We further show that a triazine aryl species can be used as a probe at trace&#8208;level yields to map RNA structure in vitro. Finally, we prepare a number of functionalized trialkylammonium triazine reagents and show that they can be used to covalently label RNA efficiently for use in vitro and in living cells. This direct arylation chemistry offers a simple and distinct structural scaffold for post&#8208;synthetic RNA modification, with potential utility in multiple applications in transcriptome research.

         <title>N&#8208;(Sulfonio)Sulfilimine Reagents: Non&#8208;Oxidizing Sources of Electrophilic Nitrogen Atom for Skeletal Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under rhodium catalysis N&#8208;sulfonio(sulfilimines) act as sulfonitrene precursors. Reaction of such species with indenes presumably delivers N&#8208;sulfonio aziridines, which evolve to isoquinolines via electrocyclic ring expansion. Contrarily, 1&#8208;arycyclobutenes are transformed into 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;1&#8208;arylcyclopropanes via ring contraction.







Abstract
The one&#8208;pot synthesis of &#955;4&#8208;dibenzothiophen&#8208;5&#8208;imino&#8208;N&#8208;dibenzothiophenium triflate (1) in multigram scale is reported. This compound reacts with Rh2(esp)2 (esp=&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8242;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzenedipropionic acid) generating a Rh&#8208;coordinated sulfonitrene species, which is able to transfer the electrophilic nitrene moiety to olefins. When indenes are used as substrates, isoquinolines are obtained in good yields. We assumed that after formation of the corresponding N&#8208;sulfonio aziridine, a ring expansion occurs via selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage and concomitant elimination of dibenzothiophene. Unexpectedly, a similar protocol transforms 1&#8208;arylcyclobutenes into 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;1&#8208;arylcyclopropanes. Our calculations indicate that aziridination is not favored in this case; instead, sulfilimine&#8208;substituted cyclobutyl carbocations are initially formed, and these evolve to the isolated cyclopropanes via ring contraction. Both procedures are operationally simple, tolerate a range of functional groups, including oxidation&#8208;sensitive alcohols and aldehydes, and enable the convenient preparation of valuable 15N&#8208;labelled products. These results demonstrate the potential of 1 to provide alternative pathways for the selective transfer of N&#8208;atoms in organic molecules.

         <title>Mitigating Sodium Ordering for Enhanced Solid Solution Behavior in Layered NaNiO2 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective reduction of multiple phase transformations in NaNiO2 has been achieved through divalent Mg2+ doping, which deshields the electron density from Na+ ions. This outcome can be attributed to the more ionic nature of Mg&#8722;O bond, creating free space for the mobility of Na+ ions and mitigating the Na+ion ordering.







Abstract
The O&#8208;type layered nickel oxides suffer from undesired cooperative Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion stemming from Ni3+ ions and undergo multiple biphasic structural transformations during the insertion/extraction of large Na+ ions, posing a significant challenge to stabilize the structural integrity. We present here a systematic investigation of the impact of substituting 5&#8201;% divalent (Mg2+) or trivalent (Al3+ or Co3+) ions for Ni3+ to alleviate Na+ion ordering and perturb the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect to enhance structural stability. We gauge a fundamental understanding of the Mg&#8722;O and Na&#8722;O or Mg&#8722;O&#8722;Na bonding interactions, noting that the ionicity of the Mg&#8722;O bond deshields the electronic cloud of oxygen from Na+ ions. Furthermore, calculations of the Van Vleck distortion modes reveal a relaxation of NiO6 octahedra from Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and a reduced electron density at the interlayer with Mg2+ substitution. Long&#8208;range (operando
X&#8208;ray diffraction) and short&#8208;range (magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance) structural analyses provide insights into reduced ordering, allowing a stable continuous solid solution. Overall, Mg&#8208;substitution results in a high&#8208;capacity retention of ~96&#8201;% even after 100&#8197;cycles, showcasing the potential of this strategy for overcoming the structural instabilities and enhancing the performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Blue Long Afterglow and Ultra Broadband Vis&#8208;NIR Emission from All&#8208;Inorganic Copper&#8208;Doped Silver Halide Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of copper(I) ions into all&#8208;inorganic Rb2AgBr3 single crystals achieves ultralong blue afterglow (&gt;300&#8197;s) by manipulating the formation of bromine vacancies. Moreover, this doping strategy enables a cascade of energy transfer among distinct emission centers, resulting in near&#8208;unity&#8208;yield white light emission and extending the emission into the near&#8208;infrared region.







Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic metal halides with afterglow emission have attracted increasing attention due to their significantly longer afterglow duration and higher stability compared to their organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid counterparts. However, their afterglow colors have not yet reached the blue spectral region. Here, we report all&#8208;inorganic copper&#8208;doped Rb2AgBr3 single crystals with ultralong blue afterglow (&gt;300&#8197;s) by modulating defect states through doping engineering. The introduction of copper(I) ions into Rb2AgBr3 facilitates the formation of bromine vacancies, thus increasing the density of trap states available for charge storage and enabling bright, persistent emission after ceasing the excitation. Moreover, cascade energy transfer between distinct emissive centers in the crystals results in ultra&#8208;broadband photoluminescence, not only covering the whole white light with near&#8208;unity quantum yield but also extending into the near&#8208;infrared region. This &#8216;cocktail&#8217; of exotic light&#8208;emission properties, in conjunction with the excellent stability of copper&#8208;doped Rb2AgBr3 crystals, allowed us to demonstrate their implementation to solid&#8208;state lighting, night vision, and intelligent anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>A Dielectric MXene&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Built Electric Field in Polymer Electrolyte Triggering Fast Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport and High&#8208;Voltage Cycling Stability</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;built electric field strategy is proposed to enhance Li+ transportation and accelerate the degradation dynamics of LiTFSI by optimizing the termination of MXene, resulting in the formation of LiF&#8208;enriched SEI and CEI enhanced stable interfaces, as evidenced by XPS etching and ToF&#8208;SIMS. It showcases prolonged cycle life at a high voltage up to 4.6&#8197;V, showing promising applications for quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolytes.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (QPE) lithium (Li)&#8208;metal battery holds significant promise in the application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, yet it suffers from low ionic conductivity and poor oxidation stability. Herein, a novel self&#8208;built electric field (SBEF) strategy is proposed to enhance Li+ transportation and accelerate the degradation dynamics of carbon&#8208;fluorine bond cleavage in LiTFSI by optimizing the termination of MXene. Among them, the SBEF induced by dielectric Nb4C3F2 MXene effectively constructs highly conductive LiF&#8208;enriched SEI and CEI stable interfaces, moreover, enhances the electrochemical performance of the QPE. The related Li&#8208;ion transfer mechanism and dual&#8208;reinforced stable interface are thoroughly investigated using ab initio molecular dynamics, COMSOL, XPS depth profiling, and ToF&#8208;SIMS. This comprehensive approach results in a high conductivity of 1.34&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, leading to a small polarization of approximately 25&#8197;mV for Li//Li symmetric cell after 6000&#8197;h. Furthermore, it enables a prolonged cycle life at a high voltage of up to 4.6&#8197;V. Overall, this work not only broadens the application of MXene for QPE but also inspires the great potential of the self&#8208;built electric field in QPE&#8208;based high&#8208;voltage batteries.

         <title>Taylor Dispersion&#8208;Induced Phase Separation for the Efficient Characterisation of Protein Condensate Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein phase separation (PPS) is important in functional and disease biology but is challenging to study. We present Taylor dispersion induced phase separation (TDIPS) to study PPS in a reaction&#8208;diffusion system inside a microfluidic capillary. The resulting data is highly information&#8208;rich and allows for thermodynamic analysis but also efficient screening campaigns of phase separation&#8208;modulating compounds using only nanoliters of sample per data point.







Abstract
Biomolecular condensates have emerged as important structures in cellular function and disease, and are thought to form through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). Thorough and efficient in vitro experiments are therefore needed to elucidate the driving forces of protein LLPS and the possibility to modulate it with drugs. Here we present Taylor dispersion&#8208;induced phase separation (TDIPS), a method to robustly measure condensation phenomena using a commercially available microfluidic platform. It uses only nanoliters of sample, does not require extrinsic fluorescent labels, and is straightforward to implement. We demonstrate TDIPS by screening the phase behaviour of two proteins that form biomolecular condensates in vivo, PGL&#8208;3 and Ddx4. Uniquely accessible to this method, we find an unexpected re&#8208;entrant behaviour at very low ionic strength, where LLPS is inhibited for both proteins. TDIPS can also probe the reversibility of assemblies, which was shown for both &#945;&#8208;synuclein and for lysozyme, relevant for health and biotechnology, respectively. Finally, we highlight how effective inhibition concentrations and partitioning of LLPS&#8208;modifying compounds can be screened highly efficiently.

         <title>Alveoli&#8208;Inspired Carbon Cathodes with Interconnected Porous Structure and Asymmetric Coordinated Vanadium Sites for Superior Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alveoli&#8208;inspired carbon cathode with interconnected porous structure and asymmetric coordinated V&#8722;S1N3 sites has been proposed for efficient and stable Li&#8722;S batteries. The asymmetric electronic distribution and large atom radius of S resulted in the sloping adsorption for polysulfide and low thermodynamic energy barriers, which resulted in enhanced sulfur adsorption&#8208;catalytic conversion and stable long&#8208;cycle performance for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Accelerating sulfur conversion catalysis to alleviate the shuttle effect has become a novel paradigm for effective Li&#8722;S batteries. Although nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal single&#8208;atom (M&#8722;N4) catalysts have been investigated, further optimizing its utilization rate and catalytic activities is urgently needed for practical applications. Inspired by the natural alveoli tissue with interconnected structure and well&#8208;distributed enzyme catalytic sites on the wall for the simultaneously fast diffusion and in situ catalytic conversion of substrates, here, we proposed the controllable synthesis of bioinspired carbon cathode with interconnected porous structure and asymmetric coordinated V&#8722;S1N3 sites for efficient and stable Li&#8722;S batteries. The enzyme&#8208;mimetic V&#8722;S1N3 shows asymmetric electronic distribution and high tunability, therefore enhancing in situ polysulfide conversion activities. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the high charge asymmetry degree and large atom radius of S in V&#8722;S1N3 result in sloping adsorption for polysulfide, thereby exhibiting low thermodynamic energy barriers and long&#8208;range stability (0.076&#8201;% decay over 600&#8197;cycles).

         <title>SilE&#8208;R and SilE&#8208;S&#8212;DABB Proteins Catalying Enantiospecific Hydrolysis of Organosilyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
SilE&#8722;R and SilE&#8722;S, members of the DABB protein family, are the first two enzymes described that catalyse the enantiospecific hydrolysis of organosilyl ethers. They accept a wide range of substrates, including TBDMS&#8208;protected alcohols. The natural function of SilE&#8722;R and SilE&#8722;S is still unknown, but their discovery paves the way towards a green and selective transformation of organosilane organosilanol substrates.







Abstract
Silyl ethers fulfil a fundamental role in synthetic organic chemistry as protecting groups and their selective cleavage is an important factor in their application. We present here for the first time two enzymes, SilE&#8722;R and SilE&#8722;S, which are able to hydrolyse silyl ethers. They belong to the stress&#8208;response dimeric A/B barrel domain (DABB) family and are able to cleave the Si&#8722;O bond with opposite enantiopreference. Silyl ethers containing aromatic, cyclic or aliphatic alcohols and, depending on the alcohol moiety, silyl functions as large as TBDMS are accepted. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of SilE&#8722;R, determined to a resolution of 1.98&#8197;&#197;, in combination with mutational studies, revealed an active site featuring two histidine residues, H8 and H79, which likely act synergistically as nucleophile and Br&#248;nsted base in the hydrolytic mechanism, which has not previously been described for enzymes. Although the natural function of SilE&#8722;R and SilE&#8722;S is unknown, we propose that these &#8216;silyl etherases&#8217; may have significant potential for synthetic applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fluorinated Ethers to Mitigate Electrode Surface Reactivity in High&#8208;Voltage NCM811&#8208;Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a non&#8208;fluorinated ether&#8208;based electrolyte to prolong the lifespan of high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich ternary LMBs. The electrolyte simultaneously solves the challenges of both the high&#8208;voltage cathode and Li metal anode by mitigating the electrode surface reactivity. The problems of NiO rock&#8208;salt transition, intragranular crack/microstructural defect formation, gas releases, and over&#8208;growth SEI have been alleviated.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) with nickel (Ni)&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes exhibit twice the energy density of conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, their lifespan is limited by severe side reactions caused by high electrode reactivity. Fluorinated solvent&#8208;based electrolytes can address this challenge, but they pose environmental and biological hazards. This work reports on the molecular engineering of fluorine (F)&#8208;free ethers to mitigate electrode surface reactivity in high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich LMBs. By merely extending the alkyl chains of traditional ethers, we effectively reduce the catalytic reactivity of the cathode towards the electrolyte at high voltages, which suppresses the oxidation decomposition of the electrolyte, microstructural defects and rock&#8208;salt phase formation in the cathode, and gas release issues. The high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich NCM811&#8208;Li battery delivers capacity retention of 80&#8201;% after 250&#8197;cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.85&#8201;%, even superior to that in carbonate electrolytes. Additionally, this strategy facilitates passivation of the Li anode by forming a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, boosting the Li reversibility to 99.11&#8201;% with a cycling life of 350&#8197;cycles, which outperforms conventional F&#8208;free ether electrolytes. Consequently, the lifespan of practical LMBs has been prolonged by over 100&#8201;% and 500&#8201;% compared to those in conventional carbonate&#8208; and ether&#8208;based electrolytes, respectively.

         <title>Probing Energy&#8208;Funneling Kinetics in Nanocrystal Sublattices for Superior X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>

Energy&#8208;funneling kinetics in NaLuF4: Mn2+/Gd3+ nanocrystals were explored through precise microenvironment engineering within nanocrystal sublattices. The resulting tailorable radioluminescence afterglow enabled high&#8208;sensitivity, high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with an ultralong optical memory.







Abstract
Long&#8208;lasting radioluminescence scintillators have recently attracted substantial attention from both research and industrial communities, primarily due to their distinctive capabilities of converting and storing X&#8208;ray energy. However, determination of energy&#8208;conversion kinetics in these nanocrystals remains unexplored. Here we present a strategy to probe and unveil energy&#8208;funneling kinetics in NaLuF4:Mn2+/Gd3+ nanocrystal sublattices through Gd3+&#8208;driven microenvironment engineering and Mn2+&#8208;mediated radioluminescence profiling. Our photophysical studies reveal effective control of energy&#8208;funneling kinetics and demonstrate the tunability of electron trap depth ranging from 0.66 to 0.96&#8197;eV, with the corresponding trap density varying between 2.38&#215;105 and 1.34&#215;107&#8197;cm&#8722;3. This enables controlled release of captured electrons over durations spanning from seconds to 30&#8197;days. It allows tailorable emission wavelength within the range of 520&#8211;580&#8197;nm and fine&#8208;tuning of thermally&#8208;stimulated temperature between 313&#8211;403&#8197;K. We further utilize these scintillators to fabricate high&#8208;density, large&#8208;area scintillation screens that exhibit a 6&#8208;fold improvement in X&#8208;ray sensitivity, 22 lp/mm high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging, and a 30&#8208;day&#8208;long optical memory. This enables high&#8208;contrast imaging of injured mice through fast thermally&#8208;stimulated radioluminescence readout. These findings offer new insights into the correlation of radioluminescence dynamics with energy&#8208;funneling kinetics, thereby contributing to the advancement of high&#8208;energy nanophotonic applications.

         <title>3D Printing of Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Systems with Linear and Bottlebrush Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyelectrolyte complex, comprising anionic bottlebrush polymer and cationic linear polymer, exhibits a broader phase separation diagram and higher salt resistance capacity and vary spherical&#8208;like to core&#8211;shell&#8208;like conformation. Utilizing this system creates a tubular&#8208;like flow structure at the interface of two aqueous liquids, enhancing the structural stability, offering a more efficient and easy method for particle transport.







Abstract
We formed core&#8211;shell&#8208;like polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) from an anionic bottlebrush polymer with poly (acrylic acid) side chains with a cationic linear poly (allylamine hydrochloride). By varying the pH, the number of side chains of the polyanionic BB polymers (Nbb), the charge density of the polyelectrolytes, and the salt concentration, the phase separation behavior and salt resistance of the complexes could be tuned by the conformation of the BBs. By combining the linear/bottlebrush polyelectrolyte complexation with all&#8208;liquid 3D printing, flow&#8208;through tubular constructs were produced that showed selective transport across the PEC membrane comprising the walls of the tubules. These tubular constructs afford a new platform for flow&#8208;through delivery systems.

         <title>Molecular Engineering for Modulating Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution of Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fully conjugated 3D covalent organic frameworks were synthesized by using the molecular engineering strategy. The influences of key factors including the D&#8208;A structure, hydrophilicity, porosity, as well as the conjugated/non&#8208;conjugated structures on their photocatalytic hydrogen evolution properties were discussed. The as&#8208;synthesized fully conjugated 3D COFs could generate H2 up to 40.36&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently shown great potential for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Currently almost all reports are focused on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs, while the 3D counterparts are rarely explored due to their non&#8208;conjugated frameworks derived from the sp3 carbon based tetrahedral building blocks. Here, we rationally designed and synthesized a series of fully conjugated 3D COFs by using the saddle&#8208;shaped cyclooctatetrathiophene derivative as the building block. Through molecular engineering strategies, we thoroughly discussed the influences of key factors including the donor&#8208;acceptor structure, hydrophilicity, specific surface areas, as well as the conjugated/non&#8208;conjugated structures on their photocatalytic hydrogen evolution properties. The as&#8208;synthesized fully conjugated 3D COFs could generate the hydrogen up to 40.36&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1. This is the first report on intrinsic metal&#8208;free 3D COFs in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution application. Our work provides insight on the structure design of 3D COFs for highly&#8208;efficient photocatalysis, and also reveals that the semiconducting fully conjugated 3D COFs could be a useful platform in clear energy&#8208;related fields.

The dx2&#8722;y2 electronic state within antibonding bands plays a decisive role in the Ni(OH)2&#8208;based methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The onset potential depends on the deprotonation ability (Ni2+ to Ni3+), which was closely related to the band center of dx2&#8722;y2 orbital. The closer of dx2&#8722;y2 orbital to the Fermi level showed the stronger the deprotonation ability. Meanwhile, in the high potential region, the broadening of dx2&#8722;y2 orbital would facilitate the electron transfer from methanol to catalysts (Ni3+ to Ni2+), further enhancing the catalytic properties. This work provides a new design paradigm for developing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;efficiency Ni(OH)2&#8208;based catalysts for MOR.







Abstract
The anodic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) plays a crucial role in coupling with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and enables the sustainable production of the high&#8208;valued formate. Nickel&#8208;based hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) as MOR electrocatalyst has attracted enormous attention. However, the key factor determining the intrinsic catalytic activity remains unknown, which significantly hinders the further development of Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst. Here, we found that the

         <title>Catalytic Kinetic Resolution of Monohydrosilanes via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic kinetic resolution strategy was developed for the access of chiral Si&#8208;stereogenic silanes. By employing Rh&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation, both dihydrobenzosilole&#8208;based organosilanes and monohydrosilane containing ortho&#8208;vinyl group could be prepared with high efficiency and good to excellent selectivity factors in one single operation.







Abstract
The catalytic access of silicon&#8208;stereogenic organosilanes remains a big challenge, and largely depends on the desymmetrization of the symmetric precursors with two identical substitutes attached to silicon atom. Here we report the construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic organosilanes via catalytic kinetic resolution of racemic monohydrosilanes with good to excellent selectivity factors. Both Si&#8208;stereogenic dihydrobenzosiloles and Si&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes could be efficiently accessed in one single operation via Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective intramolecular hydrosilylation, employing (R,R)&#8208;Et&#8208;DuPhos as the optimal ligand. This catalytic protocol features mild conditions, a low catalyst loading (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% [Rh(cod)Cl]2), high stereoinduction (S factor up to 152), and excellent scalability. Moreover, further derivatizations led to the efficient synthesis of uncommon middle&#8208;size (7&#8208; and 8&#8208;membered) Si&#8208;stereogenic silacycles. Preliminary mechanistic study indicates this reaction might undergo a modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod mechanism.

         <title>An Indocyanine Green&#8208;Based Nanoprobe for In Vivo Detection of Cellular Senescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sound of Senescence: A nanostructured organic probe, NanoJaggs, can be used as photoacoustic contrast agent for in vivo imaging of the senescent cell burden in post&#8208;chemotherapy tumors. Made of indocyanine green (ICG) dimers, 30&#8197;nm nanoparticles exploit an active endocytosis mechanism and increase the number of lysosomes to specifically light up senescent cells implicated in cancer initiation and progression.







Abstract
There is an urgent need to improve conventional cancer&#8208;treatments by preventing detrimental side effects, cancer recurrence and metastases. Recent studies have shown that presence of senescent cells in tissues treated with chemo&#8208; or radiotherapy can be used to predict the effectiveness of cancer treatment. However, although the accumulation of senescent cells is one of the hallmarks of cancer, surprisingly little progress has been made in development of strategies for their detection in vivo. To address a lack of detection tools, we developed a biocompatible, injectable organic nanoprobe (NanoJagg), which is selectively taken up by senescent cells and accumulates in the lysosomes. The NanoJagg probe is obtained by self&#8208;assembly of indocyanine green (ICG) dimers using a scalable manufacturing process and characterized by a unique spectral signature suitable for both photoacoustic tomography (PAT) and fluorescence imaging. In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies all indicate that NanoJaggs are a clinically translatable probe for detection of senescence and their PAT signal makes them suitable for longitudinal monitoring of the senescence burden in solid tumors after chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

         <title>Easy Synthetic Access to High&#8208;Melting Sulfurated Copolymers and their Self&#8208;Assembling Diblock Copolymers from Phenylisothiocyanate and Oxetane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of phenylisothiocyanate and oxetane yields sulfurated polymers with melting points of up to 181&#8201;&#176;C. Kinetic linkage control and minimal substitution are crucial to maximizing melting temperatures. Their controlled synthesis and tolerance to macro&#8208;chain transfer agents provide access to amphiphiles that can be used in crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, forming cylindrical micelles.







Abstract
Although sulfurated polymers promise unique properties, their controlled synthesis, particularly when it comes to complex and functional architectures, remains challenging. Here, we show that the copolymerization of oxetane and phenyl isothiocyanate selectively yields polythioimidocarbonates as a new class of sulfur containing polymers, with narrow molecular weight distributions (Mn=5&#8211;80&#8197;kg/mol with &#272;&#8804;1.2; Mn,max=124&#8197;kg/mol) and high melting points of up to 181&#8201;&#176;C. The method tolerates different substituent patterns on both the oxetane and the isothiocyanate. Self&#8208;nucleation experiments reveal that &#960;&#8208;stacking of phenyl substituents, the presence of unsubstituted polymer backbones, and the kinetically controlled linkage selectivity are key factors in maximising melting points. The increased tolerance to macro&#8208;chain transfer agents and the controlled propagation allows the synthesis of double crystalline and amphiphilic diblock copolymers, which can be assembled into micellar&#8208; and worm&#8208;like structures with amorphous cores in water. In contrast, crystallization driven self&#8208;assembly in ethanol gives cylindrical micelles or platelets.

Ultrathin amorphous/intermetallic heterophase PtPbBi NSs were synthesized for the first time, which exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance in HER and AORs owing to their unique heterointerfaces and abundant exposed active sites. Construction of amorphous/crystalline heterophase structures with multimetallic composition can effectively optimize the Gibbs free energy and enhance the electron transfer from the surface of the catalyst to *CH2OH.







Abstract
Constructing amorphous/intermetallic (A/IMC) heterophase structures by breaking the highly ordered IMC phase with disordered amorphous phase is an effective way to improve the electrocatalytic performance of noble metal&#8208;based IMC electrocatalysts because of the optimized electronic structure and abundant heterophase boundaries as active sites. In this study, we report the synthesis of ultrathin A/IMC PtPbBi nanosheets (NSs) for boosting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and alcohol oxidation reactions. The resulting A/IMC PtPbBi NSs exhibit a remarkably low overpotential of only 25&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the HER in an acidic electrolyte, together with outstanding stability for 100&#8197;h. In addition, the PtPbBi NSs show high mass activities for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), which are 13.2 and 14.5 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of amorphous/intermetallic components and multimetallic composition facilitate the electron transfer from the catalyst to key intermediates, thus improving the catalytic activity of MOR. This work establishes a novel pathway for the synthesis of heterophase two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials with high electrocatalytic performance across a wide range of electrochemical applications.

         <title>Similarities and Differences in Benzene Reduction with Ca, Sr, Yb and Sm: Strong Evidence for Tetra&#8208;Anionic Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse sandwich benzene complexes are prone to metal oxidation state ambiguities. Based on comparisons between alkaline&#8208;earth and lanthanide metals, we provide strong evidence for the formal formation of a SmIII&#8208;benzene4&#8722;&#8208;SmIII complex.







Abstract
Inverse sandwich complexes of Yb and Sm stabilized by a bulky &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) ligand have been prepared: (BDI)Ln(&#951;6,&#951;6&#8208;C6H6)Ln(BDI); Ln=lanthanide. Coordinated benzene ligands can be neutral, di&#8208;anionic or, often controversially discussed, even tetra&#8208;anionic. The formal charge on benzene is correlated to assignment of the metal oxidation state which generally poses a problem. Herein, we take advantage of the structural similarities found when comparing CaII with YbII, and SrII with SmII complexes. In this work, we found an excellent overlap of the Ca/Yb inverse sandwich structures but a striking difference for the Sr/Sm pair. The much shorter Sm&#8722;N and Sm&#8208;C6H6 distances are strong evidence for a SmIII&#8208;benzene&#8722;4&#8208;SmIII assignment. This was further supported by NMR spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility, reactivity and comprehensive computational investigation.

         <title>Conjugation and Topology Engineering of 2D &#960;&#8208;d Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Robust Potassium Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the first case of the application of conjugation and topology engineering to regulate the cation/anion storage feature of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with the rhombus/kagome structure as well as three/four&#8208;arm core, which presents robust framework structure and successive storage of cations/anions, thus showing the impressively electrochemical properties in potassium&#8208;ion half/full cells.







Abstract
The evolution of two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) provides a significant prospect for researching the next generation of green and advanced energy storage systems (ESSs). Especially, conjugation and topology engineering serve as an irreplaceable character in adjusting the electrochemical properties of ESSs. Herein, we proposed a novel strategy using conjugation and topology engineering to demonstrate the application of 2D c&#8208;MOFs in robust potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) for the first time. By comparing 2D c&#8208;MOFs with the rhombus/kagome structure as well as three/four&#8208;arm core, the rhombus structure (sql&#8208;Cu&#8208;TBA&#8208;MOF) cathode for PIBs can display the impressive electrochemical performance, including a high specific discharge capacity of 178.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a well long&#8208;term cycle stability of more than 9,000 (at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Moreover, full PIBs (FPIBs) are constructed by pairing sql&#8208;Cu&#8208;TBA&#8208;MOF cathode with dipotassium terephthalate (KTP) anode, which delivers a high reversible discharge specific capacity of 146.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and great practical application prospect. These findings provide reasonable implications for the design of 2D c&#8208;MOFs from the perspective of conjugation and topology engineering for advanced energy storage systems.

         <title>Commercializable Naphthalene Diimide Anolytes for Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposed the hydrothermal synthesis methodology for the preparation of high&#8208;performance naphthalene diimide materials on a hundred&#8208;gram scale, and showed great commercial potential offering cost&#8208;effective production. Under the synergistic effects of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and H&#8208;bonding networks, naphthalene diimide delivered excellent battery performance including high capacity/power, and long lifetime.







Abstract
Neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) hold the potential to facilitate the transition of renewable energy sources from auxiliary to primary energy, the commercial production of anolyte materials still suffers from insufficient performance of high&#8208;concentration and the high cost of the preparation problem. To overcome these challenges, this study provides a hydrothermal synthesis methodology and introduces the charged functional groups into hydrophobic naphthalene diimide cores, and prepares a series of high&#8208;performance naphthalene diimide anolytes. Under the synergistic effect of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and H&#8208;bonding networks, the naphthalene diimide exhibits excellent structural stability and the highest water solubility (1.85&#8197;M for dex&#8208;NDI) reported to date. By employing the hydrothermal method, low&#8208;cost naphthalene diimides are successfully synthesized on a hundred&#8208;gram scale of $0.16&#8197;g&#8722;1 ($2.43&#8197;Ah&#8722;1), which is also the lowest price reported to date. The constructed full battery achieves a high electron concentration of 2.4&#8197;M, a high capacity of 54.4&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1, and a power density of 318&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with no significant capacity decay observed during long&#8208;duration cycling. These findings provide crucial support for the commercialization of AORFBs and pave the way for revolutionary developments in neutral AORFBs.

         <title>Unified Approach to Deamination and Deoxygenation Through Isonitrile Hydrodecyanation: A Combined Experimental and Computational Investigation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>

We report a general hydrodefunctionalization protocol using isonitrile intermediates. Employing photoredox catalysis, a nucleophilic boryl radical mediates the scission of a relatively inert C&#8722;NC bond, accomplishing deletion of the isonitrile group. This strategy applies to the hydrodefunctionalization of both amine and alcohol&#8208;containing compounds and extends to the reduction of carbonyls, olefins, and alkyl nitriles.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a general hydrodefunctionalization protocol of alcohols and amines through a common isonitrile intermediate. To cleave the relatively inert C&#8722;NC bond, we leveraged dual hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and photoredox catalysis to generate a nucleophilic boryl radical, which readily forms an imidoyl radical intermediate from the isonitrile.

&lt;p&gt;We report a general hydrodefunctionalization protocol using isonitrile intermediates. Employing photoredox catalysis, a nucleophilic boryl radical mediates the scission of a relatively inert C&#8722;NC bond, accomplishing deletion of the isonitrile group. This strategy applies to the hydrodefunctionalization of both amine and alcohol-containing compounds and extends to the reduction of carbonyls, olefins, and alkyl nitriles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we describe a general hydrodefunctionalization protocol of alcohols and amines through a common isonitrile intermediate. To cleave the relatively inert C&#8722;NC bond, we leveraged dual hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and photoredox catalysis to generate a nucleophilic boryl radical, which readily forms an imidoyl radical intermediate from the isonitrile. Rapid &#946;-scission then accomplishes defunctionalization. This method has been applied to the hydrodefunctionalization of both amine and alcohol-containing pharmaceuticals, natural products, and biomolecules. We extended this approach to the reduction of carbonyls and olefins to their saturated counterparts, as well as the hydrodecyanation of alkyl nitriles. Both experimental and computational studies demonstrate a facile &#946;-scission of the imidoyl radical, and reconcile differences in reactivity between nitriles and isonitriles within our protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>PolyBorylated Alkenes as Energy&#8208;Transfer Reactive Groups: Access to Multi&#8208;Borylated Cyclobutanes Combined with Hydrogen Atom Transfer Event</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of polyborylated cyclobutanes by photochemical [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition is reported. The reaction is enabled by triplet energy transfer to the polyborylated alkenes and operates with a wide array of polyborylated alkenes, and olefins, allowing for the creation of polyborylated&#8208;biradical intermediates. A side&#8208;product resulting from a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) via a photo&#8208;ene&#8208;type reaction was also obtained.







Abstract
While polyborylated alkenes are being recognized for their elevated status as highly valuable reagents in modern organic synthesis, allowing efficient access to a diverse array of transformations, including the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds, their potential as energy&#8208;transfer reactive groups has remained unexplored. Yet, this potential holds the key to generating elusive polyborylated biradical species, which can be captured by olefins, thereby leading to the construction of new highly&#8208;borylated scaffolds. Herein, we report a designed energy&#8208;transfer strategy for photosensitized [2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of poly&#8208;borylated alkenes with various olefins enabling the regioselective synthesis of diverse poly&#8208;borylated cyclobutane motifs, including the 1,1&#8208;di&#8208;, 1,1,2&#8208;tri&#8208;, and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetra&#8208;borylated cyclobutanes. In fact, these compounds belong to a family that presently lacks efficient synthetic pathways. Interestingly, when &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene was used, the reaction involves an interesting 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Mechanistic deuterium&#8208;labeling studies have provided insight into the outcome of 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer process. In addition, the polyborylated cyclobutanes are then demonstrated to be useful in selective oxidation processes resulting in the formation of cyclobutanones and &#947;&#8208;lactones.

         <title>Reversal of the Regioselectivity of Iron&#8208;Promoted Hydrogenation and Hydrohalogenation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We described an unprecedented iron&#8208;promoted hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) to gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes in reversed regioselectivity for the generation of difluoroalkyl radicals. Hydrogenation and halogenation of the in situ generated radicals gave difluoromethylated, chlorodifluoromethylated, bromodifluoromethylate and iododifluoromethylated products respectively. Mechanism experiments and theoretical studies revealed that the kinetic effect of the irreversible HAT process resulted in the reversal of the regioselectivity.







Abstract
The reaction regioselectivity of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes is dependent on the intrinsic polarity. Thus, the reversal of the regioselectivity of the addition reaction of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we described an unprecedented reversal of regioselectivity of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) to gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes triggered by Fe&#8722;H species for the formation of difluoroalkyl radicals. Hydrogenation of the in situ generated radicals gave difluoromethylated products. Mechanism experiments and theoretical studies revealed that the kinetic effect of the irreversible HAT process resulted in the reversal of the regioselectivity of this scenario, leading to the formation of a less stable &#945;&#8208;difluoroalkyl radical regioisomer. On basis of this new reaction of gem&#8208;difluoroalkene, the iron&#8208;promoted hydrohalogenation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes for the efficient synthesis of aliphatic chlorodifluoromethyl&#8208;, bromodifluoromethyl&#8208; and iododifluoromethyl&#8208;containing compounds was developed. Particularly, this novel hydrohalogenation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes provided an effect and large&#8208;scale access to various iododifluoromethylated compounds of high value for synthetic application.

         <title>A Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide with Ultrahigh Porosity for High&#8208;temperature and High&#8208;humidity Alkyne/Alkene Separation</title>

A new zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on phosphomolybdate is synthesized. The micropore of material is readily opened, which is suitable for adsorption of small molecules. The material shows high separation performance of alkyne and alkene particularly under high temperature and humidity conditions.







Abstract
Zeolitic octahedral metal oxide is a newly synthesized all&#8208;inorganic zeolitic material and has been used for adsorption, separation, and catalysis. Herein, a new zeolitic octahedral metal oxide was synthesized and characterized. The porous framework was established through the assembly of [P2Mo13O50] clusters with PO4 linkers. Guest molecules occupied the framework, which could be removed through heat treatment, thereby opening the micropores. The pore characteristics were controlled by the cations within the micropore, enabling the adjustment of the interactions with alkynes and alkenes. This resulted in good separation performance of ethylene/acetylene and propylene/propyne even under high temperature and humidity conditions. The high stability of the material enabled the efficient recovery and reuse without discernible loss in the separation performance. Due to the relatively weak interaction between the adsorbed alkyne and the framework, the adsorbent facilitated the recovery of a highly pure alkyne. This feature enhances the practical applicability of the material in various industrial processes.

         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;containing polymers with high melting points can be easily obtained from the copolymerization of phenylisothiocyanate and oxetane, as reported by Alex&#8197;J. Plajer et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202405047). The resulting polythioimidocarbonate can then serve as the core&#8208;forming block in the crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a diblock copolymer, accessed employing a macro&#8208;chain transfer agent strategy.

The largest organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;protected Pt nanoclusters with atomic precision were reported by Lingwen Liao, Jun Yang, and Zhikun Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402565). The as&#8208;obtained Pt23 nanoclusters via a mixture ligand protecting strategy exhibit superior catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction under acidic conditions compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts, without requiring calcination or other treatments. An excellent photothermal conversion efficiency was also revealed, indicating great potential for applications of such materials.

The energy density of aqueous zinc ion batteries is greatly affected by the low energy density, low potential and low power density of the cathode material. In their Research Article (e202403187), Xijin Xu, Huiqiao Li et&#8197;al. report a method to activate and stabilize a highly reversible four&#8208;electron redox reaction between I&#8722; and I+ by introducing Br&#8722; as a mediator, which greatly promotes the capacity and effectively suppresses iodine shuttling for high cycling stability.

A hydrothermal method was developed to synthesize naphthalene diimide anolytes for neutral flow batteries, significantly enhancing their solubility and stability. This cost&#8208;effective approach not only achieves higher capacity and power density but also promotes the commercialization of advanced energy storage technologies by offering a competitive edge over traditional methods, as reported by Gang He et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202405427).

         <title>Detergent Chemistry Modulates the Transgression of Planetary Boundaries including Antimicrobial Resistance and Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>

It's detergent o'clock and the role of detergent chemistry in transgressing Earth's resources is reviewed to support future research that secures safe operating spaces that humanity needs for its survival.







Abstract
Detergent chemistry enables applications in the world today while harming safe operating spaces that humanity needs for survival. Aim of this review is to support a holistic thought process in the design of detergent chemistry. We harness the planetary boundary concept as a framework for literature survey to identify progresses and knowledge gaps in context with detergent chemistry and five planetary boundaries that are currently transgressed, i.e., climate, freshwater, land system, novel entities, biosphere integrity. Our survey unveils the status of three critical challenges to be addressed in the years to come, including (i) the implementation of a holistically, climate&#8208;friendly detergent industry; (ii) the alignment of materialistic and social aspects in creating technical solutions by means of sustainable chemistry; (iii) the development of detergents that serve the purpose of applications but do not harm the biosphere in their role as novel entities. Specifically, medically relevant case reports revealed that even the most sophisticated detergent design cannot sufficiently accelerate drug discovery to outperform the antibiotic resistance development that detergents simultaneously promote as novel entities. Safe operating spaces that humanity needs for its survival may be secured by directing future efforts beyond sustainable chemistry, resource efficiency, and net zero emission targets.

Our survey unveils the status of three critical challenges to be addressed in the years to come, including (i) the implementation of a holistically, climate-friendly detergent industry; (ii) the alignment of materialistic and social aspects in creating technical solutions by means of sustainable chemistry; (iii) the development of detergents that serve the purpose of applications but do not harm the biosphere in their role as novel entities. Specifically, medically relevant case reports revealed that even the most sophisticated detergent design cannot sufficiently accelerate drug discovery to outperform the antibiotic resistance development that detergents simultaneously promote as novel entities. Safe operating spaces that humanity needs for its survival may be secured by directing future efforts beyond sustainable chemistry, resource efficiency, and net zero emission targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In situ/Operando Synchrotron Radiation Analytical Techniques for CO2/CO Reduction Reaction: From Atomic Scales to Mesoscales</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically introduces the cross&#8208;scale applications of synchrotron radiation technologies classified by radiation sources with varying wavelengths in CO(2)RR, covering electronic structure, atomic configuration, molecular adsorption, crystal structure, and devices, spanning from atomic scales to mesoscopic scales.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CO(2)RR) has emerged as a prospective and appealing strategy to realize carbon neutrality for manufacturing sustainable chemical products. Developing highly active electrocatalysts and stable devices has been demonstrated as effective approach to enhance the conversion efficiency of CO(2)RR. In order to rationally design electrocatalysts and devices, a comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic structure evolution within catalysts and micro&#8208;environment change around electrode interface, particularly under operation conditions, is indispensable. Synchrotron radiation has been recognized as a versatile characterization platform, garnering widespread attention owing to its high brightness, elevated flux, excellent directivity, strong polarization and exceptional stability. This review systematically introduces the applications of synchrotron radiation technologies classified by radiation sources with varying wavelengths in CO(2)RR. By virtue of in situ/operando synchrotron radiationanalytical techniques, we also summarize relevant dynamic evolution processes from electronic structure, atomic configuration, molecular adsorption, crystal lattice and devices, spanning scales from the angstrom to the micrometer. The merits and limitations of diverse synchrotron characterization techniques are summarized, and their applicable scenarios in CO(2)RR are further presented. On the basis of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fourth&#8208;generation synchrotron facilities, a perspective for further deeper understanding of the CO(2)RR process using synchrotron radiation analytical techniques is proposed.

         <title>Recent Advances and Opportunities in Reactivating Inactive Lithium in Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of inactive lithium is one of the main culprits of lithium metal battery failures. In this Minireview, the first of this kind, we summarized the formation of inactive lithium and reassessed its impact on battery performance metrics, discussed the cutting&#8208;edge of various strategies that have been devised to rejuvenate inactive lithium. By concluding existing strategies, we raised some unsolved questions and highlighted opportunities regarding inactive lithium and essential factors for reactivation strategies.







Abstract
The loss of active materials is one of the main culprits of the battery failures. As a typical example, the presence of inactive lithium, also known as &#8220;dead lithium&#8221;, contributes to the rapid capacity deterioration and reduces energy output in lithium batteries. This phenomenon has long been recognized as irreversible. In this Minireview, the first of this kind, we aim to summarize the formation of inactive lithium and reassess its impact on battery performance metrics. Additionally, we explore various strategies that have been devised to rejuvenate inactive lithium. This comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in reactivating inactive lithium not only offers insights into restoring capacity and enhancing battery performance metrics but also provides a foundation for future research in reviving other inactive materials found in next&#8208;generation batteries, such as lithium metal batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, other alkali metal batteries, and liquid flow batteries.

         <title>Molecular Symmetry and Art: Visualizing the Near&#8208;Symmetry of Molecules in Piet Mondrian's De Stijl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can we use asymmetric art to show symmetry? A new plot style, the Mondrian graph, is proposed as a method of displaying the concerted distortions of molecules, highlighting symmetry and the contribution of normal modes to solid&#8208;state conformation. The method of display borrows its artistic stylings from the works of Piet Mondrian&#8212;and speaks to how artistic and scientific conceptions of symmetry can be brought together.







Abstract
Symmetry and shape are essential aspects of molecular structure and how we interpret molecules and their properties. We, as chemists, are comfortable with pictorial representations of structure, in which some nuance is lost&#8212;investigating molecular shape numerically by looking at how closely it fits a reference, such as a plane, or a set of vectors or coordinates, is informative, though far from engaging. Often relationships between chemical structure and derived values are obscured. Taking our inspiration from Piet Mondrian's Compositions, we have depicted the symmetry information encoded within 3D data as blocks of color, to show clearly how chemical arguments and resultant molecular distortion may contribute to symmetry. Great art gives us a new perspective on the world; as a pastiche, this art may allow us to look at familiar molecules, such as porphyrins, in a new light, understanding how their shape and properties are intertwined.

         <title>Regiodivergent Hydrosilylation of Polar Enynes to Synthesize Site&#8208;Specific Silyl&#8208;Substituted Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, regiodivergent hydrosilylation reactions of enynoates were developed using platinum and ruthenium catalysts. Through meticulous substrate and catalyst design, high yields and stereoselectivities were achieved in obtaining silyl&#8208;substituted dienoates at various positions. Detailed DFT calculations identified the key factors governing regiocontrol in all three instances, which were consistent with experimental findings.







Abstract
Herein, we present catalyst&#8208;regulated switchable site&#8208;selective hydrosilylation of enynes, which are suitable for a wide range of alkyl and aryl substituted polar enynes and exhibit excellent functional group compatibility. Under the optimized conditions, silyl groups can be precisely installed at various positions of 1,3&#8208;dienes. While &#945;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;silylation products were obtained under platinum&#8208;catalytic systems, &#946;&#8208;silylation products were delivered with [Cp*RuCl]4 as catalyst. This process lead to the formation of 1,3&#8208;dienoates with diverse substitutions, which would pose challenges with other methodologies.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Arylation Polymerization at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an ambient&#8208;temperature ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylative polymerization. The present polymerization can produce various meta&#8208; and para&#8208;linked polymers with high molecular weights. Notably, the mild reaction conditions are beneficial in terms of chemoselectivity. Our strategy thus opens a new avenue for sustainable and highly selective polymerizations.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation polymerization (CHAP) is an attractive tool for constructing &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers in a sustainable manner. However, the existing methods primarily rely on palladium catalysis, which usually entails harsh reaction conditions and branching/cross&#8208;linking. Here we report the first example of an ambient&#8208;temperature ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation polymerization induced by visible light irradiation. The present polymerization can produce various meta&#8208; and para&#8208;linked polymers in excellent yields with high molecular weights. The remarkable feature of our mild reaction platform is represented by high chemoselectivity, leading to polymers that are otherwise inaccessible under conventional reaction conditions at high temperatures.

The present polymerization can produce various &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-linked polymers in excellent yields with high molecular weights. The remarkable feature of our mild reaction platform is represented by high chemoselectivity, leading to polymers that are otherwise inaccessible under conventional reaction conditions at high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Asymmetric Radical Functionalization of Aldehydes Enabled by a Redox Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminocatalysis and electrochemistry cooperate, enabling SOMO&#8208;type transformations for asymmetric electrochemical synthesis. Electricity drives enantioselective radical processes via oxidation of catalytically generated enamines. Key is the use of a biphenyl redox shuttle to prevent catalyst degradation, yielding desired compounds with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Aminocatalysis is a well&#8208;established tool that enables the production of enantioenriched compounds under mild conditions. Its versatility is underscored by its seamless integration with various synthetic approaches. While the combination of aminocatalysis with metal catalysis, photochemistry, and stoichiometric oxidants has been extensively explored, its synergy with electrochemical activation remains largely unexplored. Herein, we present the successful merger of electrochemistry and aminocatalysis to perform SOMO&#8208;type transformations, expanding the toolkit for asymmetric electrochemical synthesis. The methodology harnesses electricity to drive the oxidation of catalytically generated enamines, which ultimately partake in enantioselective radical processes, leading to &#945;&#8208;alkylated aldehydes. Crucially, mechanistic studies highlight how this electrochemical strategy is enabled by the use of a redox shuttle, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxybiphenyl, to prevent catalyst degradation and furnishing the coveted compounds in good yield and high enantioselectivity.

         <title>An Artificial Enzyme for Asymmetric Nitrocyclopropanation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes&#8212;Design and Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generation of an artificial enzyme that features a secondary amine residue by genetic code expansion is described. The designer enzyme was evolved to catalyze the asymmetric nitrocyclopropanation of cinnamaldehydes at high conversions with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The introduction of an abiological catalytic group into the binding pocket of a protein host allows for the expansion of enzyme chemistries. Here, we report the generation of an artificial enzyme by genetic encoding of a non&#8208;canonical amino acid that contains a secondary amine side chain. The non&#8208;canonical amino acid and the binding pocket function synergistically to catalyze the asymmetric nitrocyclopropanation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes by the iminium activation mechanism. The designer enzyme was evolved to an optimal variant that catalyzes the reaction at high conversions with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This work demonstrates the application of genetic code expansion in enzyme design and expands the scope of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed abiological reactions.

         <title>Development of an FeII Complex Exhibiting Intermolecular Proton Shifting Coupled Spin Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline material based on an FeII hydrazone complex was synthesized to observe intermolecular proton shifting. The complex exhibits reversible intermolecular proton shifting&#8208;coupled spin transition. This study paves the way for the development of novel functional materials with tunable properties.







Abstract
In this study, we investigated reversible intermolecular proton shifting (IPS) coupled with spin transition (ST) in a novel FeII complex. The host FeII complex and the guest carboxylic acid anion were connected by intermolecular hydrogen bonds (IHBs). We extended the intramolecular proton transfer coupled ST phenomenon to the intermolecular system. The dynamic phenomenon was confirmed by variable&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron crystallography, and infrared spectroscopy. The mechanism of IPS was further validated using density functional theory calculations. The discovery of IPS&#8208;coupled ST in crystalline molecular materials provides good insights into fundamental processes and promotes the design of novel multifunctional materials with tunable properties for various applications, such as optoelectronics, information storage, and molecular devices.

A novel tetraphenylethene&#8208;based octacationic spirobicycle has been easily synthesized via one&#8208;step bicyclization based on the size&#8208;matching strategy. Through host&#8211;guest interaction with d(GpC) dinucleotide, the spirobicycle can capture a biomimetic hydrogen&#8208;bonded G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C quadruplex within its dual cavities in the crystalline state and show the adaptive chirality sensing in the aqueous solution.







Abstract
In biological systems, nucleotide quadruplexes (such as G&#8208;quadruplexes) in DNA and RNA that are held together by multiple hydrogen bonds play a crucial functional role. The biomimetic formation of these hydrogen&#8208;bonded quadruplexes captured by artificial systems in water poses a significant challenge but can offer valuable insights into these complex functional structures. Herein, we report the formation of biomimetic hydrogen&#8208;bonded G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C quadruplex captured by a tetraphenylethene (TPE) based octacationic spirobicycle (1). The spirobicyclic compound possesses a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) crossing dual&#8208;cavity structure, which enables the encapsulation of four d(GpC) dinucleotide molecules, thereby realizing 1&#8201;:&#8201;4 host&#8211;guest complexation in water. The X&#8208;ray structure reveals that four d(GpC) molecules further form a two&#8208;layer G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C quadruplex with Watson&#8211;Crick hydrogen bonds, which are stabilized within the dual hydrophobic cavities of 1 through the cooperative non&#8208;covalent interactions of hydrogen bonds, CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, and hydrophobic effect. Due to the dynamically&#8208;rotational propeller chirality of TPE units, 1 with adaptive chirality can further serve as a chiroptical sensor to exhibit opposite Cotton effects with mirror&#8208;image CD spectra for the pH&#8208;dependent hydrogen&#8208;bonded assemblies of d(GpC) including the Watson&#8211;Crick G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C (pH&#8197;9.22) and Hoogsteen G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C+ (pH&#8197;5.74) quartets through the host&#8211;guest chirality transfer in water.

         <title>Efficient Tandem Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Click Synthesis of Multisugar&#8208;Modified Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional dendrimeric linker was developed that allows the modification of oligonucleotides in a tandem click reaction with multiple sugars in just one step. The method exploits different click reactivities of the linker azides in a copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction with alkynes. The new method is fast, highly selective and allows the modification of the oligonucleotide with multiple sugars at any given position.







Abstract
Nucleic acids in the form of siRNA, antisense oligonucleotides or mRNA are currently explored as new promising modalities in the pharmaceutical industry. Particularly, the success of mRNA&#8208;vaccines against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, along with the successful development of the first sugar&#8208;modified siRNA therapeutics has inspired the field. The development of nucleic acid therapeutics requires efficient chemistry to link oligonucleotides to chemical structures that can improve stability, boost cellular uptake, or enable specific targeting. For the siRNA therapeutics currently in use, modification of the 3&#8242;&#8208;end of the oligonucleotides with triple&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)3 was shown to be of significance. This modification is currently achieved through cumbersome multistep synthesis and subsequent loading onto the solid support material. Herein, we report the development of a bifunctional click&#8208;reactive linker that allows the modification of oligonucleotides in a tandem click reaction with multiple sugars, regardless of the position within the oligonucleotide, with remarkable efficiency and in a one&#8208;pot reaction.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive &#945;&#8208;Chloro&#8208;Carbonyl Addition of Ketimine to Construct the &#946;&#8208;Tertiary Amino Acid Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive addition reaction of ketimine using &#945;&#8208;chloro carbonyl electrophile has been developed to access diversified enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;tertiary amino acid with excellent enantioselectivity and broad functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility of this protocol includes the efficient assembly of iterative amino acid units and oligopeptide.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Tertiary amino acid derivatives constitute one of the most frequently occurring units in natural products and bioactive molecules. However, the efficient asymmetric synthesis of this motif still remains a significant challenge. Herein, we disclose a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive addition reaction of ketimine using &#945;&#8208;chloro carbonyl compound as a radical precursor, providing expedient access to a diverse array of enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;quaternary amino acid analogues. This protocol exhibits outstanding enantioselectivity and broad substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance. Preliminary mechanism studies rule out the possibility of Reformatsky&#8208;type addition and confirm the involvement of radical species in stereoselective addition process. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated through the rapid assembly of iterative amino acid units and oligopeptide, showcasing its versatile platform for late&#8208;stage modification of drug candidates.

         <title>Boryl Radical as a Catalyst in Enabling Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular Cascade Radical Cyclization Reactions: Construction of Polycyclic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 25, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzimidazolium&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;boryl radical catalyzes cascade cyclization reactions to construct polycyclic compounds both intra&#8208; and intermolecularly. This catalytic cascade radical reaction allows rapid construction of complex molecular architectures through the formation of two or three bonds in a single operation, respectively.







Abstract
Cascade radical cyclization constitutes an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic route for rapid assembly of polycyclic molecular skeletons. Although an array of redox&#8208;active metal catalysts has recently shown robust applications in enabling various catalytic cascade radical processes, the use of free organic radical as the catalyst, which is capable of triggering strategically distinct cascades, has rarely been developed. Here, we disclosed that the benzimidazolium&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;boryl radical is capable of catalyzing cascade cyclization reactions in both intra&#8208; and intermolecular pathways, assembling [5,5] fused bicyclic and [6,6,6] fused tricyclic molecules, respectively. The catalytic reactions start with the chemo&#8208; and regioselective addition of the boryl radical catalyst to a tethered alkene or alkyne moiety, followed by either an intramolecular formal [3+2] or an intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition process to construct bicyclo[3.3.0]octane or tetrahydrophenanthridine skeletons, respectively. Eventually, a &#946;&#8208;elimination occurs to release the boryl radical catalyst, completing a catalytic cycle. High to excellent diastereoselectivity is achieved in both catalytic reactions under substrate control.

         <title>Dissecting Exciton Dynamics in pH&#8208;Activatable Long&#8208;Wavelength Photosensitizers for Traceable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor&#8208;specific activatable long&#8208;wavelength (LW) photosensitizers (PSs) show promise in overcoming the limitations of traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT), such as systemic phototoxicity and shallow tissue penetration. However, their insufficient LW light absorption and low singlet oxygen quantum yield (F1O2) usually require high laser power density to produce thermal energy and synergistically enhance PDT. The strong photothermal radiation causing acute pain significantly reduces patient compliance and hinders the broader clinical application of LW PDT. Through the exciton dynamics dissection strategy, we have developed a series of pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based LW PSs (LET&#8208;R, R = H, Cl, Br, I), among which the activated LET&#8208;I exhibits strong light absorption at 808 nm and a remarkable 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in F1O2 compared to indocyanine green. Transient spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations confirmed its significantly promoted intersystem crossing and simultaneously enhanced LW fluorescence emission characteristics. These features enable the activatable fluorescence and photoacoustic dual&#8208;modal imaging&#8208;escorted complete photodynamic eradication of tumors by the folic acid (FA)&#8208;modified LET&#8208;I probe (LET&#8208;I&#8208;FA), under the ultralow 808 nm laser power density (0.2 W cm&#8208;2) for irradiation, without the need for photothermal energy synergy. This research presents a novel strategy of dissecting exciton dynamics to screen activatable LW PSs for traceable PDT.</dc:description>

The strong photothermal radiation causing acute pain significantly reduces patient compliance and hinders the broader clinical application of LW PDT. Through the exciton dynamics dissection strategy, we have developed a series of pH-activatable cyanine-based LW PSs (LET-R, R = H, Cl, Br, I), among which the activated LET-I exhibits strong light absorption at 808 nm and a remarkable 3.2-fold enhancement in F1O2 compared to indocyanine green. Transient spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations confirmed its significantly promoted intersystem crossing and simultaneously enhanced LW fluorescence emission characteristics. These features enable the activatable fluorescence and photoacoustic dual-modal imaging-escorted complete photodynamic eradication of tumors by the folic acid (FA)-modified LET-I probe (LET-I-FA), under the ultralow 808 nm laser power density (0.2 W cm-2) for irradiation, without the need for photothermal energy synergy.

         <title>Structurally Modulated Formation of Cyanine J&#8208;aggregates with Sharp and Tunable Spectra for Multiplexed Optoacoustic and Fluorescence Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>J&#8208;aggregation brings intriguing optical and electronic properties to molecular dyes and significantly expands their applicability across diverse domains, yet the challenge for rationally designing J&#8208;aggregating dyes persists. Herein, we developed a large number of J&#8208;aggregating dyes from scratch by progressively refining structure of a common heptamethine cyanine. J&#8208;aggregates with sharp spectral bands (full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum &#8201;&#8804; &#8201;38&#8201;nm) are attained by introducing a branched structure featuring a benzyl and a trifluoroacetyl group at meso&#8208;position of dyes. Fine&#8208;tuning the benzyl group enables spectral regulation of J&#8208;aggregates. Analysis of single crystal data of nine dyes reveals a correlation between J&#8208;aggregation propensity and molecular arrangement within crystals. Some J&#8208;aggregates are successfully implemented in multiplexed optoacoustic and fluorescence imaging in animals. Notably, three&#8208;color multispectral optoacoustic tomography imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution is achieved, owing to the sharp and distinct absorption bands of the J&#8208;aggregates.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrate Upcycling Mediated by Organonickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are major environmental pollutants and to neutralize this long&#8208;term environmental threat, new catalytic methods are needed. Although there are biological denitrification processes involving four different enzymatic reactions to convert nitrate (NO3&#8211;) to dinitrogen (N2), it is unfortunately difficult to apply in industry due to the complexity of the processes. In particular, nitrate is difficult to functionalize because of its chemical stability. Thus, there is no organometallic catalysis to convert nitrate to useful chemicals. In this article, we present that a nickel pincer complex is effective as a bifunctional catalyst to stepwise deoxygenate NO3&#8211; by carbonylation and further to C&#8211;N coupling. By using this nickel catalysis, nitrate salts can be selectively transformed into various oximes (&gt;20 substrates) with excellent conversion (&gt;90%). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the highly inert nitrate ion can be functionalized to produce useful chemicals by a new organonickel catalysis. Our results show that the NOx conversion and utilization (NCU) technology is a successful pathway for environmental restoration coupled with value&#8208;added chemical generation.</dc:description>

         <title>Transient Structural Properties of the Rho GDP&#8208;Dissociation Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rho GTPases, master spatial regulators of a wide range of cellular processes, are orchestrated by complex formation with guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDIs). These have been thought to possess an unstructured N&#8208;terminus that inhibits nucleotide exchange of their client upon binding/folding. Via NMR analyses, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical assays, we reveal instead pertinent structural properties transiently maintained both, in the presence and absence of the client, imposed onto the terminus context&#8208;specifically by modulating interactions with the surface of the folded C&#8208;terminal domain. These observations revise the long&#8208;standing textbook picture of the GTPases&#8217; mechanism of membrane extraction. Rather than by a disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transition upon binding of an inhibitory peptide, the intricate and highly selective extraction process of RhoGTPases is orchestrated via a dynamic ensemble bearing preformed transient structural properties, suitably modulated by the specific surrounding along the multi&#8208;step process.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregative Luminescence from CsPbBr&#8323; Perovskite Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the properties of the precursor can provide deeper insight into the crystallization and nucleation mechanisms of perovskites, which is vital for the solution&#8208;process device performance. In this work, we conducted a detailed investigation into the photophysics properties of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite (CsPbBr&#8323;) precursors in a broad concentration and various solvents. The precursor gradually transformed from the solution state into the colloidal state and exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) character as the concentration increased. The aggregative luminescence from the precursors originates from the polybromide plumbous that is formed through the coordination of solvent molecules to the lead metal center. Two adducts with monodentate (PbBr&#8322;&#8901;solvent) and bidentate (PbB&#8322;&#8901;2solvent) ligands can be obtained based on the coordination capability, accompanied by a red and green emission with photoluminescence peak at 610 and 565 nm, respectively. Furthermore, the aggregative luminescence intensity and color could be regulated by changing the solvent and precursor ratio. Besides, we discussed the difference between the molecular aggregate in the organic system and the ionic aggregate in the inorganic system. The fluorescence that is sensitive to Pb&#178;&#8314; coordination reported here could be applied to screen perovskite additives and judge the precursor aging.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Symmetry Breaking&#8208;induced Hubbard Gap Near&#8208;Closure in N&#8208;coordinated MnO2 for Enhanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), however, their performance is hindered by a substantial Hubbard gap, which limits electron transfer and battery cyclability. Addressing this, we introduce a heteroatom coordination approach, using triethanolamine to induce axial N coordination on Mn centers in MnO2, yielding N&#8208;coordinated MnO2 (TEAMO). This approach leverages the change of electronegativity disparity between Mn and ligands (O and N) to disrupt spin symmetry and augment spin polarization. This enhancement leads to the closure of the Hubbard gap, primarily driven by the intensified occupancy of the Mn eg orbitals. The resultant TEAMO exhibit a significant increase in storage capacity, reaching 351 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1. Our findings suggest a viable strategy for optimizing the electronic structure of TMO cathodes, enhancing the potential of ZIBs in energy storage technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(Dibenzothiophene&#8208;Terphenyl Piperidinium) for High&#8208;performance Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The anion exchange membrane water electrolysis is widely regarded as the next&#8208;generation technology for producing green hydrogen. The OH&#8208; conductivity of the anion exchange membrane plays a key role in the practical implementation of this device. Here, we present a series of Z&#8208;S&#8208;x membranes with dibenzothiophene groups. These membranes contain sulfur&#8208;enhanced hydrogen bond networks that link surrounding surface site hopping regions, forming continuous OH&#8208; conducting highways. Z&#8208;S&#8208;20 has a high through&#8208;plane OH&#8208; conductivity of 182 &#177; 28 mS cm&#8208;1 and ultralong stability of 2650 h in KOH solution at 80 &#176;C. Based on rational design, we achieved a high PGM&#8208;free alkaline water electrolysis performance of 7.12 A cm&#8208;2 at 2.0 V in a flow cell and demonstrated durability of 650 h at 2 A cm&#8208;2 at 40 &#176;C with a cell voltage increase of 0.65 mV/h.</dc:description>

Z-S-20 has a high through-plane OH- conductivity of 182 &#177; 28 mS cm-1 and ultralong stability of 2650 h in KOH solution at 80 &#176;C. Based on rational design, we achieved a high PGM-free alkaline water electrolysis performance of 7.12 A cm-2 at 2.0 V in a flow cell and demonstrated durability of 650 h at 2 A cm-2 at 40 &#176;C with a cell voltage increase of 0.65 mV/h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stochastic Sensing of Chloride Anions Using an &#945;&#8208;Hemolysin Pore with semiaza&#8208;Bambusuril Adapter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pores containing molecular adapters provide internal selective binding sites, thereby allowing the stochastic sensing of analytes. Herein, we demonstrate that semiaza&#8208;bambusuril (BU) acts as a non&#8208;covalent molecular adapter when lodged within the lumen of the wild&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;hemolysin (WT&#8208;&#945;HL) protein pore. Because the bambusurils are recognized as anion receptors, the anion binding site within the adapter&#8208;nanopore complex allows the detection of chloride anions, thus converting a non&#8208;selective pore into an anion sensor.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced UV Nonlinear Optical Properties in Layered Germanous Phosphites through Functional Group Sequential Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study pioneers a novel strategy for synthesizing   solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals through functional groups sequential construction, effectively addressing the inherent trade&#8208;offs among broad transmittance, enhanced second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), and optimal birefringence. We have developed two innovative van der Waals layered germanous phosphites: GeHPO3, the first Ge(II)&#8208;based oxide NLO crystal which exhibits a black phosphorus&#8208;like structure, and K(GeHPO3)2Br, distinguished by its exceptional birefringence and graphene&#8208;like structure. Significantly, GeHPO3 exhibits a remarkable array of NLO properties, including the highest SHG coefficient recorded among all NLO crystals for phase&#8208;matching and generating 266 nm coherent light via quadruple frequency conversion. It delivers a potent SHG intensity, surpassing KH2PO4 (KDP) by 10.3 times at 1064 nm and &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4 by 1.3 times at 532 nm, complemented by a distinct UV absorption edge at 211 nm and moderate birefringence of 0.062 at 546 nm. Comprehensive theoretical analysis links these exceptional characteristics to the unique NLO&#8208;active GeO34&#8208; units and the distinctive, highly ordered layered structures. Our findings deliver essential experimental insights into the development of Ge(II)&#8208;based optoelectronic materials and present a strategic blueprint for engineering structure&#8208;driven functional materials with customized properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Activated Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Fluorescence and SERS Dynamic&#8208;Reversible Probes for Long&#8208;Term Assessment of Osteoarthritis In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The abnormal fluctuation of temperature in vivo usually reflects the progression of inflammatory diseases. Noninvasive, real&#8208;time, and accurate monitoring and imaging of temperature variation in vivo is advantageous for guiding the early diagnosis and treatment of disease, but it remains difficult to achieve. Herein, we developed a temperature&#8208;activated near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence (NIR&#8208;II FL) and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoprobe for long&#8208;term monitoring of temperature changes in rat arthritis and timely assessment of the status of osteoarthritis. The thermosensitive polymer bearing NIR&#8208;II FL dye was grafted onto the surface of nanoporous core&#8208;satellite gold nanostructures to form the nanoprobe, wherein the nanoprobe contains NIR&#8208;II FL and Raman reference signals that are independent of temperature change. The ratiometric FL1150/FL1550 and S1528/S2226 values of the nanoprobe exhibited a reversible conversion with temperature changes. The nanoprobe accurately distinguishes the temperature variations in the inflamed joint versus the normal joint in vivo by ratiometric FL and SERS imaging, allowing for an accurate diagnosis of inflammation. Meanwhile, it can continuously monitor fluctuations in temperature over an extended period during the onset and treatment of inflammation. The tested temperature change trend could be used as an indicator for early diagnosis of inflammation and real&#8208;time evaluation of therapeutic effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Cross&#8208;Electrophile C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) Coupling via a NiII Aryl Amido Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) between aryl halides and alkyl halides is a streamlined approach for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond construction, which is highly valuable in medicinal chemistry. Based on a key NiII aryl amido intermediate, we developed a highly selective and scalable Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical XEC reaction between (hetero)aryl halides and primary and secondary alkyl halides. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that an amine secondary ligand slows down the oxidative addition process of the Ni&#8208;polypyridine catalyst to the aryl bromide and a NiII aryl amido intermediate is formed in&#8208;situ during the reaction process. The relatively slow oxidative addition is beneficial for enhancing the selectivity of the XEC reaction. The NiII aryl amido intermediate stabilizes the NiII&#8722;aryl species to prevent the aryl&#8722;aryl homo&#8208;coupling side reactions and acts as a catalyst to activate the alkyl bromide substrates. This electrosynthesis system provides a facile, practical, and scalable platform for the formation of (hetero)aryl&#8722;alkyl bonds using standard Ni catalysts under mild conditions. The mechanistic insights from this work could serve as a great foundation for future studies on Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a photochemical method for the semipinacol rearrangement of unactivated allylic alcohols. Aliphatic as well as aromatic groups participate as migrating groups, yielding a variety of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketones.

The operationally simple and fully catalytic conditions prescribe 1 mol% benzothiazinoquinoxaline as organophotocatalyst, 0.5 mol% Co&#8208;salen, and 10 mol% lutidinium triflate and, importantly, display reactivity complementary to procedures employing Br&#248;nsted acid.

         <title>Picturing the Gap Between the Performance and US&#8208;DOE's Hydrogen Storage Target: A Data&#8208;Driven Model for MgH2 Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a data&#8208;driven strategy, we developed models to illustrate the structure&#8208;performance relationships of MgH2&#8208;based materials in solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage. This model also shows the current gap between their performance and the US&#8208;DOE goal.







Abstract
Developing solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage materials is as pressing as ever, which requires a comprehensive understanding of the dehydrogenation chemistry of a solid&#8208;state hydride. Transition state search and kinetics calculations are essential to understanding and designing high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage materials by filling in the knowledge gap that current experimental techniques cannot measure. However, the ab initio analysis of these processes is computationally expensive and time&#8208;consuming. Searching for descriptors to accurately predict the energy barrier is urgently needed, to accelerate the prediction of hydrogen storage material properties and identify the opportunities and challenges in this field. Herein, we develop a data&#8208;driven model to describe and predict the dehydrogenation barriers of a typical solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage material, magnesium hydride (MgH2), based on the combination of the crystal Hamilton population orbital of Mg&#8722;H bond and the distance between atomic hydrogen. By deriving the distance energy ratio, this model elucidates the key chemistry of the reaction kinetics. All the parameters in this model can be directly calculated with significantly less computational cost than conventional transition state search, so that the dehydrogenation performance of hydrogen storage materials can be predicted efficiently. Finally, we found that this model leads to excellent agreement with typical experimental measurements reported to date and provides clear design guidelines on how to propel the performance of MgH2 closer to the target set by the United States Department of Energy (US&#8208;DOE).

         <title>A Versatile Microfluidic Platform for Extravasation Studies Based on DNA Origami&#8212;Cell Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic device to study cancer cell extravasation that mimics the endothelial barrier using a porous membrane decorated with DNA origami nanostructures displaying adhesion peptides to circulating cancer cells. The device allows visualization of cell transmigration under physiological flow conditions, revealing influences of adhesion peptide type, spatial arrangement, and density on the extravasation of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells.







Abstract
The adhesion of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to the endothelial lumen and their extravasation to surrounding tissues are crucial in the seeding of metastases and remain the most complex events of the metastatic cascade to study. Integrins expressed on CTCs are major regulators of the extravasation process. This knowledge is primarily derived from animal models and biomimetic systems based on artificial endothelial layers, but these methods have ethical or technical limitations. We present a versatile microfluidic device to study cancer cell extravasation that mimics the endothelial barrier by using a porous membrane functionalized with DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) that display nanoscale patterns of adhesion peptides to circulating cancer cells. The device simulates physiological flow conditions and allows direct visualization of cell transmigration through microchannel pores using 3D confocal imaging. Using this system, we studied integrin&#8208;specific adhesion in the absence of other adhesive events. Specifically, we show that the transmigration ability of the metastatic cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 is influenced by the type, distance, and density of adhesion peptides present on the DONs. Furthermore, studies with mixed ligand systems indicate that integrins binding to RGD (arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid) and IDS (isoleucine&#8208;aspartic acid&#8208;serine) did not synergistically enhance the extravasation process of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells.

         <title>Ligand Meta&#8208;Anchoring Strategy in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Remarkable Promotion of Quantum Yields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy is reported to promote the quantum yields of luminescent metal&#8211;organic frameworks through the restriction of intramolecular motions.







Abstract
Aggregation is a conventional method to enhance the quantum yields (QYs) of pure organic luminophores due to the restriction of intramolecular motions (RIM). However, how to realize RIM in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is still unclear and challenging. In this work, the ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy is first proposed and proved to be an effective and systematic approach to restrict the intramolecular motions of MOFs for the QY improvement. By simply shifting the substituent position in the ligand from para to meta, the QY of the resulting MOF is significantly enhanced by eleven&#8208;fold. The value is even higher than that of ligand aggregates, demonstrating the strong RIM effect of this ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy. The introduction of co&#8208;ligand induces the appearance of visible yellow room temperature phosphorescence with a lifetime of 222&#8197;ms due to the QY enhancement and the charge transfer between the donor and accepter units. The present work thus broadens the understanding of the RIM mechanism from a new perspective, develops a novel method to realize RIM and expands the applicable objects from pure organic materials to organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Enhanced Photoreforming of Biomass Furans over a Urea&#8208;Incorporated Cu(II) Porphyrin Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A urea&#8208;incorporated porphyrin framework can activate molecular oxygen to generate selectively &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 and enable the flat adsorption of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural in a low&#8208;energy configuration leveraging on hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, leading to highly efficient photo&#8208;oxidation that produces bioplastic monomers from renewable feedstocks without over&#8208;oxidation and photo&#8208;corrosion.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven upgrading of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxylmethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) holds great promise for sustainable production of bio&#8208;plastics and resins. However, the process is limited by poor selectivity and sluggish kinetics due to the vertical coordination of HMF at relatively strong metal sites. Here, we purposely developed a Cu(II) porphyrin framework featuring side&#8208;chain incorporated urea linkages, denoted as TBUPP&#8722;Cu MOF, to render HMF a weak hydrogen bond at the urea site and flat adsorption via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking with the benzene moiety. The unique configuration promotes the approaching of &#8722;CHO of HMF to the photoexcited porphyrin ring towards kinetically and thermodynamically favourable intermediate formation and subsequent desorption. The charge localisation and orbital energy alignment enable the selective activation of O2 over the porphyrin to generate &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 instead of highly oxidative H2O2 and &#8901;OH via spin&#8208;flip electron transfer, which drive the ambient oxidation of proximal &#8722;CHO. The effective utilisation of redox species and circumvented over&#8208;oxidation facilitate a FDCA selectivity of &gt;90&#8201;% with a high turnover number of 193&#8197;molHMF&#8201;molCu&#8722;1. The facile purification of high&#8208;purity FDCA and zero&#8208;waste recycling of intermediates and durable catalyst feature TBUPP&#8722;Cu MOF a promising photo&#8208;oxidation platform towards net&#8208;zero biorefining and organic transformations.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Growth of Convex Sphere with Adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) Interfaces for Effective C2 Production from CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tightly&#8208;coupled adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface manufactured by a bottom&#8208;up growth strategy exhibits outstanding selectivity and stability of CO2RR. The convex sphere with the favorable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface promotes the dimerization of localized *CO adsorbate, thus form the C2 products with a lowered energy barrier.







Abstract
One challenge confronting the Cu2O catalysts in the electrocatalysis of carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is the reduction of active Cu(I) species, resulting in low selectivity and quick deactivation. In this study, we for the first time introduce a bottom&#8208;up growth of convex sphere with adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interfaces (Cux@Cu2O convex spheres). Interestingly, the interfaces are dynamically modulated by varying hydrothermal time, thus regulating the conversion of C1 and C2 products. In particular, the 4&#8197;h hydrothermal treatment applied to Cu0.25@Cu2O convex sphere with the favorable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface results in the highest selectivity for C2 products (90.5&#8201;%). In situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface lowers the energy barrier for the production of ethylene and ethanol while increasing the coverage of localized *CO adsorbate for increased dimerization. This work establishes a novel approach for transforming the state of valence&#8208;sensitive electrocatalysts into high&#8208;value energy&#8208;related engineering products.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Driven Dispersion of Bismuth Nanoparticles among Carbon Matrix for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique thermal&#8208;driven strategy is proposed to re&#8208;disperse bismuth core into nanoparticles among porous carbon shell, inhibiting the aggregation to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability.







Abstract
The poor electrocatalytic stability and rapid deactivation of metal electrocatalysts are always present in the electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to the harsh reduction condition. Herein, we demonstrate the controllable dispersion of ultrafine bismuth nanoparticles among the hollow carbon shell (Bi@C&#8208;700&#8208;4) simply by a thermal&#8208;driven diffusion process. The confinement effect of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix is able to low the surface energy of bismuth nanoparticles against the easy aggregation commonly observed for the thermal treatment.

     alt="Thermal-Driven Dispersion of Bismuth Nanoparticles among Carbon Matrix for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unique thermal-driven strategy is proposed to re-disperse bismuth core into nanoparticles among porous carbon shell, inhibiting the aggregation to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor electrocatalytic stability and rapid deactivation of metal electrocatalysts are always present in the electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) due to the harsh reduction condition. Herein, we demonstrate the controllable dispersion of ultrafine bismuth nanoparticles among the hollow carbon shell (Bi@C-700-4) simply by a thermal-driven diffusion process. The confinement effect of nitrogen-doped carbon matrix is able to low the surface energy of bismuth nanoparticles against the easy aggregation commonly observed for the thermal treatment. On the basis of the synergistic effect and confinement effect between bismuth nanoparticles and carbon matrix, the highly dispersed active sites render the obviously improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction into formate. The in situ experimental observations on the reduction process and theoretical calculations reveal that the incorporation of bismuth nanoparticles with nitrogen-doped carbon matrix would promote the activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the easy formation of key intermediate (*OCHO), thus leading the enhanced electrocatalytic activity, with a Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of formate about 94.8&#8201;% and the long-time stability. Furthermore, the coupling of an anode for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) in solar-driven system renders the high 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) yield of 81.2&#8201;%, presenting the impressive solar-to-fuel conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Kinase Inhibition via Small Molecule&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Protein Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report ynamide&#8208;based, small&#8208;molecule inhibitors capable of inducing intramolecular cross&#8208;linking of kinases, leading to subsequent irreversible inhibition of kinase activity. This strategy exploits the close distance between highly conserved catalytic K and E/D residues present in almost all protein kinases, thus providing a conceptually general approach to achieve irreversible kinase inhibition with high specificity and cellular potency.







Abstract
Remarkable progress has been made in the development of cysteine&#8208;targeted covalent inhibitors. In kinase drug discovery, covalent inhibitors capable of targeting other nucleophilic residues (i.e. lysine, or K) have emerged in recent years. Besides a highly conserved catalytic lysine, almost all human protein kinases possess an equally conserved glutamate/aspartate (e.g. E/D) that forms a K&#8211;E/D salt bridge within the enzyme's active site. Electrophilic ynamides were previously used as effective peptide coupling reagents and to develop E/D&#8208;targeting covalent protein inhibitors/probes. In the present study, we report the first ynamide&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule inhibitors capable of inducing intramolecular cross&#8208;linking of various protein kinases, leading to subsequent irreversible inhibition of kinase activity. Our strategy took advantage of the close distance between the highly conserved catalytic K and E/D residues in a targeted kinase, thus providing a conceptually general approach to achieve irreversible kinase inhibition with high specificity and desirable cellular potency. Finally, this ynamide&#8208;facilitated, ligand&#8208;induced mechanism leading to intramolecular kinase cross&#8208;linking and inhibition was unequivocally established by using recombinant ABL kinase as a representative.

Cyclotetramerization of 2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyrroles affords a novel class of C4&#8208;symmetric Caryl&#8722;C&#946; (C3, C8, C13, C18) axially chiral porphyrins in good yields. Both regioisomers of the Ir&#8208;complex catalyze efficiently the carbene C(sp3)&#8722;H insertion reaction.







Abstract
A hitherto unknown class of C4&#8208;symmetric Caryl&#8722;C&#946; (C3, C8, C13, C18) axially chiral porphyrins has been synthesized and the application of their iridium (Ir) complexes in catalytic asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization is documented. Cyclotetramerization of enantioenriched axially chiral 2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;3&#8208;naphthyl pyrroles under mild acidic conditions affords, after oxidation with 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ), the C4&#8208;symmetric &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;atropenantiomer as an only isolable diastereomer. Both regioisomeric Ir(Por*)(CO)(Cl) complexes catalyze the carbene C&#8722;H insertion reaction affording the same enantiomer, albeit with slight difference in enantioselectivity. With the optimum Ir&#8208;complex 3&#8201;e, the 2&#8208;substituted arylacetic acid derivatives were generated from diazo compounds and cyclohexadiene in excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

Abstract
Although beryllium and its compounds show outstanding properties, owing to its toxic potential and extreme reaction conditions the chemistry of Be under high&#8208;pressure conditions has only been investigated sparsely. Herein, we report on the highly condensed wurtzite&#8208;type Be2PN3, which was synthesized from Be3N2 and P3N5 in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 9&#8197;GPa and 1500&#8201;&#176;C. It is the missing member in the row of formula type M2PN3 (M&#160;=&#160;Mg, Zn). The structure was elucidated by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), revealing that Be2PN3 is a double nitride, rather than a nitridophosphate. The structural model was further corroborated by 9Be and 31P solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We present 9Be NMR data for tetrahedral nitride coordination for the first time. Infrared and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (FTIR and EDX), as well as temperature dependent PXRD complement the analytical characterization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal super&#8208;incompressible behavior and the remarkable hardness of this low&#8208;density material. The formation of Be2PN3 through a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach expands the synthetic access to Be&#8208;containing compounds and may open access to various multinary beryllium nitrides.

         <title>Chiral Ligand&#8208;Concentration Mediating Asymmetric Transformations of Silver Nanoclusters: NIR&#8208;II Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence Lighting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral ligand&#8208;concentration mediating asymmetric transformations of silver nanoclusters realize visible and second near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized phosphorescences.







Abstract
Near infrared (NIR) emitter with circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP), known as NIR CPP, has emerged as a key part in the research of cutting&#8208;edge luminescent materials. However, it remains a challenge to obtain nanoclusters with NIR CPP activity. Here, we propose an asymmetric transformation approach to efficiently synthesize two pairs of chiral silver nanoclusters (R/S&#8208;Ag29 and R/S&#8208;Ag16) using an achiral Ag10 nanocluster as starting material in the presence of different concentration chiral inducer (R/S)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl hydrogenphosphate (R/S&#8208;BNP). R/S&#8208;Ag29, formed in the low&#8208;concentration R/S&#8208;BNP, exhibits a unique kernel&#8208;shell structure consisting of a distorted Ag13 icosahedron and an integrated cage&#8208;like organometallic shell with a C3 symmetry, and possesses a superatomic 6&#8208;electron configuration (1S2|1P4). By contrast, R/S&#8208;Ag16, formed in the high&#8208;concentration R/S&#8208;BNP, features a sandwich&#8208;like pentagram with AgI&#8208;pure kernel. Profiting from the hierarchically chiral structures and superatomic kernel&#8208;dominated phosphorescence, R/S&#8208;Ag29 exhibits infrequent CPP activity in the second near&#8208;infrared (975&#8197;nm) region, being the first instance of NIR&#8208;II CPP observed among CPL&#8208;active metal nanoclusters. This study presents a new approach to reduce the difficulty of de novo synthesis for chiral silver nanomaterials, and facilitates the design of CPP&#8208;active superatomic nanoclusters in NIR region.

&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, and possesses a superatomic 6-electron configuration (1S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|1P&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;). By contrast, &lt;i&gt;

         <title>Kinetic Resolution Polymerization Enabled Chemical Synthesis of Perfectly Isotactic Polythioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of chemically synthetic methods to prepare isotactic polythioesters (PTEs) has been a formidable challenge. Here we report the successful synthesis of a perfectly isotactic PTE via stereocontrolled ring&#8208;opening polymerization catalysed by binaphthalene&#8208;salen aluminium (SalBinam&#8208;Al). This kinetic resolution polymerization enabled the facile isolation of enantiopure monomer, which could efficiently convert to an important pharmaceutical building block.







Abstract
Isotactic polythioesters (PTEs) that are thioester analogs to natural polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have attracted growing attention due to their distinct properties. However, the development of chemically synthetic methods for preparing isotactic PTEs has long been an intricate endeavour. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of perfectly isotactic PTEs via stereocontrolled ring&#8208;opening polymerization. This binaphthalene&#8208;salen aluminium (SalBinam&#8208;Al) catalyst promoted a robust polymerization of rac&#8208;&#945;&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;propiothiolactones (rac&#8208;BTL and rac&#8208;PTL) with highly kinetic resolution, affording perfectly isotactic P(BTL) and P(PTL) with Mn up to 276&#8197;kDa. Impressively, the isotactic P(BTL) formed a supramolecular stereocomplex with improved thermal property (Tm=204&#8201;&#176;C). Ultimately, this kinetic resolution polymerization enabled the facile isolation of enantiopure (S)&#8208;BTL, which could efficiently convert to an important pharmaceutical building block (S)&#8208;2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercapto&#8208;propanoic acid. Isotactic P(PTL) served as a tough and ductile material comparable to the commercialized polyolefins. This synthetic system allowed to access of isotactic PTEs, establishing a powerful platform for the discovery of sustainable plastics.

         <title>2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Bearing Large Pore Apertures and Multiple Active Sites for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two mesoporous 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF and PA&#8208;PyTTA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF) were synthesized as cathode host materials for polyiodides in aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries. Among them, PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF, distinguished by the largest pore size (3.9&#8197;nm) among reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs, demonstrated higher specific capacity (423.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and exceptional cycling performance (maintaining 96&#8201;% capacity over 1000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) with large pore sizes and high surface areas are advantageous for adsorbing iodine species to enhance the electrochemical performance of aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries (ADIBs). However, most of the reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs feature microporous structures, with few examples exhibiting mesoporous characteristics. Herein, we developed two mesoporous 2D c&#8208;MOFs, namely PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF and PA&#8208;PyTTA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF, using newly designed arylimide based multitopic catechol ligands (6OH&#8208;PA&#8208;TAPA and 8OH&#8208;PA&#8208;PyTTA). Notably, PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF exhibits the largest pore sizes (3.9&#8197;nm) among all reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these 2D c&#8208;MOFs can serve as promising cathode host materials for polyiodides in ADIBs for the first time. The incorporation of triphenylamine moieties in PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF resulted in a higher specific capacity (423.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and superior cycling performance, retaining 96&#8201;% capacity over 1000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 compared to PA&#8208;PyTTA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF. Our comparative analysis revealed that the increased number of N anchoring sites and larger pore size in PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF facilitate efficient anchoring and conversion of I3&#8722;, as supported by spectroscopic electrochemistry and density functional theory calculations.

         <title>A New Family of High Oxidation State Antiperovskite Nitrides: La3MN5 (M=Cr, Mn and Mo)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
La3MN5 (M=Cr, Mn, and Mo) are the first examples of ternary antiperovskite (Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type) nitrides containing [MN4]6&#8722; anions for M=Cr and Mo, but for M=Mn off&#8208;stoichiometry modelled by excess&#8208;nitride clusters gives La3MnN5.30 with Mn oxidised almost to the +7 state. This is the first report of excess&#8208;anion incorporation into Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type materials, and this or other mechanisms may enable many other high oxidation state transition metal nitrides to be prepared.







Abstract
Three new nitrides La3MN5 (M=Cr, Mn, and Mo) have been synthesized using a high pressure azide route. These are the first examples of ternary Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type nitrides, and show that this (MN4)NLa3 antiperovskite structure type may be used to stabilise high oxidation&#8208;state transition metals in tetrahedral molecular [MN4]n&#8722; nitridometallate anions. Magnetic measurements confirm that Cr and Mo are in the M6+ state, but the M=Mn phase has an anomalously small paramagnetic moment and large cell volume. Neutron powder diffraction data are fitted using an anion&#8208;excess La3MnN5.30 model (space group I4/mcm, a=6.81587(9)&#8197;&#197; and c=11.22664(18)&#8197;&#197; at 200&#8197;K) in which Mn is close to the +7 state. Excess&#8208;anion incorporation into Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type materials has not been previously reported, and this or other substitution mechanisms may enable many other high oxidation state transition metal nitrides to be prepared.

         <title>Design of Solid Polycationic Electrolyte to Enable Durable Chloride&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a room&#8208;temperature chloride&#8208;ion battery based on a low&#8208;cost Al metal anode supported by a solid polycation electrolyte. This polycation electrolyte tailors a coordination structure that facilitates ions transport and eliminates hazard issues, thus enabling Al||FeOCl cells with high capacity, excellent interfacial compatibility, and long lifespan.







Abstract
The high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness of chloride&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) make them promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the development of CIBs is greatly restricted by the lack of compatible electrolytes to support cost&#8208;effective anodes. Herein, we present a rationally designed solid polycationic electrolyte (SPE) to enable room&#8208;temperature chloride&#8208;ion batteries utilizing aluminum (Al) metal as an anode. This SPE endows the CIB configuration with improved air stability and safety (i.e. free of flammability and liquid leakage). A high ionic conductivity (1.3&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) has been achieved by the well&#8208;tailored coordination structure of the SPE. Meanwhile, the solid polycationic electrolyte ensures stable electrodes|electrolyte interfaces, which effectively inhibit the growth of dendrites on the Al anodes and degradation of the FeOCl cathodes. The Al|SPE|FeOCl chloride&#8208;ion batteries showcased a high discharge capacity around 250&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (based on the cathodes) and extended lifespan. Our electrolyte design opens a new avenue for developing low&#8208;cost chloride&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;We report a room-temperature chloride-ion battery based on a low-cost Al metal anode supported by a solid polycation electrolyte. This polycation electrolyte tailors a coordination structure that facilitates ions transport and eliminates hazard issues, thus enabling Al||FeOCl cells with high capacity, excellent interfacial compatibility, and long lifespan.

         <title>Molecular Wiring of Electrocatalytic Nitrate reduction to Ammonia and Water Oxidation by Iron&#8208;Coordinated Macroporous Conductive Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach for synthesis of single&#8208;site active iron electrocatalysts is reported by integration of a solvated iron complex in conductive organic networks. Sufficient coordinatively unsaturated active sites can be created electrochemically for simultaneous NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3 and H2O oxidation to O2 in basic media.







Abstract
Developing stable electrocatalysts with accessible isolated sites is desirable but highly challenging due to metal agglomeration and low surface stability of host materials. Here we report a general approach for synthesis of single&#8208;site Fe electrocatalysts by integrating a solvated Fe complex in conductive macroporous organic networks through redox&#8208;active coordination linkages. Electrochemical activation of the electrode exposes high&#8208;density coordinately unsaturated Fe sites for efficient adsorption and conversion of reaction substrates such as NO3&#8722; and H2O. Using the electrode with isolated active Fe sites, electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction and H2O oxidation can be coupled in a single cell to produce NH3 and O2 at Faradaic efficiencies of 97&#8201;% and 100&#8201;%, respectively. The electrode exhibits excellent robustness in electrocatalysis for 200&#8197;hours with small decrease in catalytic efficiencies. Both the maximized Fe&#8208;site efficiency and the microscopic localization effect of the conductive organic matrix contribute to the high catalytic performances, which provides new understandings in tuning the efficiencies of metal catalysts for high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic cells.

         <dc:description>
A class of (S)&#8208;H8&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived chiral &#951;6&#8208;benzene ligands has been developed, which can coordinate with ruthenium(II) highly site&#8208;selectively.The related chiral ruthenium(II) catalysts proved highly effective for the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines with alkynes, affording a series of chiral spirocyclic sultams in up to 99&#8201;% yield with up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Given the tremendous success of (p&#8208;cymene)RuII&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation over the past 20&#8197;years, the community has long been aware that the development of chiral &#951;6&#8208;benzene (Ben) ligands should be a potent strategy for achieving the attractive but incredibly underdeveloped ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation. However, it has rarely been achieved due to the severe difficulty in developing proper chiral Ben ligands. In particular, designing chiral Ben ligands by connecting a benzene fragment to a chiral framework including benzene rings remained an unsolved challenge until this effort. Here we present a novel class of axially chiral Ben ligands derived from readily available (S)&#8208;5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;,7,7&#8242;,8,8&#8242;&#8208;octahydro&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol ((S)&#8208;H8&#8208;BINOL) in 4&#8211;8 steps. Notably, when coordinated with ruthenium, such chiral Ben ligand containing three benzene rings only forms one of the three possible isomeric BenRuII complexes. The related chiral BenRuII catalysts could effectively catalyze the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines with alkynes, affording a range of chiral spirocyclic sultams in up to 99&#8201;% yield with up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee. These catalysts are expected to find broad applications in future.

         <title>Kinetic Control of Complexity in Multiple Dynamic Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report how all the components of two dynamic libraries generated by two reversible processes, were eventually funneled towards kinetically inert structures that contain parts from both libraries, causing a collapse of the complexity. Moreover, such intercommunication can be designed to be latent, and emergent supramolecular and luminescent properties could be modified by simply activating the communication.







Abstract
Multiple dynamic libraries of compounds are generated when more than one reversible reaction comes into play. Commonly, two or more orthogonal reversible reactions are used, leading to non&#8208;communicating dynamic libraries which share no building blocks. Only a few examples of communicating libraries have been reported, and in all those cases, building blocks are reversibly exchanged from one library to the other, constituting an antiparallel dynamic covalent system. Herein we report that communication between two different dynamic libraries through an irreversible process is also possible. Indeed, alkyl amines cancel the dynamic regime on the nucleophilic substitution of tetrazines, generating kinetically inert compounds. Interestingly, such amine can be part of another dynamic library, an imine&#8208;amine exchange. Thus, both libraries are interconnected with each other by an irreversible process which leads to kinetically inert structures that contain parts from both libraries, causing a collapse of the complexity. Additionally, a latent irreversible intercommunication could be developed. In such a way, a stable molecular system with specific host&#8211;guest and fluorescence properties, could be irreversibly transformed when the right stimulus was applied, triggering the cancellation of the original supramolecular and luminescent properties and the emergence of new ones.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Driven Efficient Conversion of CO2 and H2O into Pure Syngas with Controllable Wide H2/CO Ratios over Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Featuring In Situ Evolved Ligand Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient plasma&#8208;driven catalytic conversion of CO2 and confined H2O into pure syngas with controllable wide H2/CO ratios is presented. The ligand defect&#8208;induced in situ dynamic structure evolution of porous MOF catalyst favors the generation of coordinatively unsaturated metal active sites with optimized geometric and electronic characteristics and the resultantly reduced energy barriers of syngas&#8208;production potential&#8208;determining steps.







Abstract
While the mild production of syngas (a mixture of H2 and CO) from CO2 and H2O is a promising alternative to the coal&#8208;based chemical engineering technologies, the inert nature of CO2 molecules, unfavorable splitting pathways of H2O and unsatisfactory catalysts lead to the challenge in the difficult integration of high CO2 conversion efficiency with produced syngas with controllable H2/CO ratios in a wide range. Herein, we report an efficient plasma&#8208;driven catalytic system for mild production of pure syngas over porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) catalysts with rich confined H2O molecules, where their syngas production capacity is regulated by the in situ evolved ligand defects and the plasma&#8208;activated intermediate species of CO2 molecules. Specially, the Cu&#8208;based catalyst system achieves 61.9&#8201;% of CO2 conversion and the production of pure syngas with wide H2/CO ratios of 0.05&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8211;4.3&#8201;:&#8201;1. As revealed by the experimental and theoretical calculation results, the in situ dynamic structure evolution of Cu&#8208;containing MOF catalysts favors the generation of coordinatively unsaturated metal active sites with optimized geometric and electronic characteristics, the adsorption of reactants, and the reduced energy barriers of syngas&#8208;production potential&#8208;determining steps of the hydrogenation of CO2 to *COOH and the protonation of H2O to *H.

Specially, the Cu-based catalyst system achieves 61.9&#8201;% of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion and the production of pure syngas with wide H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO ratios of 0.05&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8211;4.3&#8201;:&#8201;1. As revealed by the experimental and theoretical calculation results, the in situ dynamic structure evolution of Cu-containing MOF catalysts favors the generation of coordinatively unsaturated metal active sites with optimized geometric and electronic characteristics, the adsorption of reactants, and the reduced energy barriers of syngas-production potential-determining steps of the hydrogenation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to *COOH and the protonation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to *H.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dimensional Regulation in Metal&#8208;Free Perovskites by Compositional Engineering to Achieve Record Low X&#8208;Ray Detection Limits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work innovatively utilizes compositional engineering to tailor octahedra, achieving a dimensional evolution in metal&#8208;free perovskites, and reports on metal&#8208;free perovskites with a two&#8208;dimensional structure for the first time. With the evolution in dimensions, there is a significant variation in their fluorescence and X&#8208;ray detection capabilities. Importantly, the 2D SC&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector achieved an ultra&#8208;low LOD of 12.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Utilizing the manipulation of perovskite dimensions has been proven as an effective approach in regulating perovskite properties. Nevertheless, achieving precise control over the dimensions of perovskites within the same system poses a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a sophisticated method to attain precise dimensional control in metal&#8208;free perovskites (MFPs), specifically through the process of octahedron tailoring by compositional engineering. Accordingly, we successfully instigated a transition from HPIP&#8722;NH4I3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O (3D), HPIP2&#8722;NH4I5 (2D) and HPIP3&#8722;NH4I7 (1D) structures. Notably, HPIP2&#8722;NH4I5 is the first 2D MFP. As anticipated, these perovskites exhibited completely distinct fluorescence and X&#8208;ray detection capabilities due to their differing dimensions. Remarkably, the 2D HPIP2&#8722;NH4I5 device effectively hindered ion migration perpendicular to the 2D layers, achieving the lowest detection limit of 12.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 among metal&#8208;free single crystals&#8208;based detectors. This study expands the dimensionality control strategies for MFPs and introduces, for the first time, the potential of 2D MFPs as high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detectors, thereby enriching the diversity of the MFPs family.

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Fields in Heterostructured Lamellar Membranes Enable Highly Efficient Rejection of Charged Mass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D nanochannels with built&#8208;in electric fields were constructed by assembling the heterostructured nanosheets to manipulate ion transport, achieving a high rejection of salts, dyes, and organic acids/bases and simultaneously ultrafast water transport, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art homogeneous charge nanochannel membranes.







Abstract
Separation membranes with homogeneous charge channels are the mainstream to reject charged mass by forming electrical double layer (EDL). However, the EDL often compresses effective solvent transport space and weakens channel&#8208;ion interaction. Here, built&#8208;in electric fields (BIEFs) are constructed in lamellar membranes by assembling the heterostructured nanosheets, which contain alternate positively&#8208;charged nanodomains and negatively&#8208;charged nanodomains. We demonstrate that the BIEFs are perpendicular to horizontal channel and the direction switches alternately, significantly weakening the EDL effect and forces ions to repeatedly collide with channel walls. Thus, highly efficient rejection for charged mass (salts, dyes, and organic acids/bases) and ultrafast water transport are achieved. Moreover, for desalination on four&#8208;stage filtration option, salt rejection reaches 99.9&#8201;% and water permeance reaches 19.2&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1. Such mass transport behavior is quite different from that in homogeneous charge channels. Furthermore, the ion transport behavior in nanochannels is elucidated by validating horizontal projectile motion model.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Redox&#8208;Neutral [3+2] Photocycloadditions of Cyclopropyl Ketones with Vinylazaarenes Enabled by Consecutive Photoinduced Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ConPET as a powerful and novel technique for photoredox catalysis has been first employed in asymmetric synthesis. In collaboration with chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis, an unprecedented redox&#8208;neutral [3+2] photocycloaddition has been developed, facilitating the synthesis of a wide range of valuable azaarene&#8208;functionalized cyclopentyl ketones with high yields, ees and dr.







Abstract
Consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPET) is a powerful and atom&#8208;economical protocol to overcome the limitations of the intrinsic redox potential of visible light&#8208;absorbing photosensitizers, thereby considerably improving the substrate and reaction types. Likely because such an exothermic single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process usually does not require the aid of chiral catalysts, resulting in an inevitable racemic background reaction, notably, no enantioselective manifolds have been reported. Herein, we report on the viability of cooperative ConPET and chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis for the [3+2] photocycloaddition of cyclopropyl ketones with vinylazaarenes. In addition to enabling the first use of olefins that preferentially interact with chiral catalysts, this catalysis platform paves the way for the efficient synthesis of pharmaceutically and synthetically important cyclopentyl ketones functionalized by azaarenes with high yields, ees and dr. The robust capacity of the method can be further highlighted by the low loading of the chiral catalyst (1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;%), the good compatibility of both 2&#8208;azaarene and 3&#8208;pyridine&#8208;based olefins, and the successful concurrent construction of three stereocenters on cyclopentane rings involving an elusive but important all&#8208;carbon quaternary.

         <title>Construction of Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Poly(heptazine imide) Nanosheets via Hydrogen Bonds for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The creation of frustrated Lewis pairs on catalyst surface is an effective strategy for tuning CO2 activation. The critical step in the formation of frustrated Lewis pairs is the spatial effect of proximal Lewis acid&#8208;Lewis base pairs. Here, we demonstrate a facile surface functionalization methodology that enables hydrogen bonding between N and H atoms to mediate the construction of frustrated Lewis pairs in poly(heptazine imide), thereby increasing the propensity to activate CO2 molecules. Experimental and theoretical results show that the construction of active hydrogen bonding regions can facilitate the bending of CO2 molecules. Furthermore, the delocalization of electron clouds induced by the hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated frustrated Lewis pairs can promote the heterolytic cleavage and photocatalytic conversion of CO2. This work highlights the potential of utilizing hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated strategy in heterogeneously photocatalytic activation of CO2 over polymer materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Ionic Selectivity and Osmotic Energy by Using an Ultrathin Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;Based Heterogeneous Membrane with Trilayered Continuous Porous Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing a nanofluidic membrane with high selectivity and fast ion transport property is the key towards high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion. However, most of reported membranes can produce power density less than commercial benchmark (5 W/m2), due to the imbalance between ion selectivity and permeability. Here, we report a novel nanoarchitectured design of a heterogeneous membrane with an ultrathin and dense zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) layer and a highly aligned and interconnected branched alumina nanochannel membrane. The design leads to a continuous trilayered pore structure of large geometry gradient in the sequence from angstrom&#8208;scale to nano&#8208;scale to sub&#8208;microscale, which enables the enhanced directional ion transport, and the angstrom&#8208;sized (~6.6&#8208;7 &#197;) UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 windows render the membrane with high ion selectivity. Consequently, the novel heterogeneous membrane can achieve a high&#8208;performance power of ~8 W/m2 by mixing synthetic seawater and river water. The power density can be largely upgraded to an ultrahigh ~17.1 W/m2 along with ~48.5% conversion efficiency at a 50&#8208;fold KCl gradient. This work not only presents a new membrane design approach but also showcases the great potential of employing the zirconium&#8208;based MOF channels as ion&#8208;channel&#8208;mimetic membranes for highly efficient blue energy harvesting.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Designing a nanofluidic membrane with high selectivity and fast ion transport property is the key towards high-performance osmotic energy conversion. However, most of reported membranes can produce power density less than commercial benchmark (5 W/m2), due to the imbalance between ion selectivity and permeability. Here, we report a novel nanoarchitectured design of a heterogeneous membrane with an ultrathin and dense zirconium-based UiO-66-NH2 metal-organic framework (MOF) layer and a highly aligned and interconnected branched alumina nanochannel membrane. The design leads to a continuous trilayered pore structure of large geometry gradient in the sequence from angstrom-scale to nano-scale to sub-microscale, which enables the enhanced directional ion transport, and the angstrom-sized (~6.6-7 &#197;) UiO-66-NH2 windows render the membrane with high ion selectivity. Consequently, the novel heterogeneous membrane can achieve a high-performance power of ~8 W/m2 by mixing synthetic seawater and river water. The power density can be largely upgraded to an ultrahigh ~17.1 W/m2 along with ~48.5% conversion efficiency at a 50-fold KCl gradient. This work not only presents a new membrane design approach but also showcases the great potential of employing the zirconium-based MOF channels as ion-channel-mimetic membranes for highly efficient blue energy harvesting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (XOFs) Based on N&#8943;Br+&#8943;N Bonds: Robust Organic Networks Constructed by Fragile Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic frameworks face a trade&#8208;off between the framework stability and the bonds dynamics, which necessitates the development of innovative linkages that enable stable frameworks without hindering efficient synthesis. While iodine(I)&#8208;based halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (XOFs) have been developed, constructing XOFs based on bromine(I) is desirable yet challenging due to the high sensitivity of bromine(I) species. Here, we present the inaugural construction of stable bromine(I)&#8208;bridged two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, XOF(Br)&#8208;TPy&#8208;BF4/OTf, based on sensitive [N&#8230;Br&#8230;N]+ halogen bonds. The formation of XOF(Br)&#8208;TPy&#8208;BF4/OTf was monitored by 1H NMR, XPS, IR, SEM, TEM, HR&#8208;TEM, SEAD. Their framework structures were established by the results from PXRD, theoretical simulations and SAXS. More importantly, XOF(Br)&#160;exhibited stable two&#8208;dimensional framework structures in various organic solvents and aqueous media, even over a wide pH range (pH 3&#8208;12), while the corresponding modelcompounds BrPy2BF4/OTf decomposed quickly even in the presence of minimal water. Furthermore, the influence of the counterions were investigated by replacing BF4 with OTf, which obviously improved the stability of XOF(Br). This characteristic enabled XOF(Br) to serve as efficient oxidizing reagents in aqueous environments, contrasting with the sensitivity of BrPy2BF4/OTf, which performed well only in organic media. This study opens new avenues for the development and application of multifunctional XOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Spheroidization: The Impact of Precursor Morphology on Solid&#8208;State Lithiation Process for High&#8208;Quality Ultrahigh&#8208;Nickel Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered oxides with ultrahigh nickel content are considered promising high energy cathode materials. However, their cycle stability is constrained by a series of heterogeneous structural transformations during the complex solid&#8208;state lithiation process. By in&#8208;depth investigation into the solid&#8208;state lithiation process of LiNi0.92Co0.04Mn0.04O2, it is found that the protruded parts on the surface of precursor particles tend to be surrounded by locally excessive LiOH, which promotes the formation of a rigid and dense &#160;shell during the early stage of lithiation process. The shell will hinder the diffusion of lithium and topotactic lithiation within the particles, culminating in spatially heterogeneous intermediates that can impair the electrochemical properties of the cathode material. The spheroidization of the precursor can enhance uniformity in structural evolution during solid&#8208;phase lithiation. Ultrahigh nickel cathodes derived from spherical precursors demonstrate high initial discharge specific capacity (234.2 mAh g&#8208;1, in the range of 2.7&#8208;4.3V) and capacity retention (89.3% after 200 cycles), significantly superior to the non&#8208;spherical samples. This study not only sheds light on the intricate relationship between precursor shape and structural transformation but also introduces a novel strategy for enhancing cathode performance through precursor spheroidization.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion Current Rectification Activity Induced by Boron Hydride Nanosheets to Enhance Magnesium Analgesia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low analgesic efficiency has limited magnesium used in analgesia. Here, we report boron hydride (BH) with ion current rectification activity can significantly improve the analgesic efficiency of magnesium, even higher than morphine. The synthesized injectable MgB2 composes of hexagonal boron sheets alternating with Mg2+. In pathological environment, while the intercalated Mg2+ will be exchanged by H+, the 2&#8208;dimensional borophene&#8208;analogue BH sheets will be formed to interact with the charged cations via the cation&#8208;pi interaction, synergistically leading to a sort of two&#8208;way dynamic modulation of sodium and potassium ion currents in neurons. By coordinating with the released Mg2+ to compete Ca2+, the threshold potential remarkably increases from the normal &#8208;35.9 mV to &#8208;5.9 mV, which significantly suppresses neuronal excitability, providing a potent analgesic effect. In three typical pain models&#160;, including CFA&#8208;induced inflammatory pain, PINP&#8208; or CCI&#8208;induced neuropathic pain, MgB2 demonstrates its analgesic efficiency&#160;approximately 2.23, 3.20, and 2.0 times higher than the clinical MgSO4, respectively. The development of MgB2 as analgesic drugs addresses the unmet medical need of pain relief without the risks of drug tolerance or addiction to opioids.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships of the Structural Analogs Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1 in the Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the significant attention directed toward alloy metal nanoclusters, it is crucial to explore the relationship between their structures and their performance during the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) and discover potential synergistic effects for the design of novel functional nanoclusters. However, a lack of suitable analogs makes this investigation challenging. In this study, we synthesized and characterized a&#160; pair of structural analogs, [Au8Cu1(SAdm)4(Dppm)3Cl]2+ and [Au8Ag1(SAdm)4(Dppm)3Cl]2+ (Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1, respectively). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that Au8M1 consists of a tetrahedral Au3M1 core capped by three (Dppm)Au staples, one Au2(SR)3 staple, one lone SR ligand, and a terminal Cl ligand. Ag and Cu were doped at the same site . Au8Cu1 exhibited a significantly higher CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO; ~82.2%) during eCO2RR than that of Au8Ag1 (FECO; ~33.1%). DFT demonstrated that *COOH is the key intermediate in the reduction of CO2 to CO. The formation of *COOH on Au8Cu1 is more thermodynamically stable than on Au8Ag1, and Au8Cu1 shows a smaller *CO formation energy than that on Au8Ag1, which promotes the reduction of CO2. We believe that the structural analogs Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1 offer a suitable template for the in&#8208;depth investigation of structure&#8208;property correlations at the atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of High&#8208;Capacity Sulfur Cathodes via In&#8208;Situ Polymerization of a Porous Imine&#8208;Based Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ polymerization techniques encapsulate sulfur within microporous imine polymers, addressing the sulfur&#8208;shuttle issue and boosting electrochemical performance. This innovative strategy marks a new direction for creating efficient sulfur&#8208;based cathodes in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries, essential for electronics and electric vehicles, predominantly use cathodes made from critical materials like cobalt. Sulfur&#8208;based cathodes, offering a high theoretical capacity of 1675&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and environmental advantages due to sulfur's abundance and lower toxicity, present a more sustainable alternative. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sulfur&#8208;based electrodes do not reach the theoretical capacities, mainly because conventional electrode production relies on mixing of components into weakly coordinated slurries. Consequently, sulfur&#8216;s mobility leads to battery degradation&#8212;an effect known as the &#8220;sulfur&#8208;shuttle&#8221;. This study introduces a solution by developing a microporous, covalently&#8208;bonded, imine&#8208;based polymer network grown in situ around sulfur particles on the current collector. The polymer network (i) enables selective transport of electrolyte and Li&#8208;ions through pores of defined size, and (ii) acts as a robust host to retain the active component of the electrode (sulfur species). The resulting cathode has superior rate performance from 0.1&#8197;C (1360&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) to 3&#8197;C (807&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). Demonstrating a high&#8208;performance, sustainable sulfur cathode produced via a simple one&#8208;pot process, our research underlines the potential of microporous polymers in addressing sulfur diffusion issues, paving the way for sulfur electrodes as viable alternatives to traditional metal&#8208;based cathodes.

         <title>Reversible Modulation of Plasmonic Coupling of Gold Nanoparticles Confined within Swellable Polymer Colloidal Spheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic optical modulation in response to stimuli provides exciting opportunities for designing novel sensing, actuating, and authentication devices. Here, we demonstrate that the reversible swelling and deswelling of crosslinked polymer colloidal spheres in response to pH and temperature changes can be utilized to drive the assembly and disassembly of the embedded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), inducing their plasmonic coupling and decoupling and, correspondingly, color changes. The multi&#8208;responsive colloids are created by depositing a monolayer of AuNPs on the surface of resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) nanospheres, then overcoating them with an additional RF layer, followed by a seeded growth process to enlarge the AuNPs and reduce their interparticle separation to induce significant plasmonic coupling. This configuration facilitates dynamic modulation of plasmonic coupling through the reversible swelling/deswelling of the polymer spheres in response to pH and temperature changes. The rapid and repeatable transitions between coupled and decoupled plasmonic states of AuNPs enable reversible color switching when the polymer spheres are in colloidal form or embedded in hydrogel substrates. Furthermore, leveraging the photothermal effect and stimuli&#8208;responsive plasmonic coupling of the embedded AuNPs enables the construction of hybrid hydrogel films featuring switchable anticounterfeiting patterns, showcasing the versatility and potential of this multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive plasmonic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Cascade Hydrogen Atom Transfers for Assembly of Multi&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;SCF3 and &#945;&#8208;SCF2H Cyclopentanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photocatalyzed formal (3+2) cycloaddition has been developed to construct original polysubstituted &#945;&#8208;SCF3 cyclopentanones in a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner. This building block approach leverages trifluoromethylthio alkynes and branched / linear aldehydes, as readily available reaction partners, in consecutive hydrogen atom transfers and C&#8211;C bond formations. Difluoromethylthio alkynes are also compatible subtrates. Furthermore, the potential for telescoped reaction starting from alcohols instead of aldehydes was demonstrated, as well as process automatization and scale&#8208;up under continuous microflow conditions. This prompted density functional theory calculations to support a free radical&#8208;mediated cascade hydrogen atom transfer process.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Transformation from Membrane&#8208;less Coacervates to Membranized Coacervates and Giant Vesicles: toward Multicompartmental Protocells with Complex (Membrane) Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The membranization of membrane&#8208;less coacervates paves the way for the exploitation of complex protocells with regard to structural and cell&#8208;like functional behaviors. However, the controlled transformation from membranized coacervates to vesicles remains a challenge. This can provide stable (multi)phase and (multi)compartmental architectures through the reconfiguration of coacervate droplets in the presence of (bioactive) polymers, bio(macro)molecules and/or nanoobjects. Herein, we present a continuous protocell transformation from membrane&#8208;less coacervates to membranized coacervates and, ultimately, to giant hybrid vesicles. This transformation process is orchestrated by altering the balance of non&#8208;covalent interactions through varying concentrations of an anionic terpolymer, leading to dynamic processes such as spontaneous membranization of terpolymer nanoparticles at the coacervate surface, disassembly of the coacervate phase mediated by the excess anionic charge, and the redistribution of coacervate components in membrane. The diverse protocells during the transformation course provide distinct structural features and molecular permeability. Notably, the introduction of multiphase coacervates in this continuous transformation process signifies advancements toward the creation of synthetic cells with different diffusible compartments. Our findings emphasize the highly controlled continuous structural reorganization of coacervate protocells and represents a novel step toward the development of advanced and sophisticated synthetic protocells with more precise compositions and complex (membrane) structures.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inherently chiral&#160;calix[4]arenes&#160;are&#160;an excellent structural scaffold&#160;for asymmetric synthesis, chiral recognition,&#160;sensing, and circularly polarized luminescence.

Herein, we report an efficient synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arene&#160;derivatives via cascade asymmetric cyclization and oxidation reactions. The three&#8208;component&#160;reaction features a broad substrate scope (33 examples), high efficiency (up to 90% yield), and excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;95%&#160;ee on average).

         <dc:description>A heterometallic and paramagnetic one&#8208;dimensional aligned chain in &#8211;Rh(+2)&#8211;Rh(+2)&#8211;Pt(+2)&#8211;Ni(+2)&#8211;Pt(+2)&#8211; with direct metal&#8211;metal bonds was obtained via HOMO&#8211;LUMO interactions at the &#963;* (dz2) orbital between [Rh2(O2CCH3)4] and [Pt2Ni(piam)4(NH3)4] (piam = pivalamidate).

         <title>Radical&#8208;Induced Changes in Transition Metal Interfacial Magnetic Properties: A Blatter Derivative on Polycrystalline Cobalt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we study the interface obtained by depositing a monolayer of a Blatter radical derivative on polycrystalline cobalt. By examining the occupied and unoccupied states at the interface, using soft X&#8208;ray techniques, combined with electronic structure calculations, we could simultaneously determine the electronic structure of both the molecular and ferromagnetic sides of the interface, thus obtaining a full understanding of the interfacial magnetic properties. We found that the molecule is strongly hybridized with the surface. Changes in the core level spectra reflect the modification of the molecule and the cobalt electronic structures inducing a decrease in the magnetic moment of the cobalt atoms bonded to the molecules which, in turn, lose their radical character. Our method allowed us to screen, beforehand, organic/ferromagnetic interfaces in view of their potential applications in spintronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating Anhydrous Proton Transport in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Pore Chemistry and Its Impacts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton conduction is important in both fundamental research and technological development. Here we report designed synthesis of crystalline porous covalent organic frameworks as a new platform for high&#8208;rate anhydrous proton conduction. By developing nanochannels with different topologies as proton pathways and loading neat phosphoric acid to construct robust proton carrier networks in the pores, we found that pore topology is crucial for proton conduction. Its effect on increasing proton conductivity is in an exponential mode other than linear fashion, endowing the materials with exceptional proton conductivities exceeding 10&#8211;2 S cm&#8211;1 over a broad range of temperature and a low activation energy barrier down to 0.24 eV. Remarkably, the pore size controls conduction mechanism, where mesopores promote proton conduction via a fast&#8208;hopping mechanism, while micropores follow a sluggish vehicle process. Notably, decreasing phosphoric acid loading content drastically reduces proton conductivity and greatly increases activation energy barrier, emphasizing the pivotal role of well&#8208;developed proton carrier network in proton transport. These findings and insights unveil a new general and transformative guidance for designing porous framework materials and systems for high&#8208;rate ion conduction, energy storage, and energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The&#160;high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray structures of the model protein lysozyme in the presence of the potential drug [VIVO(acetylacetonato)2] from crystals grown in 1.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M sodium acetate at pH 4.0 reveal the binding to the protein of different and unexpected mixed&#8208;valence cage&#8208;like polyoxidovanadates (POVs): [V15O36(OH2)]5&#8211;, which non&#8208;covalently interacts with the lysozyme surface, [V15O33(OH2)]+ and [V20O51(OH2)]n&#8211; (this latter based on an unusual {V18O43} cage) which covalently bind the protein.

         <title>Super Hydrous Solvated Structure of Chaotropic Ca2+ Contributes Superior Anti&#8208;Freezing Aqueous Electrolytes and Stabilizes the Zn anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The further development of aqueous zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is constrained by the high freezing points and the instability on Zn anodes. Current improvement strategies mainly focus on regulating hydrogen bond (HB) donors (H) of solvent water to disrupt HBs, while neglecting the environment of HB&#8208;acceptors (O). Herein, we propose a mechanism of chaotropic cation&#8208;regulated HB&#8208;acceptor via a &#8220;super hydrous solvated&#8221; structure. Chaotropic Ca2+ can form a solvated structure via competitively binding O atoms in H2O, effectively breaking the HBs among H2O molecules, thereby reducing the freezing point of hybrid 1 mol L&#8208;1 (M) ZnCl2 + 4 M CaCl2 electrolyte (&#8208;113.2 &#176;C). Meanwhile, the high hydratability of Ca2+ contributes to the water&#8208;poor solvated structure of Zn2+, suppressing side reactions and uneven Zn deposition. Benefiting from the anti&#8208;freezing electrolyte and high reversible Zn anode, the Zn||Pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) batteries deliver an ultrahigh capacity of 183.9 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1.0 A g&#8208;1 over 1600&#8208;time stable cycling at &#8208;60 &#176;C. This work presents a cheap and efficient aqueous electrolyte to simultaneously improve low&#8208;temperature performances and Zn stability, broadening the design concepts for antifreeze electrolytes.</dc:description>

Current improvement strategies mainly focus on regulating hydrogen bond (HB) donors (H) of solvent water to disrupt HBs, while neglecting the environment of HB-acceptors (O). Herein, we propose a mechanism of chaotropic cation-regulated HB-acceptor via a &#8220;super hydrous solvated&#8221; structure. Chaotropic Ca2+ can form a solvated structure via competitively binding O atoms in H2O, effectively breaking the HBs among H2O molecules, thereby reducing the freezing point of hybrid 1 mol L-1 (M) ZnCl2 + 4 M CaCl2 electrolyte (-113.2 &#176;C).

Benefiting from the anti-freezing electrolyte and high reversible Zn anode, the Zn||Pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone (PTO) batteries deliver an ultrahigh capacity of 183.9 mAh g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 over 1600-time stable cycling at -60 &#176;C.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the strategic design of donor&#8208;acceptor cyanoarene&#8208;based photocatalysts (PCs) aiming to augment beneficial PC degradation for halogen atom transfer (XAT)&#8208;induced dehalogenation reactions.&#160;Our investigation reveals a competitive nature between the catalytic cycle and the degradation pathway, with degradation becoming dominant, particularly for less activated alkyl halides. The degradation behavior of PCs significantly impacts the efficiency of the XAT process, leading to exploration into manipulating the degradation behavior in a desirable direction. Recognizing the variation in the nature and rate of PC degradation, as well as its influence on the reaction across the range of PC structures, we carefully engineered the PCs to develop&#160;a pre&#8208;catalyst, named 3DP&#8208;DCDP&#8208;IPN. This pre&#8208;catalyst undergoes rapid degradation into an active form, 3DP&#8208;DCDP&#8208;Me&#8208;BN, exhibited an enhanced reducing ability in its radical anion form to induce better PC regeneration and consequently effectively catalyzes the XAT reaction, even with a challenging substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Channels Based on Bottlebrush Polymers: Enhanced Ion Transport Through Polymer Topology Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic structures mimicking the transport function of natural ion channel proteins have a wide range of applications, including therapeutic treatments, separation membranes, sensing, and biotechnologies. However, the development of polymer&#8208;based artificial channels has been hampered due to the limitation on available models. In this study, we demonstrate the great potential of bottlebrush polymers as accessible and versatile molecular scaffolds for developing efficient artificial ion channels. Adopting the bottlebrush configuration enhanced ion transport activity of the channels compared to their linear analogs. Matching the structure of lipid bilayers, the bottlebrush channel with a hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic triblock architecture exhibited the highest activity among the series. Functionalized with urea groups, these channels displayed high anion selectivity. Additionally, we illustrated that the transport properties could be fine&#8208;tuned by modifying the chemistry of ion binding sites. This work not only highlights the importance of polymer topology control in channel design, but also reveals the great potential for further developing bottlebrush channels with customized features and diverse functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Catholyte for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Nonaqueous Redox Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox flow batteries (RFBs) with high energy densities are essential for efficient and sustainable long&#8208;term energy storage on a grid scale. To advance the development of nonaqueous RFBs with high energy densities, a new organic RFB system employing a molecularly engineered tetrathiafulvalene derivative ((PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF) as a high energy density catholyte was developed.&#160;When paired with a lithium metal anode, the two&#8208;electron&#8208;active (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF catholyte produced a cell voltage of 3.56 V for the first reduction and 3.92 V for the second reduction process. In cyclic voltammetry and flow cell tests, the redox chemistry exhibited excellent cycling stability. The Li|(PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF batteries, with concentrations of 0.1 M and 0.5 M, demonstrated capacity retention rates of ~94% (99.87% per cycle, 97.52% per day) and 90% (99.93% per cycle, 99.16% per day), and the average Coulombic efficiencies of 99.38% and 98.35%, respectively. The flow cell achieved a high power density of 129 mW/cm2. Furthermore, owing to the high redox potential and solubility of (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF, the flow cell attained a high operational energy density of 72 Wh/L (100 Wh/L theoretical). A 0.75 M flow cell exhibited an even higher operational energy density of 96 Wh/L (150 Wh/L theoretical).</dc:description>

         <title>Molecule Engineering of Sugar Derivatives as Electrolyte Additives for Deep&#8208;Reversible Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cycling performance of zinc&#8208;ion batteries is greatly affected by dendrite formation and side reactions on zinc anode, particularly in scenarios involving high depth of discharge (DOD) and low negative/positive capacity (N/P) ratios in full cells. Herein, drawing upon principles of host&#8208;guest interaction chemistry, we investigate the impact of molecular structure of electrolyte additives, specifically the &#8208;COOH and &#8208;OH groups, on the zinc negative electrode through molecular design. Our findings reveal that molecules containing these groups exhibit strong adsorption onto zinc anode surfaces and chelate with Zn2+, forming a H2O&#8208;poor inner Helmholtz plane. This effectively suppresses side reactions and promotes dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition of exposed (002) facets, enhancing stability and reversibility of an average coulombic efficiency of 99.89% with the introduction of Lactobionic acid (LA) additive. Under harsh conditions of 92% DOD, Zn//Zn cells exhibit stable cycling at challenging current densities of 15 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2. Even at a low N/P ratio of 1.3, Zn//NH4V4O10 full cells with LA electrolyte exhibit high&#8208;capacity retention of 73% after 300 cycles, significantly surpassing that of the blank electrolyte. Moreover, in a conversion type Zn//Br static battery with a high areal capacity (~ 5 mAh&#183;cm&#8208;2), LA electrolyte sustains an improved cycling stability of 700 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of &#8220;Structural Pin&#8221; Interactions and their Significance for the Conformational Control of Macrocyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we identify structural pins as intramolecular hydrogen bonds in macrocycles that are predominantly responsible for conformational stabilization. Characterization and structural analysis of macrocycles with NMR and molecular modelling indicates that removal of a structural pin drastically influences the conformation of the entire ring, resulting in novel states with increased conformational heterogeneity.







Abstract
While peptide macrocycles with rigidified conformations have proven to be useful in the design of chemical probes of protein targets, conformational flexibility and rapid interconversion can be equally vital for biological activity and favorable physicochemical properties. This study introduces the concept of &#8220;structural pin&#8221;, which describes a hydrogen bond that is largely responsible for stabilizing the entire macrocycle backbone conformation. Structural analysis of macrocycles using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular modelling and X&#8208;ray diffraction indicates that disruption of the structural pin can drastically influence the conformation of the entire ring, resulting in novel states with increased flexibility. This finding provides a new tool to interrogate dynamic behaviour of macrocycles. Identification of structural pins offers a useful conceptual framework to understand positions that can either be modified to give flexible structures or retained to maintain the rigidity of the scaffold.

         <title>Understanding Ligand Effects on Bielectronic Transitions: Chemo&#8208; and Electroreduction of Rhodium Bis(Diphosphine) Complexes to Low Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rhodium complexes in the &#8211;I and 0 oxidation states are of great potential interest in catalytic applications. In contrast to their rhodium +I congeners, however, the structural and electronic parameters governing their access and stability are far less understood. Herein, we investigate the two&#8208;electron reduction of a parameterized series of bis(diphosphine) Rh complexes [Rh(dxpy)2]NTf2 (x = P&#8208;substituent, y = alkanediyl bridging P atoms). Through (electro)reductions from the RhI parents, Rh&#8211;I&#160;d10&#8208;complexes were obtained and characterized spectroscopically, including 103Rh NMR data. The reductive steps convolute with structural rearrangements from square planar to tetrahedral coordination. We found that the extent of these reorganisations defines whether the first E0(RhI/0) and second E0(Rh0/&#8211;I) reduction potentials are normally ordered, leading to monoelectronic stepwise events, or inverted, giving bielectronic transitions. Reductionist approaches based on Hammett parameters or the P&#8208;Rh&#8208;P bite angles provide only partial correlations with the redox potentials. However, we identified the C&#8208;O stretch of analogue diphosphine complexes as an expedient computational parameter that enables these correlations through both electronic and geometric features, even in a predictive manner. Gaining control over two&#8208;electron reduction behaviors through rationalized ligand effects has potential impact beyond Rh complexes, for molecular and enzymatic metal sites commonly exhibiting bielectronic transitions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unsymmetric Chiral Ligands for Large Metallo&#8208;Macrocycles: Selectivity of Orientational Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature uses various chiral and unsymmetric building blocks to form substantial and complex supramolecular assemblies. In contrary, majority of organic ligands used in metallosupramolecular chemistry are symmetric and achiral. Here we extend on the group of unsymmetric chiral bile acids used as a scaffold for organic bispyridyl ligands employing the chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), epimer of previously used ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Ligands&#8217; epimerism, flexibility, and bulkiness leads to large structural differences of coordination products upon reaction with Pd(NO3)2. The UDCA&#8208;bispyridyl ligand self&#8208;assembles quantitatively into a single crown&#8208;like Pd3L6 complex, whereas the CDCA&#8208;ligand provides a mixture of coordination complexes of general formula PdnL2n, i.e., Pd2L4, Pd3L6, Pd4L8, Pd5L10, and even Pd6L12 containing impressive 120 chiral centers. The coordination products were studied by a combination of analytical methods, where the ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) provided valuable details on their structure and allowed an effective separation of m/z 1461 to individual signals according to arrival time distribution, revealing four different ions of [Pd3L6(NO3)3]3+, [Pd4L8(NO3)4]4+, [Pd5L10(NO3)5]5+, and [Pd6L12(NO3)6]6+. The structures of all complexes were modelled using DFT calculations. Finally, challenges and conclusions in determination of specific structural identity of these unsymmetric species are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Utilizing the Perfluoronaphthalene Radical Cation as a Selective Deelectronator to Access a Variety of Strongly Oxidizing Reactive Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A selective deelectronation reagent with very high potential of +2.00 (solution) / +2.41 V (solid&#8208;state) vs. Fc+/0 and based on a room temperature stable perfluoronaphthalene (naphthaleneF) radical cation salt was developed and applied. The solid&#8208;state deelectronation of commercial naph&#173;tha&#173;leneF with [NO]+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; generates [naphthaleneF]+&#8729;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (ORF = OC(CF3)3) in gram scale. Thermo&#173;chemical analysis unravels the solid&#8208;state de&#173;electronation potential of the starting [NO]+&#8208;reagent to be +2.34 V vs. Fc+/0 with [F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; counterion, but only +1.14 V vs. Fc+/0 with the small [SbF6]&#8211; ion.

The solid-state deelectronation of commercial naph&#173;tha&#173;leneF with [NO]+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; generates [naphthaleneF]+&#8729;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (ORF = OC(CF3)3) in gram scale. Thermo&#173;chemical analysis unravels the solid-state de&#173;electronation potential of the starting [NO]+-reagent to be +2.34 V vs. Fc+/0 with [F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; counterion, but only +1.14 V vs. Fc+/0 with the small [SbF6]&#8211; ion.

         <title>Kinetics of Strand Displacement Reaction with Acyclic Artificial Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reaction, one of the DNA nanotechnologies, has great potential as s biological programmable platform in the cellular environment. Various artificial nucleic acids have been developed to improve stability and affinity for biological applications. However, the lack of understanding of the kinetics of TMSD reaction among artificial nucleic acids has limited their applications. We herein systematically characterized the kinetics of TMSD reactions with acyclic xeno nucleic acids (XNAs): serinol nucleic acid (SNA), acyclic D&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (D&#8208;aTNA), and acyclic L&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (L&#8208;aTNA). We found that the strand displacement reactions by D&#8208;aTNA and by L&#8208;aTNA were highly dependent on temperature. D&#8208;aTNA and L&#8208;aTNA systems were orthogonal to each other, and chirality of the input can be switched by using SNA as an interface. We also applied TMSD reactions of XNAs to a seesaw gate amplification system which utilizes the orthogonality. This work will contribute to the developments of thermoresponsive and bioorthogonal nucleic acid circuits.</dc:description>

         <title>Anisotropic Dual S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions Mimic Natural Photosynthetic System for Boosting Photoelectric Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of heterojunctions that mimic natural photosynthetic systems holds great promise for enhancing photoelectric response. However, the limited interfacial space charge layer (SCL) often fails to provide sufficient driving force for the directional migration of inner charge carriers. Drawing inspiration from the electron transport chain (ETC) in natural photosynthesis system, we developed a novel anisotropic dual S&#8208;scheme heterojunction artificial photosynthetic system composed of Bi2O3&#8208;BiOBr&#8208;AgI for the first time, with Bi2O3 and AgI selectively distributed along the bicrystal facets of BiOBr. Compared to traditional semiconductors, the anisotropic carrier migration in BiOBr overcomes the recombination resulting from thermodynamic diffusion, thereby establishing a potential ETC for the directional migration of inner charge carriers. Importantly, this pioneering bioinspired design overcomes the limitations imposed by the limited distribution of SCL in heterojunctions, resulting in a remarkable 55&#8208;fold enhancement in photoelectric performance. Leveraging the etching of thiols on Ag&#8208;based materials, this dual S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is further employed in the construction of photoelectrochemical sensors for the detection of acetylcholinesterase and organophosphorus pesticides.</dc:description>

         <title>Polycationic Open&#8208;Shell Cyclophanes: Synthesis of Electron&#8208;Rich Chiral Macrocycles, and Redox&#8208;Dependent Electronic States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;conjugated new chiral macrocycles 1 and 2 have been accessed using the redox&#8208;active main&#8208;group carbazole and &#960;&#8208;expanded aza[7]helicene moieties. Chemical and electrochemical oxidations of these electron&#8208;rich Figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight macrocycles readily enabled the conversion to chiral polycationic open&#8208;shell cyclophanes with tunable electronic states that are rarely accessible from the all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based analogues.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated chiral nanorings with intriguing electronic structures and chiroptical properties have attracted considerable interests in synthetic chemistry and materials science. We present the design principles to access new chiral macrocycles (1 and 2) that are essentially built on the key components of main&#8208;group electron&#8208;donating carbazolyl moieties or the &#960;&#8208;expanded aza[7]helicenes. Both macrocycles show the unique molecular conformations with a (quasi) figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight topology as a result of the conjugation patterns of 2,2&#8217;,7,7&#8217;&#8208;spirobifluorenyl in 1 and triarylamine&#8208;coupled aza[7]helicene&#8208;based building blocks in 2. This electronic nature of redox&#8208;active, carbazole&#8208;rich backbones enabled these macrocycles to be readily oxidized chemically and electrochemically, leading to the sequential production of a series of positively charged polycationic open&#8208;shell cyclophanes. Their redox&#8208;dependent electronic states of the resulting multispin polyradicals have been characterized by VT&#8208;ESR, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR absorption and spectroelectrochemical measurements. The singlet (&#916;ES&#8208;T=&#8722;1.29&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and a nearly degenerate singlet&#8208;triplet ground state (&#916;ES&#8722;T(calcd)=&#8722;0.15&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and &#916;ES&#8722;T(exp)=0.01&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) were proved for diradical dications 12+2&#8901; and 22+2&#8901;, respectively. Our work provides an experimental proof for the construction of electron&#8208;donating new chiral nanorings, and more importantly for highly charged polyradicals with potential applications in chirospintronics and organic conductors.

         <title>Domain Swapping in Abiotic Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abiotic foldamers have been shown to reproduce some of the patterns of protein folding in organic solvents, including cooperative folding transition and the accommodation of conformational strain within tertiary folds. Here, we show that a foldamer initially designed to form a quaternary structure in fact leads to a domain&#8208;swapped dimer, another pattern well&#8208;known in proteins.







Abstract
Foldamer sequences that adopt tertiary helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix folds mediated by helix&#8208;helix hydrogen bonding in organic solvents have been previously reported. In an attempt to create genuine abiotic quaternary structures, i.e. assemblies of tertiary structures, new sequences were prepared that possess additional hydrogen bond donors at positions that may promote an association between the tertiary folds. However, a solid state structure and extensive solution state investigations by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Circular Dichroism (CD) show that, instead of forming a quaternary structure, the tertiary folds assemble into stable domain&#8208;swapped dimer motifs. Domain swapping entails a complete reorganization of the arrays of hydrogen bonds and changes in relative helix orientation and handedness that can all be rationalized.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer Enabled Catalytic Enantioselective Coupling to Chiral Trifluoromethylated Alkynes via Dual Nickel and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With halogen&#8208;atom transfer as an effective tool, a novel catalytic enantioselective protocol generating chiral trifluoromethylated alkynes with high yields and selectivities has been established. It uses a cooperative photoredox and nickel catalysis system, and expands the nickel&#8208;catalysed asymmetric reductive cross&#8208;coupling of organohalides from the traditional single&#8208;electron transfer to halogen&#8208;atom transfer.







Abstract
With halogen&#8208;atom transfer as an effective tool, a novel catalytic enantioselective protocol to generate chiral trifluoromethylated alkynes has been established by a cooperative photoredox and nickel catalysis system, providing a straightforward and modular route to access this type of product in good yields and enantioselectivities. The halogen&#8208;atom transfer process is essential for the reaction and this novel strategy offers another promising way to utilize alkyl halides with highly negative reduction potentials. It firstly expands nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive cross&#8208;couplings of organohalides from the traditional single&#8208;electron transfer to halogen&#8208;atom transfer.

The halogen-atom transfer process is essential for the reaction and this novel strategy offers another promising way to utilize alkyl halides with highly negative reduction potentials. It firstly expands nickel-catalyzed asymmetric reductive cross-couplings of organohalides from the traditional single-electron transfer to halogen-atom transfer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
