         <title>Be&#8208;Be &#960; bonding and predicted superconductivity in MBe2 (M=Zr, Hf)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Beryllium, an s&#8208;block element, forms an aromatic network of delocalized Be&#8208;Be &#960; bonds in alloys ZrBe2 and HfBe2. This gives rise to a structure that fits description as stacked [Be2]4&#8208; layers with tetravalent cations in between. The [Be2]4&#8208; sublattice is isoelectronic and isostructural to graphite, as well as the [B]&#8208;2 sublattice in MgB2, and it bears identical manifestations of &#960; bonding in its electronic band structure. These come in the form of degeneracies at K and H in the Brillouin zone, separated in energy as the result of interlayer orbital interactions. Zr and Hf use their valence d orbitals to form bonds with the layers, leading to nearly identical band structures. Like MgB2, ZrBe2 and HfBe2 are computed to be phonon&#8208;mediated superconductors at ambient pressures, with respective critical temperatures of 11.4 K and 8.8 K. The coupling strength between phonons and free electrons is very similar, so that the difference in critical temperatures is controlled by the mass of constituent interlayer ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Porous Aromatic Framework Membranes with Modifiable Sites for Optimized Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous microporous membranes are widely studied for gas separation, due to their low energy premium and strong molecular specificity. Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) with their exceptional stability and structural flexibility are suited to a wide range of separations. Main&#8208;stream PAF&#8208;based membranes are usually prepared with polymeric matrices, but their discrete entities and boundary defects weaken their selectivity and permeability. The synthesis of continuous PAF membranes is still a major challenge because PAFs are insoluble. Herein, we successfully synthesized a continuous PAF membrane for gas separation. Both pore size and chemistry of the PAF membrane were modified by ion&#8208;exchange, resulting in good selectivity and permeance for the gas mixtures H  2  /N  2  and CO  2  /N  2  . The membrane with Br  &#8208;  as a counter ion in the framework exhibited a H  2  /N  2  selectivity of 72.7 with a H  2  permeance of 51844 gas permeation units (GPU). When the counter ions were replaced by BF  4  &#8208;  , the membrane showed a CO  2  permeance of 23058 GPU, and an optimized CO  2  /N  2  selectivity of 60.0. Our results show that continuous PAF membranes with modifiable pores are promising for various gas separation situations.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly ethylene&#8208;selective electrocatalytic CO2 reduction enabled by isolated Cu&#8208;S motifs in metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;based precatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;based material is an efficient electrocatalyst for CO2 conversion to C2+ products, most of which will reconstruct to in&#8208;situ regenerate active species. It is a challenge to precisely design precatalyst to obtain active sites for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, we develop a local sulfur doping strategy over the Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks precatalyst that disperses stable Cu&#8208;S motif in the framework of HKUST&#8208;1 (S&#8208;HKUST&#8208;1). The precatalyst exhibits a high ethylene selectivity in H&#8208;type cell with maximum faradaic efficiency (FE) of 60.0%, and delivers a current density of 400 mA cm&#8208;2 with ethylene FE to 57.2% in a flow cell. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption results demonstrate that Cu&#948;+ species stabilized by Cu&#8208;S motif exist in S&#8208;HKUST&#8208;1 during CO2RR. Density functional theory calculations indicate the partially oxidized Cu&#948;+ at Cu/CuxSy interface is favorable for *CO intermediate coupling due to the modest distance of coupling sites and optimized adsorption energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Responsive Interfacial Assemblies Based on Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge transfer (CT) interactions have been widely used to construct supramolecular systems, such as functional nanostructures and gels. However, to date, there is no report on the generation of CT complexes at the liquid&#8208;liquid interface. Here, by using an electron&#8208;deficient acceptor dissolved in water and an electron&#8208;rich donor dissolved in oil, we present the in&#8208;situ formation and assembly of CT complex surfactants (CTCSs) at the oil&#8208;water interface. With time, CTCSs can assemble into higher ordered nanofilms with exceptional mechanical properties, allowing the stabilization of liquids and, offering the possibility to structure liquids into nonequilibrium shapes. Moreover, due to the redox&#8208;responsiveness of the electron&#8208;deficient acceptor, the association and dissociation of CTCSs can be reversibly manipulated in a redox process, leading to the switchable assembly and disassembly of the resultant constructs.</dc:description>

         <title>Labile photo&#8208;induced free radical in alpha&#8208;ketoglutaric acid: a universal endogenous polarizing agent for in vivo hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperpolarized (HP)  13  C magnetic resonance enables non&#8208;invasive probing of metabolism in vivo. To date, only  13  C&#8208;molecules hyperpolarized with persistent trityl radicals have been injected in humans. We show here that the free radical photo&#8208;induced in alpha&#8208;ketoglutaric acid (&#945;&#8208;KG) can be used to hyperpolarize photo&#8208;inactive  13  C&#8208;molecules such as [1&#8208;  13  C]lactate. &#945;&#8208;KG is an endogenous molecule with an exceptionally high radical yield under photo&#8208;irradiation, up to 50%, and its breakdown product, succinic acid, is also endogenous. This radical precursor therefore exhibits an excellent safety profile for translation to human studies. The labile nature of the radical means that no filtration is required prior to injection while also offering the opportunity to extend the  13  C relaxation time in frozen HP  13  C&#8208;molecules for storage and transport. The potential for in vivo metabolic studies is demonstrated in the rat liver following the injection of a physiological dose of HP [1&#8208;  13  C]lactate.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiroptical Switching and Quantitative Chirality Sensing with (Pseudo)halogenated Quinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report that (pseudo)halogenated quinones react with chiral amines, amino alcohols and amino acids toward push&#8208;pull conjugates with distinctive chiroptical properties amenable to new sensing and switching applications. Strong circular dichroism (CD) signals are induced that allow determination of the absolute configuration and enantiomeric ratio (er) of the chiral target molecules. At the same time, UV changes are observed that can be directly correlated to the total concentration of both enantiomers. The sensing reactions are fast, proceed without by&#8208;product formation at room temperature, tolerate a variety of solvents, and are insensitive to moisture. A work&#8208;up free chirality sensing protocol that is broadly applicable as demonstrated with more than thirty aliphatic and aromatic target compounds, operationally simple while much faster&#160;than traditional chromatographic methods was developed. The absolute error margin of the simultaneous concentration and er analysis is within a few percent which is demonstrated with 20 nonracemic samples. In addition, the chiroptically active push&#8208;pull conjugates can serve as redox switches between two reversibly interconverting states. The addition of sodium borohydride generates a hydroquinone which is quantitatively re&#8208;oxidized to the original quinone upon exposure to air. The corresponding redox couple has remarkably different UV and CD signatures and the switching coincides with a stark colorimetric change. This chiroptical quinone/hydroquinone redox system combines attractive features such as simple set&#8208;up, use of inexpensive chemicals, short response time, thermal and photochemical stability, and it shows no sign of signal decay after three redox cycles. A conceptually new approach that is based on integrated chiroptical sensing and redox switching enables on&#8208;the&#8208;fly spectral deconvolution of otherwise overlapping CD spectra and is used for unprecedented er analysis of challenging samples containing constitutional isomers.</dc:description>

Strong circular dichroism (CD) signals are induced that allow determination of the absolute configuration and enantiomeric ratio (er) of the chiral target molecules. At the same time, UV changes are observed that can be directly correlated to the total concentration of both enantiomers. The sensing reactions are fast, proceed without by-product formation at room temperature, tolerate a variety of solvents, and are insensitive to moisture. A work-up free chirality sensing protocol that is broadly applicable as demonstrated with more than thirty aliphatic and aromatic target compounds, operationally simple while much faster&#160;than traditional chromatographic methods was developed. The absolute error margin of the simultaneous concentration and er analysis is within a few percent which is demonstrated with 20 nonracemic samples. In addition, the chiroptically active push-pull conjugates can serve as redox switches between two reversibly interconverting states. The addition of sodium borohydride generates a hydroquinone which is quantitatively re-oxidized to the original quinone upon exposure to air. The corresponding redox couple has remarkably different UV and CD signatures and the switching coincides with a stark colorimetric change. This chiroptical quinone/hydroquinone redox system combines attractive features such as simple set-up, use of inexpensive chemicals, short response time, thermal and photochemical stability, and it shows no sign of signal decay after three redox cycles. A conceptually new approach that is based on integrated chiroptical sensing and redox switching enables on-the-fly spectral deconvolution of otherwise overlapping CD spectra and is used for unprecedented er analysis of challenging samples containing constitutional isomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Access to Axially Chiral Olefins via C&#8208;H Bond Activation and Directing Group Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral open&#8208;chain olefins represent an underexplored class of chiral platform. In this report, two classes of tetrasubstituted axially chiral acyclic olefins have been accessed in excellent enantioselectivity and regioselectivity via C&#8208;H activation of (hetero)arenes assisted by a migratable directing group en route to coupling with sterically hindered alkynes. The coupling of indoles bearing an N&#8208;aminocarbonyl directing group afforded C&#8208;N axially chiral acrylamides with assistance of a racemic zinc carboxylate additive. DFT studies suggest a &#946;&#8208;nitrogen elimination&#8208;reinsertion pathway for the directing group migration. Meanwhile, the employment of N&#8208;phenoxycarboxamide delivered C&#8208;C axially chiral enamides via migration of the oxidizing directing group. Experimental studies suggest that in both cases the (hetero)arene substrate adopts a well&#8208;defined orientation during the C&#8208;H activation, which in turn determines the disposition of alkyne in migratory insertion. Synthetic applications of representative chiral olefins have been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Approach to the Antifungal Sphingofungin Family: Concise Total Synthesis of Sphingofungin A and C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sphingofungins are fungal natural products known to inhibit the biosynthesis of sphingolipids which play pivotal roles in various cell functions. Here, we report a short and flexible synthetic approach towards the sphingofungin family. Key step of the synthesis was a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of chiral sulfinyl imines with a functionalized tartaric acid derivative, which yielded the core motive of sphingofungins carrying four consecutive stereocenters and a terminal double bond. Subsequent metathesis reaction allowed for the introduction of different side chains of choice resulting in a total of eight sphingofungins, including for the first time sphingofungin C (eight steps from commercially available protected tartaric acid with an overall yield of 6%) and sphingofungin A (ten steps). All newly synthesized derivatives were tested for their antifungal, cell proliferative and antiparasitic activity unraveling their structure&#8208;activity relations.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetraaryldiborane(4) Can Emit Dual Fluorescence Responding to the Structural Change around the B&#8211;B Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the successful synthesis of tetramesityldiborane(4) (Mes  4  B  2  ) through the reductive coupling of a dimesitylborinium ion. Due to the steric protection conferred by the mesityl groups, Mes  4  B  2  shows exceptional chemical stability and remains intact in water. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that Mes  4  B  2  has an orthogonal geometry, where the B&#8211;B center is completely hidden by the mesityl groups. Remarkably, Mes  4  B  2  emits dual fluorescence at 460 and 620 nm, both in solution and in the solid state. Theoretical calculations showed that Mes  4  B  2  in the excited S  1  state adopts a twisted or planar geometry, which is responsible for the shorter&#8208; or longer&#8208;wavelength fluorescence, respectively. The intensity ratio of the dual fluorescence is sensitive to the viscosity of the medium, which suggests that Mes  4  B  2  has potential as a ratiometric viscosity sensor.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Side&#8208;Chain&#8208;Dependent Ordering Transition of Highly Crystalline Double&#8208;Cable Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When switching the alky linkers from C12H24 to C16H32 in double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers, perylene bisimide side units exhibited order phase transition from disordered structures to ordered H&#8208;aggregation, which is strongly correlated to the photovoltaic performance in single&#8208;component organic solar cells.







Abstract
We developed a series of highly crystalline double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers for application in single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). These polymers contain conjugated backbones as electron donor and pendant perylene bisimide units (PBIs) as electron acceptor. PBIs are connected to the backbone via alkyl units varying from hexyl (C6H12) to eicosyl (C20H40) as flexible linkers. For double&#8208;cable polymers with short linkers, the PBIs tend to stack in a head&#8208;to&#8208;head fashion, resulting in large d&#8208;spacings (e.g. 64&#8197;&#197; for the polymer P12 with C12H24 linker) along the lamellar stacking direction. When the length of the linker groups is longer than a certain length, the PBIs instead adopt a more ordered packing likely via H&#8208;aggregation, resulting in short d&#8208;spacings (e.g. 50&#8197;&#197; for the polymer P16 with C16H32 linker). This work highlights the importance of linker length on the molecular packing of the acceptor units and the influences on the photovoltaic performance of SCOSCs.

         <title>Stepwise Generation of Mono&#8208;, Di&#8208;, and Triply&#8208;Reduced Warped Nanographenes: Charge&#8208;Dependent Aromaticity, Surface Nonequivalence, Swing Distortion, and Metal Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise chemical reduction of a molecular warped nanographene (WNG, 1) with Cs metal affords the mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and triply&#8208;reduced nanosized carbanions. In&#8208;depth X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and comprehensive theoretical investigations of this series of negatively charged nanographenes reveal a very complex response and core flexibility upon multi&#8208;electron charging.







Abstract
The stepwise chemical reduction of a molecular warped nanographene (WNG) having a negatively curved &#960;&#8208;surface and defined C80H30 composition with Cs metal used as the reducing and complexing agent allowed the isolation of three different reduced states with one, two, and three electrons added to its &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. This provided a unique series of nanosized carbanions with increasing negative charge for in&#8208;depth structural analysis of consequences of controlled electron charging of non&#8208;planar nanographenes, using X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational tools. The 3D molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps identified the negative charge localization at the central part of the WNG surface where selective coordination of Cs+ ions is confirmed crystallographically. In&#8208;depth theoretical investigation revealed a complex response of the WNG to the stepwise electron acquisition. The extended and contorted &#960;&#8208;surface of the WNG undergoes subtle swinging distortions that are accompanied by notable changes in the electronic structure and site&#8208;dependent aromaticity of the resulting carbanions.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Strain Phosphate Cathode for High&#8208;Rate and Ultralong Cycle&#8208;Life Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;strain phosphate cathode material K3(VO)(HV2O3)(PO4)2(HPO4) (KVP) nanorulers is synthesized by a facile solvothermal approach. The KVP nanorulers manifest high discharge voltage, superior rate capability, and ultralong cyclic life as a cathode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). This work would provide guidance to exploit high&#8208;performance PIB cathode materials.







Abstract
Most potassium&#8208;ion battery (PIB) cathode materials have deficient structural stability because of the huge radius of potassium ion, leading to inferior cycling performance. We report the controllable synthesis of a novel low&#8208;strain phosphate material K3(VO)(HV2O3)(PO4)2(HPO4) (denoted KVP) nanorulers as an efficient cathode for PIBs. The as&#8208;synthesized KVP nanoruler cathode exhibits an initial reversible capacity of 80.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 20&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a large average working potential of 4.11&#8197;V. It also manifests an excellent rate property of 54.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a high capacity preservation of 92.1&#8201;% over 2500&#8197;cycles. The outstanding potassium storage capability of KVP nanoruler cathode originates from a low&#8208;strain K+ uptake/removal mechanism, inherent semiconductor characteristic, and small K+ migration energy barrier. The high energy density and prolonged cyclic stability of KVP nanorulers//polyaniline&#8208;intercalated layered titanate full battery verifies the superiority of KVP nanoruler cathode in PIBs.

         <title>Reactions of a Dilithiomethane with CO and N2O: An Avenue to an Anionic Ketene and a Hexafunctionalized Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dianion [(Ph2P(S))2CLi2(THF)]2 1 reacts with CO affording C&#8722;C bond formation and Ph2P(S)&#8208;fragment migration. Subsequent reaction with N2O cleaves a P&#8722;C bond generating an anionic ketene&#8208;derivative which cyclotrimerizes to give the hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivative, [Ph2P(S)COLi(THF)2]3 6 regioselectively. The experimental observations are rationalized by a detailed theoretical study of the reaction mechanism by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT methods.







Abstract
Synthesis of value&#8208;added products from simple C1 feedstocks is an attractive alternative avenue to traditional fossil fuels. Hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives are highly useful molecules but are often challenging to prepare. Herein, we report that the lithium complex [(Ph2P(S))2CLi2(THF)]2 1 reacts with CO lead to C&#8722;C bond formation and migration of a Ph2P(S)&#8208;fragment affording 2. Subsequent reaction with N2O results in oxidative cleavage of a P&#8722;C bond affording [Ph2P(S)OLi(THF)2]2 4 and the anionic ketene&#8208;derivative Ph2P(S)CCOLi(THF)2 5. Heating 5 prompts cyclotrimerization giving the hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivative [Ph2P(S)CCOLi(THF)2]3 6 regioselectively. This transition metal&#8208;free protocol to a hexa&#8208;substituted benzene is viable on a gram scale and permits the incorporation of 13C labels. The mechanisms of these reactions are detailed via extensive DFT computations.

         <title>Block Copolymers Based on Ethylene and Methacrylates Using a Combination of Catalytic Chain Transfer Polymerisation (CCTP) and Radical Polymerisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic chain transfer polymerisation was used to produce methacrylic macromonomers. Those were involved in a simple radical polymerisation of ethylene to form block copolymers featuring a polyethylene segment and various polymethacrylic segments.







Abstract
Two scalable polymerisation methods are used in combination for the synthesis of ethylene and methacrylate block copolymers. &#969;&#8208;Unsaturated methacrylic oligomers (MMAn) produced by catalytic chain transfer (co)polymerisation (CCTP) of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA) are used as reagents in the radical polymerisation of ethylene (E) in dimethyl carbonate solvent under relatively mild conditions (80&#8197;bar, 70&#8201;&#176;C). Kinetic measurements and analyses of the produced copolymers by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques indicate that MMAn is involved in a degradative chain transfer process resulting in the formation of (MMA)n&#8208;b&#8208;PE block copolymers. Molecular modelling performed by DFT supports the overall reactivity scheme and observed selectivities. The effect of MMAn molar mass and composition is also studied. The block copolymers were characterised by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and their bulk behaviour studied by SAXS/WAXS analysis.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Selective Photolysis of Phosphonium Iodide Salts for Monofluoromethylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and selective synthesis of fluoromethylated alkenes, heterocycles, enamines and heteroarenes by using the readily available and bench&#8208;stable fluoromethylphosphonium iodide salts is described. Key to this privileged transformation is the formation of a photoactive charge&#8208;transfer complex involving the &#963;&#8208;hole effect of phosphonium salts.







Abstract
The sigma (&#963;)&#8208;hole effect has emerged as a promising tool to construct novel architectures endowed with new properties. A simple yet effective strategy for the generation of monofluoromethyl radicals is a continuing challenge within the synthetic community. Fluoromethylphosphonium salts are easily available, air&#8208; and thermally stable, as well as simple&#8208;to&#8208;handle. Herein, we report the ability of the &#963;&#8208;hole effect to facilitate the visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered photolysis of phosphonium iodide salts, a charge&#8208;transfer complex, selectively giving fluoromethyl radicals. The usefulness and versatility of this new protocol are demonstrated through the mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trifluoromethylation of a variety of alkenes.

         <title>Elimination of Grain Boundary Defects in Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework ZIF&#8208;95 Membrane via Solvent&#8208;Free Secondary Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free secondary growth is developed for facile synthesis of highly oriented and well&#8208;intergrown ZIF&#8208;95 membranes. The solvent&#8208;free secondary growth is not only helpful to control the membrane microstructure and thickness, but also reduce solvent&#8208;induced intercrystalline defects, leading to a significant enhancement of the H2 permselectivity for the separation of hydrogen from larger gas molecules compared to solvothermal synthesis.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework membranes are usually prepared by in situ or secondary growth in a solution/hydrogel. The use of organic solvents may cause safety and environmental problems and produce solvent&#8208;induced defects. Here, highly oriented and permselective ZIF&#8208;95 membranes are prepared for the first time via a solvent&#8208;free secondary growth method. The solvent&#8208;free growth is not only helpful to control the membrane microstructure and thickness, but also to reduce the intercrystalline defects. In case of solvent&#8208;free growth, a perfectly oriented structure leads to an outstanding reduction of intercrystalline defects and transport resistances. For the separation of equimolar binary gas mixtures by using the highly oriented ZIF&#8208;95 membrane at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;bar, the mixture separation factors of H2/CO2 and H2/CH4 are 184 and 140, respectively, with H2 permeance of over 1.9&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;Pa&#8722;1 which are much higher than those of the randomly oriented ZIF&#8208;95 membrane.

         <title>Phenylimino Indolinone: A Green&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive T&#8208;Type Photoswitch Exhibiting Negative Photochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive T&#8208;type photoswitches with negative photochromism are rare and interesting candidates for a wide range of applications. Here, we describe the computer&#8208;assisted rational design of phenylimino indolinone (PIO) and its characterization in the ground and excited state using the full toolbox of physical organic chemistry.







Abstract
Imines are photoaddressable motifs useful in the development of new generations of molecular switches, but their operation with low&#8208;energy photons and control over isomer stability remain challenging. Based on a computational design, we developed phenylimino indolinone (PIO), a green&#8208;light&#8208;addressable T&#8208;type photoswitch showing negative photochromism. The isomerization behavior of this photoactuator of the iminothioindoxyl (ITI) class was studied using time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies on time scales from femtoseconds to the steady state and by quantum&#8208;chemical analyses. The understanding of the isomerization properties and substituent effects governing these photoswitches opens new avenues for the development of novel T&#8208;type visible&#8208;light&#8208;addressable photoactuators based on C=N bonds.

         <title>Dual&#8208;targeting Circular Aptamer Strategy Enabled Recognition of Different Leukemia Cells with Enhanced Binding Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, the broad use of monovalent aptamers in oncology faces challenges, including insufficient recognition and internalization caused by finite unitary receptors, as well as confined recognition spectrum. Herein, we describe the development of a dual&#8208;targeting circular aptamer (DTCA) that can recognize two different biomarkers on living cells to augment aptamer&#8208;receptor interactions, thus allowing the enhanced recognition event to occur. This improvement not only boosts binding and internalization abilities, but also expands the recognition spectrum for different leukemia cells. Moreover, the stability of DTCA in serum can be significantly improved by an enzyme&#8208;promoted terminal ligation strategy. The chemical incorporation of 5&#8208;fluorodeoxyuridine into DTCA resulted in a pharmaceutically functional aptamer that exhibited excellent selectivity, as demonstrated by its high cytotoxicity against target cancer cells, but not to normal cells. The superiority of our newly developed strategy was further highlighted by its precise tumor imaging capability.</dc:description>

Aryl sulfonyl fluorides, typically inert to transition metal catalysis, undergo a Pd&#8208;catalyzed desulfonative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling. The reaction can occur without added base and turns the &#8722;SO2F group into a divergent handle for C&#8722;C or S&#8722;Nu coupling.







Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides have emerged as powerful &#8220;click&#8221; electrophiles to access sulfonylated derivatives. Yet, they are relatively inert towards C&#8722;C bond forming transformations, notably under transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Here, we describe conditions under which aryl sulfonyl fluorides act as electrophiles for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. This desulfonative cross&#8208;coupling occurs selectively in the absence of base and, unusually, even in the presence of strong acids. Divergent one&#8208;step syntheses of two analogues of bioactive compounds showcase the expanded reactivity of sulfonyl fluorides to encompass both S&#8722;Nu and C&#8722;C bond formation. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations suggest oxidative addition occurs at the C&#8722;S bond followed by desulfonation to form a Pd&#8208;F intermediate that facilitates transmetalation.

         <title>Stabilization of the Elusive Antimony(I) Cation and Its Coordination Complexes with Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elusive SbI cation has been stabilized by the 5,6&#8208;bis(diisopropylphosphino)acenaphthene ligand (see structure). The bis(phosphine) not only acts as a supporting ligand, but also enables the unique two&#8208;electron reduction of the SbIII precursor in the presence of trimethylsilyl triflate, leading to SbI cation. The strategically introduced nucleophilicity at the SbI site enabled the first examples of its coordination to transition metals.







Abstract
Upon stabilization by 5,6&#8208;bis(diisopropylphosphino)acenaphthene to form compound 1, the fugitive antimony (I) cation exhibited nucleophilic behavior towards coinage metals. Compound 1 was strategically synthesized at room temperature from SbCl3, the bis(phosphine), and trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate taken in a 1:2:3 ratio, whereby the bis(phosphine) plays the dual role of a reductant and a supporting ligand. The generation of 1 involves two&#8208;electron oxidation of the ligand to form a P&#8722;P bonded diphosphonium dication. Compound 1 was separated from this dication to give both products in pure form in moderate yields. Despite the overall positive charge, the SbI site in 1 was found to bind to metal centers, forming complexes with AuI, AgI and CuI. Compound 1 reduced CuII to CuI and formed a coordination complex with the resulting CuI species. The effects of the electron&#8208;rich bis(phosphine) and the constrained peri geometry in stabilizing and enhancing the nucleophilicity of 1 have been rationalized through computational studies.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity of a Cyapho&#8208;Cyanamide Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the step&#8208;wise synthesis of the novel cyapho&#8208;cyanamide ion, [N(CN)(CP)]&#8722;, obtained by the reaction of sodium phosphanide, Na(PH2), with dimethyl N&#8208;cyanocarbonimidate, (MeO)2C=N(CN). Preliminary reactions of the ion with electrophiles reveal the cyclisation reactions are available on functionalisation.







Abstract
We describe a facile synthesis of the cyapho&#8208;cyanamide salt [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][N(CN)(CP)] from reaction of [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][PH2] (18&#8208;crown&#8208;6=1,4,7,10,13,16&#8208;hexaoxacyclooctadecane) with dimethyl N&#8208;cyanocarbonimidate, (MeO)2C=N(CN). The reaction proceeds with elimination of two equivalents of methanol. Careful tuning of the reaction conditions allowed for the isolation and characterization of the N&#8208;cyano(carboximidate)phosphide intermediate [HP{C(OMe)N(CN)}]&#8722;. Due to the adverse effects of methanol in these reaction mixtures, a bulk scale synthesis of [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][N(CN)(CP)] could be achieved by addition of a base (LiHMDS) to neutralize the resulting alcohol. Further reactivity studies of this anion reveal that functionalization at the phosphorus atom is viable to yield a new family of cyanide&#8208;functionalised phosphorus heterocycles.

         <title>Probing Water State during Lipidic Mesophases Phase Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We study the phase transitions from cubic to reverse hexagonal phase in lipidic mesophase at molecular level. The dynamics of both water and lipids, as well as the hydrogen bond network of confined water were monitored during the phase transition. The results demonstrate clear dynamical difference between bound and interstitial water in both phases.







Abstract
We investigate the static and dynamic states of water network during the phase transitions from double gyroid (
) to double diamond (
) bicontinuous cubic phases and from the latter to the reverse hexagonal (HII) phase in monolinolein based lipidic mesophases by combining FTIR and broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS). In both cubic(s) and HII phase, two dynamically different fractions of water are detected and attributed to bound and interstitial free water. The dynamics of the two water fractions are all slower than bulk water due to the hydrogen&#8208;bonds between water molecules and the lipid's polar headgroups and to nanoconfinement. Both FTIR and BDS results suggest that a larger fraction of water is hydrogen&#8208;bonded to the headgroup of lipids in the HII phase at higher temperature than in the cubic phase at lower temperature via H&#8208;bonds, which is different from the common expectation that the number of H&#8208;bonds should decrease with increase of temperature. These findings are rationalized by considering the topological ratio of interface/volume of the two mesophases.

         <title>Deciphering and Suppressing Over&#8208;Oxidized Nitrogen in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Urea Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic investigation of the nitrogen network during the nickel&#8208;catalyzed urea oxidation reaction was carefully performed. It revealed a dominant NO2&#8722; production rather than innocuous N2 present on various nickel&#8208;based catalysts. Accordingly, polymer&#8208;surface modification was put forward to increase the efficiency of harmless N2 products.







Abstract
Urea electrolysis is a prospective technology for simultaneous H2 production and nitrogen suppression in the process of water being used for energy production. Its sustainability is currently founded on innocuous N2 products; however, we discovered that prevalent nickel&#8208;based catalysts could generally over&#8208;oxidize urea into NO2&#8722; products with &#8776;80&#8201;% Faradaic efficiencies, posing potential secondary hazards to the environment. Trace amounts of over&#8208;oxidized NO3&#8722; and N2O were also detected. Using 15N isotopes and urea analogues, we derived a nitrogen&#8208;fate network involving a NO2&#8722;&#8208;formation pathway via OH&#8722;&#8208;assisted C&#8722;N cleavage and two N2&#8208;formation pathways via intra&#8208; and intermolecular coupling. DFT calculations confirmed that C&#8722;N cleavage is energetically more favorable. Inspired by the mechanism, a polyaniline&#8208;coating strategy was developed to locally enrich urea for increasing N2 production by a factor of two. These findings provide complementary insights into the nitrogen fate in water&#8211;energy nexus systems.

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Fluorescent Polymeric Particles with Tunable White Light Emission Based on Aggregation Microenvironment Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8211;shell fluorescent polymeric particle were (CS&#8208;FPPs) constructed based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) via the stepwise self&#8208;stabilized precipitation (2SP) polymerization, and white light emission of CS&#8208;FPPs was achieved with the CIE1931 coordinate of (0.33, 0.34), which could be simply but effectively tuned by manipulating the aggregation microenvironment of the AIEgens located.







Abstract
White&#8208;light emitting polymers (WLEPs) based on aggregation microenvironment&#8208;sensitive aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) have aroused great interest in lighting and optoelectronic devices. Herein, we developed a novel strategy to construct WLEP particles via a stepwise self&#8208;stabilized precipitation polymerization of two emission&#8208;complementary AIEgens under core&#8211;shell engineering, where the AIE characteristics and FRET process of core&#8211;shell fluorescent polymeric particles (CS&#8208;FPPs) could be modulated by altering aggregation microenvironment under swelling and shrinking of polymers, facilitating the tunable white light emission of CS&#8208;FPPs. Furthermore, such tuning could be fast realized in the solid state, thus demonstrating the potential in anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work proved the significance of aggregation microenvironment on emission of luminogens, guiding the development of high&#8208;efficiency emission&#8208;tunable materials.

         <title>Moderate Surface Segregation Promotes Selective Ethanol Production in CO2 Hydrogenation Reaction over CoCu Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobalt&#8208;copper (CoCu) catalyst is known to have potential industrial application to catalyze CO/CO  2  hydrogenation reactions. And CoCu alloy has been elucidated as major active phase during reactions. However, due to the elemental surface segregation and even dealloying phenomena, the actual surface morphology of CoCu alloy is still unclear. Herein, combining theory and experiment, this paper describes the dual effect of surface segregation and varied CO coverage over CoCu(111) surface on the reactivity in CO  2  hydrogenation reactions. The wrestling relation between C&#8208;O bond scission and further hydrogenation of intermediate *CH  2  O was discovered as the key step to promote ethanol production. The theoretical investigation suggests that moderate Co segregation provides a suitable surface Co ensemble with lateral interactions of co&#8208;adsorbed *CO, leading to promoted selectivity to ethanol, in agreement with theory&#8208;inspired experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrocycle Dynamics in a Branched [8]Catenane Controlled by Three Different Stimuli in Three Different Regions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A branched [8]catenane from an efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis (72% HPLC yield, 59% isolated yield) featuring the simultaneous use of three kinds of templates and cucurbit[6]uril&#8208;mediated azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CBAAC) for ring&#8208;closing is reported. Design and assembly of the [8]catenane precursors are unexpectedly complex that can involve cooperating, competing and non&#8208;influencing interactions. Due to the branched structure, dynamics of the [8]catenane can be modulated in different extent by rigidifying/loosening the mechanical bonds at different regions by using solvent polarity, acid&#8208;base and metal ions as the stimuli. This work not only highlights the importance of understanding the delicate interplay of the weak and non&#8208;obvious supramolecular interactions in the synthesis of high&#8208;order [n]catenane, but also demonstrates a complex control of dynamics and flexibility for exploiting [n]catenanes applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Dye&#8208;Triplet&#8208;Sensitized Upconversion Emission Through Heavy Atom Effect in CsLu2F7:Yb/Er Nanoprobes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide (Ln  3+  )&#8208;doped upconversion (UC) nanoprobes, which have drawn extensive attentions for various bioapplications, usually suffer from small absorption cross&#8208;section and weak luminescence intensity of Ln  3+&#160;  ions. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of a new class of Ln  3+  &#8208;doped UC nanoprobes based on CsLu  2  F  7  :Yb/Er nanocrystals (NCs), which can effectively increase the intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency from singlet excited state to triplet excited state of IR808 up to 99.3% through the heavy atom effect. By virtue of the efficient triplet sensitization&#160;of IR808, the optimal UC luminescence (UCL) intensity of IR808&#8208;modified CsLu  2  F  7  :Yb/Er NCs is enhanced by 1309 times upon excitation at 808 nm. The enhancement factor is more than one order of magnitude higher than that based on the well&#8208;established NaYF  4  :Yb/Er NCs. Benefiting from the intense dye&#8208;triplet&#8208;sensitized UCL, the nanoprobes are demonstrated for sensitive assay of extracellular and intracellular hypochlorite with an 808&#8208;nm/980&#8208;nm dual excited ratiometric strategy, thus revealing the great potential of the proposed nanoprobes for monitoring biomolecules and biochemical processes in live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Hyperbranched Microwire Networks of Organic Cocrystals with Optical Waveguiding and Light&#8208;Harvesting Abilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of hyperbranched organic microwire (MW) networks comprising 1,4&#8208;bis(pentafluorostyryl)benzene (10Ft) and 9,10&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BA) using a simple solution co&#8208;assembly route. Neither pure 10Ft nor BA assemblies can produce such complex MW networks apart from a binary cocrystal of 10Ft and BA with a 2:1 molar ratio ((2:1)10Ft:BA) formed via intermolecular arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (AP) interaction. A new generation of multiple MWs grow epitaxially on the previous generation of MWs to form MW arrays, in which BA may also act as an intermediate product to facilitate the regeneration of (2:1)10Ft:BA. Highly aligned and well&#8208;connected MW networks enable the superior optical waveguiding ability. Moreover, a red&#8208;emitting dopant, 5,12&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)naphthacene (BN) was incorporated into (2:1)10Ft:BA host MWs, giving light&#8208;harvesting hierarchical MW networks via an energy transfer (ET) process. The realization of the hyperbranched MWs provides us a deep insight into the rational creation of complex branched arrays from functional organic cocrystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Guest&#8208;Driven Light&#8208;Induced Spin Change in an Azobenzene

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that can be reversibly switched by light are of immense interest. Among them, photo&#8208;responsive spin crossover (SCO) complexes have great promises to combine the photoactive inputs with multifaceted outputs into switchable materials and devices. However, the reversible control the spin&#8208;state change by photochromic guests is still challenging. Herein, we report an unprecedented guest&#8208;driven light&#8208;induced spin change (GD&#8208;LISC) in a Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), [Fe(bpn){Ag(CN)  2  }  2  ]&#183;azobenzene. (  1  , bpn = 1,4&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)naphthalene). The reversible  trans&#8722;cis  photoisomerization of azobenzene guest upon UV/vis irradiation in the solid state results in the remarkable magnetic changes in a wide temperature range of 10&#8722;180 K. This finding not only establishes a new switching mechanism for SCO complexes, but also paves the way toward the development of new generation of photo&#8208;responsive magnetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Active exsolved metal&#8208;oxide interfaces in porous single&#8208;crystalline ceria monoliths for efficient and durable CH4/CO2 reforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dry reforming of CH4/CO2 provides an attractive route to convert greenhouse gas into syngas; however, the resistance to sintering and coking of catalyst remains a fundamental challenge at high operation temperatures. Here we create active and durable metal&#8208;oxide interface in porous single&#8208;crystalline (PSC) CeO2 monoliths with in situ exsolved single&#8208;crystalline (SC) Ni particles and show efficient dry reforming of CH4/CO2 at temperature as low as 450 &#176;C. We show the excellent and durable performance with ~20% of CH4 conversion and ~30% of CO2 conversion even in a continuous operation of 240 hours. The well&#8208;defined active metal&#8208;oxide interfaces, created by exsolving SC Ni nanoparticles from PSC NixCe1&#8208;xO2 to anchor them on PSC CeO2 scaffolds, prevent nanoparticle sintering and enhance the coking resistance due to the stronger metal&#8722;support interactions. Our work would enable an industrially and economically viable path for carbon reclamation, and the technique of creating active and durable metal&#8208;oxide interfaces in PSC monoliths could lead to stable catalyst designs for many challenging reactions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn&#8208;based oxides have sparked extensive scientific interest for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to the rich abundance, plentiful oxidation states, and high output voltage. However, the further development of Mn&#8208;based oxides is severely hindered by the rapid capacity decay during cycling. Herein, a two&#8208;step metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;engaged templating strategy has been developed to rationally synthesize heterostructured Mn  2  O  3  &#8208;ZnMn  2  O  4  hollow octahedrons (MO&#8208;ZMO HOs) for stable zinc ion storage. The distinctive composition and hollow heterostructure endow MO&#8208;ZMO HOs with abundant active sites, enhanced electric conductivity, and superior structural stability. By virtue of these advantages, the MO&#8208;ZMO HOs electrode shows high reversible capacity, impressive rate performance, and outstanding electrochemical stability. Furthermore, ex situ characterizations reveal that the charge storage of MO&#8208;ZMO HOs mainly originates from the highly reversible Zn  2+  insertion/extraction reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Tridecasaccharide Lipooligosaccharide Antigen from the Opportunistic Pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tridecasaccharide glycan domain of lipooligosaccharides from the opportunistic pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii was synthesized. The target (see structure) possesses structural motifs that make its synthesis a formidable challenge, including rare monosaccharides, an asymmetrically substituted trehalose residue and a base&#8208;sensitive amide side chain. The study provides a strategy for synthesizing other members of this unusual class of molecules.







Abstract
The outer surfaces of mycobacteria, including the organism that causes tuberculosis, are decorated with an array of immunomodulatory glycans. Among these are lipooligosaccharides (LOSs), a class of molecules for which the function remains poorly understood. We describe the chemical synthesis of the glycan portion of a tridecasaccharide LOS from the opportunistic pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii. The target contains a number of unusual structural motifs that complicate its assembly and is the most complex mycobacterial LOS glycan to be synthesized to date when considering size and number of unique monosaccharides and glycosidic linkages. These studies not only provide a roadmap for the preparation of additional members of this family of glycans, but also provides a valuable probe for use in structure&#8211;activity relationship investigations.

         <title>Single&#8208;Phase Formation of Rh2O3 Nanoparticles on h&#8208;BN Support for Highly Controlled Methane Partial Oxidation to Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;phase Rh2O3 nanocatalyst is developed by exploiting the stabilization of the (110) plane of the Rh2O3(I) seed on hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) after decomposition of the rhodium precursor. By using the Rh/h&#8208;BN, catalytic methane partial oxidation to syngas was accomplished solely via the direct route.







Abstract
Single&#8208;phase formation of active metal oxides on supports has been vigorously pursued in many catalytic applications to suppress undesired reactions and to determine direct structure&#8208;property relationships. However, this is difficult to achieve in nanoscale range because the effect of non&#8208;uniform metal&#8208;support interfaces becomes dominant in the overall catalyst growth, leading to the nucleation of various metastable oxides. Herein, we develop a supported single&#8208;phase corundum&#8208;Rh2O3(I) nanocatalyst by utilizing controlled interaction between metal oxide and h&#8208;BN support. Atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy and first&#8208;principle calculation reveal that single&#8208;phase formation occurs via uniform and preferential attachment of Rh2O3(I) (110) seed planes on well&#8208;defined h&#8208;BN surface after decomposition of rhodium precursor. By utilizing the Rh/h&#8208;BN catalyst in methane partial oxidation, syngas is successfully produced solely following the direct route with keeping a H2/CO ratio of 2, which makes it ideal for most downstream chemical processes.

         <title>Unraveling the Origin of Sulfur&#8208;Doped Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Activity: Effect of Iron Spin&#8208;State Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of sulfur&#8208;doped Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts is studied from Fe spin&#8208;state tuning. Operando 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra monitoring further supported the low&#8208;spin (LS) single&#8208;Fe3+&#8208;atom of the C&#8208;FeN4&#8208;S moiety as the active site for the ORR.







Abstract
Heteroatom doped atomically dispersed Fe1&#8208;NC catalysts have been found to show excellent activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the origin of the enhanced activity is still controversial because the structure&#8208;function relationship governing the enhancement remains elusive. Herein, sulfur(S)&#8208;doped Fe1&#8208;NC catalyst was obtained as a model, which displays a superior activity for ORR towards the traditional Fe&#8208;NC materials. 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that incorporation of S in the second coordination sphere of Fe1&#8208;NC can induce the transition of spin polarization configuration. Operando 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra definitively identified the low spin single&#8208;Fe3+&#8208;atom of C&#8208;FeN4&#8208;S moiety as the active site for ORR. Moreover, DFT calculations unveiled that lower spin state of the Fe center after the S doping promotes OH* desorption process.

     alt="Unraveling the Origin of Sulfur-Doped Fe-N-C Single-Atom Catalyst for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Activity: Effect of Iron Spin-State Tuning"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of sulfur-doped Fe-N-C single-atom catalysts is studied from Fe spin-state tuning. Operando &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra monitoring further supported the low-spin (LS) single-Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-atom of the C-FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-S moiety as the active site for the ORR.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heteroatom doped atomically dispersed Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-NC catalysts have been found to show excellent activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the origin of the enhanced activity is still controversial because the structure-function relationship governing the enhancement remains elusive. Herein, sulfur(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-doped Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-NC catalyst was obtained as a model, which displays a superior activity for ORR towards the traditional Fe-NC materials. &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that incorporation of S in the second coordination sphere of Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-NC can induce the transition of spin polarization configuration. Operando &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra definitively identified the low spin single-Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-atom of C-FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-S moiety as the active site for ORR. Moreover, DFT calculations unveiled that lower spin state of the Fe center after the S doping promotes OH* desorption process. This work elucidates the underlying mechanisms towards S doping for enhancing ORR activity, and paves a way to investigate the function of broader heteroatom doped Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-NC catalysts to offer a general guideline for spin-state-determined ORR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of a Dicationic Diazahexabenzocoronene Derivative on the Au(111) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hexabenzocoronene derivative embedded with graphitic nitrogen in its honeycomb lattice is prepared by on&#8208;surface assisted cyclodehydrogenation on the Au(111) surface. Combined scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy investigations unveil the chemical and electronic structures of the obtained dicationic nanographene.







Abstract
The atomically precise control over the size, shape and structure of nanographenes (NGs) or the introduction of heteroatom dopants into their sp2&#8208;carbon lattice confer them valuable electronic, optical and magnetic properties. Herein, we report on the design and synthesis of a hexabenzocoronene derivative embedded with graphitic nitrogen in its honeycomb lattice, achieved via on&#8208;surface assisted cyclodehydrogenation on the Au(111) surface. Combined scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy investigations unveil the chemical and electronic structures of the obtained dicationic NG. Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements reveal a considerable variation of the local contact potential difference toward lower values with respect to the gold surface, indicative of its positive net charge. Altogether, we introduce the concept of cationic nitrogen doping of NGs on surfaces, opening new avenues for the design of novel carbon nanostructures.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Red Laser with a Single Longitudinal Mode from Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red&#8208;emissive carbon dots (CDs) with high PLQY (65.5&#8201;%) were obtained by aliphatic precursors which combining graphitic nitrogen doping and surface modification. A planar microcavity with only one resonant mode, which fitted with the CDs&#8217; amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) peak, was constructed and resulted in a solid&#8208;state laser with a single longitudinal mode, a linewidth of 0.14&#8197;nm and a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 14.8&#8197;dB.







Abstract
Miniaturized solid&#8208;state lasers with a single longitudinal mode are vital for various photonic applications. Here we prepare red&#8208;emissive carbon dots (CDs) with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 65.5&#8201;% by combining graphitic nitrogen doping and surface modification. High&#8208;concentration doping alters the CDs&#8217; emission from blue to red, while the electron&#8208;donating groups and polymer coating on their surfaces improve the PLQY and photostability. The CDs exhibit excellent stimulated emission characteristics, with a low threshold of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and long gain lifetime. A planar microcavity with only one resonant mode, which fitted with the CDs&#8217; ASE peak, was constructed. Combining the CDs and microcavity produced a solid&#8208;state laser with a single longitudinal mode, a linewidth of 0.14&#8197;nm and a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 14.8&#8197;dB (Q&#8764;4600). Our results will aid the development of colorful solid&#8208;state micro/nano lasers with potential use in practical photonics.

         <title>Irradiation&#8208;Wavelength Directing Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Self&#8208;Organized Helical Superstructures Enabled by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Chiral Fluorescent Molecular Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phototuning the turning&#8208;off and the polarization inversion of circularly polarized luminescence signals is obtained in the corresponding photostationary state of the same helical cholesteric superstructure constructed from the light&#8208;driven hydrogen bonded chiral fluorescent molecular switch, which derives from the different conversion ratio of Z/E photoisomerization of the switch upon different light irradiations.







Abstract
Two light&#8208;driven chiral fluorescent molecular switches, (R,S,R)&#8208;switch 1 and (R,S,R)&#8208;switch 2, are prepared by means of hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) assembly of a photoresponsive (S) chiral fluorescent molecule, respectively with a cyano substitution at different positions as an H&#8208;bond acceptor and an opposite (R) chiral molecule as an H&#8208;bond donor. The resulting two switches exhibit tunable and reversible Z/E photoisomerization irradiated with 450&#8197;nm blue and 365&#8197;nm UV light. When doped into an achiral liquid crystal, both switches are found to be able to form a CPL tunable luminescent helical superstructure. In contrast to the tunable CPL characteristics of the system incorporating switch 2, exposure of the system incorporating switch 1 to 365&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm radiation can lead to controllable different photostationary CPL behavior, including switching&#8208;off and polarization inversion. In addition, optical information coding is demonstrated using the system containing switch 1.

         <title>Unexpected Formation of Metallofulleroids from Multicomponent Reactions, with Crystallographic and Computational Studies of the Cluster Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various metallofulleroids were generated from a new isocyanide&#8208;induced multicomponent reaction on clusterfullerenes. One ketenimine metallofulleroid has fixed Lu3N cluster due to the presence of the nearby organic appendant from a neighbor molecule in the solid state.







Abstract
New multicomponent reactions involving an isocyanide, terminal or internal alkynes, and endohedral metallofullerene (EMF) Lu3N@C80 yield metallofulleroids which are characterized by mass&#8208;spectrometry, HPLC, and multiple 1D and 2D NMR techniques. Single crystal studies revealed one ketenimine metallofulleroid has ordered Lu3N cluster which is unusual for EMF monoadducts. Computational analysis, based on crystallographic data, confirm that the endohedral cluster motion is controlled by the position of the exohedral organic appendants. Our findings provide a new functionalization reaction for EMFs, and a potential facile approach to freeze the endohedral cluster motion at relatively high temperatures.

&lt;p&gt;Various metallofulleroids were generated from a new isocyanide-induced multicomponent reaction on clusterfullerenes. One ketenimine metallofulleroid has fixed Lu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N cluster due to the presence of the nearby organic appendant from a neighbor molecule in the solid state.

         <title>Smart Tumor&#8208;Cell&#8208;Derived Microparticles Provide On&#8208;Demand Photosensitizer Synthesis and Hypoxia Relief for Photodynamic Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
Accurate co&#8208;localization of PpIX and O2: HAL and 3BP&#8208;loaded microparticles specifically target and recognize tumor cells, wherein HAL induces the biosynthesis of PpIX in mitochondria and 3BP reduces the mitochondria oxygen consumption. The precise co&#8208;localization of PpIX and O2 produces sufficient singlet oxygen to directly disrupt mitochondria, significantly improving PDT.







Abstract
Positioning essential elements of photodynamic therapy (PDT) near to mitochondria can conquer the rigorous spatiotemporal limitations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) transfer and make considerable differences in PDT. However, precise accumulation of photosensitizer (PS) and oxygen within mitochondria is still challenging. We simultaneously encapsulated hexyl 5&#8208;aminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL) and 3&#8208;bromopyruvic acid (3BP) into microparticles collected from X&#8208;ray&#8208;irradiated tumor cells (X&#8208;MP). After systemic administration, the developed HAL/3BP@X&#8208;MP can specifically target and recognize tumor cells, where HAL induces efficient accumulation of PpIX in mitochondria via the intrinsic haem biosynthetic pathway. Meanwhile, 3BP remarkably increases the oxygen supply by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. The accurate co&#8208;localization and prompt encounter of PpIX and oxygen produce sufficient ROS to directly disrupt mitochondria, resulting in significantly improved PDT outcomes.

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of Modular and Asymmetric Baskets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepwise Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of custom&#8208;built A, B, and C building blocks gives ABC baskets. Such enantioselective and modular construction allows choosing dept and shape of the cavitand's nonpolar pocket while also selecting desired functional groups at the rim. Building more effective mimics of biological receptors and catalysts is within reach.







Abstract
The precise positioning of functional groups about the inner space of abiotic hosts is a challenging task and of interest for developing more effective receptors and catalysts akin to those found in nature. To address it, we herein report a synthetic methodology for preparing basket&#8208;like cavitands comprised of three different aromatics as side arms with orthogonal esters at the rim for further functionalization. First, enantioenriched A (borochloronorbornene), B (iodobromonorbornene), and C (boronorbornene) building blocks were obtained by stereoselective syntheses. Second, consecutive A&#8208;to&#8208;B and then AB&#8208;to&#8208;C Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura (SM) couplings were optimized to give enantioenriched ABC cavitand as the principal product. The robust synthetic protocol allowed us to prepare (a)&#8197;an enantioenriched basket with three benzene sides and each holding either tBu, Et, or Me esters, (b)&#8197;both enantiomers of a so&#8208;called &#8220;spiral staircase&#8221; basket with benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene groups surrounding the inner space, and (c)&#8197;a photo&#8208;responsive basket bearing one anthracene and two benzene arms.

         <title>Studying the Conversion Mechanism to Broaden Cathode Options in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond Zn&#8208;ion intercalation, the conversion mechanism for Zn&#8208;ion storage and its diffusion pathway in CuI cathodes were studied. This direct conversion mechanism can be generalized to other high&#8208;capacity cathodes, such as Cu2S (336.7&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Cu2O (374.5&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1), indicating its practical universality, which enriches the Zn2+ storage mechanism and broadens the cathode horizons towards next&#8208;generation ZIBs.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are regarded as alternatives to Li&#8208;ion batteries benefiting from both improved safety and environmental impact. The widespread application of ZIBs, however, is compromised by the lack of high&#8208;performance cathodes. Currently, only the intercalation mechanism is widely reported in aqueous ZIBs, which significantly limits cathode options. Beyond Zn&#8208;ion intercalation, we comprehensively study the conversion mechanism for Zn2+ storage and its diffusion pathway in a CuI cathode, indicating that CuI occurs a direct conversion reaction without Zn2+ intercalation due to the high energy barrier for Zn2+ intercalation and migration. Importantly, this direct conversion reaction mechanism can be readily generalized to other high&#8208;capacity cathodes, such as Cu2S (336.7&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Cu2O (374.5&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1), indicating its practical universality. Our work enriches the Zn&#8208;ion storage mechanism and significantly broadens the cathode horizons towards next&#8208;generation ZIBs.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereodivergent Synthesis of Spirocycles through Dual&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Annulation of 2&#8208;Vinyloxiranes with Nucleophilic Dipoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulation of 2&#8208;vinyloxiranes with the challenging nucleophilic dipoles (imino esters) was achieved. It was successfully applied to the stereodivergent synthesis of structurally rigid spirocyclic framework. A series of spiro compounds bearing a pyrroline and an olefin were synthesized in an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent manner.







Abstract
The development of efficient and straightforward methods for obtaining all optically active isomers of structurally rigid spirocycles from readily available starting materials is of great value in drug discovery and chiral ligand development. However, the stereodivergent synthesis of spirocycles bearing multiple stereocenters remains an unsolved challenge owing to steric hindrance and ring strain. Herein, we report an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent synthesis of rigid spirocycles through dual&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of oxy &#960;&#8208;allyl metallic dipoles with less commonly employed nucleophilic dipoles (imino esters). A series of spiro compounds bearing a pyrroline and an olefin were easily synthesized in an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent manner (up to 19:1 dr, &gt;99&#8201;% ee), which showed great promise as a new type of N&#8208;olefin ligand. Preliminary mechanistic studies were also carried out to understand the process of this bimetallic catalysis.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Copper/Cobalt Hybrids via Lewis Acidic Molten Salts Etching for High Performance Symmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ti3C2 MXene&#8208;Cu/Co hybrids were fabricated through molten salt etching for illustrating their interactions. The pseudocapacitive contribution of Cu and a splendid specific capacitance of Ti3C2&#8208;Cu were demonstrated. A symmetric supercapacitor based on Ti3C2&#8208;Cu electrode delivered a high energy density of 103.3&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
MXenes have attracted great interests as supercapacitors due to their metallic conductivity, high density, and hydrophilic nature. Herein we report Ti3C2&#8208;Cu/Co hybrids via molten salt etching in which the existence of metal atoms and their interactions with MXene via surficial O atoms were elucidated by XAFS for the first time. The electrochemical investigation of Ti3C2&#8208;Cu electrode demonstrated the pseudocapacitive contribution of Cu and a splendid specific capacitance of 885.0&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 1.0&#8197;M H2SO4. Symmetric supercapacitor Ti3C2&#8208;Cu//Ti3C2&#8208;Cu was demonstrated with operating voltage of 1.6&#8197;V, areal capacitance of 290.5&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stability over 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles. It delivered an areal energy density of 103.3&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at power density of 0.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, based on which a supercapacitor pouch was fabricated. It provides deeper insights into the molten salt mechanism and strategies for designing MXene&#8208;based materials for electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Influence of Isomerism on Radioluminescence of Purely Organic Phosphorescence Scintillators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an isomerism strategy to study the effect of molecular structures on radioluminescence. Under UV&#8208;light excitation, all isomers showed bright phosphorescence with an efficiency of up to 22.8&#8201;%. Unexpectedly, both m&#8208;BA and p&#8208;BA scintillators showed bright luminescence under X&#8208;ray irradiation, which was ascribed to both excellent electrical conductivity and efficient suppression of non&#8208;radiative decay.







Abstract
There are few reports about purely organic phosphorescence scintillators, and the relationship between molecular structures and radioluminescence in organic scintillators is still unclear. Here, we presented isomerism strategy to study the effect of molecular structures on radioluminescence. The isomers can achieve phosphorescence efficiency of up to 22.8&#8201;% by ultraviolet irradiation. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, both m&#8208;BA and p&#8208;BA show excellent radioluminescence, while o&#8208;BA has almost no radioluminescence. Through experimental and theoretical investigation, we found that radioluminescence was not only affected by non&#8208;radiation in emissive process, but also highly depended on the material conductivity caused by the different molecular packing. This study not only allows us to clearly understand the relationship between the molecular structures and radioluminescence, but also provides a guidance to rationally design new organic scintillators.

         <title>Chiral Recognition on Bare Gold Surfaces by Quartz Crystal Microbalance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) system, a bare gold surface which has chiral phases was shown to prefer the adsorption of D&#8208;type amino acid without relying on the organic selector layer on the surface.







Abstract
Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is one of the powerful tools for the studies of molecular recognition and chiral discrimination. Its efficiency mainly relies on the design of the functional sensitive layer on the electrode surface. However, the organic sensitive layer may easily cause dissipation of oscillation or detachment and weaken the signal transfer during the molecular recognition processes. In this work, we reveal for the first time that the bare metal surface without the organic selector layer has the capability for chiral recognition in the QCM system. During the adsorption of various chiral amino acids, relatively higher selectivity of D&#8208;enantiomers on gold (Au) surface was shown by the QCM detection. Based on analyses of the surface crystalline structure and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the chiral nature of Au surface plays an important role in the selective binding of specific D&#8208;amino acids. These results may open new insights on chiral detection by QCM system. It will also promote the construction of novel chiral sensing systems with both efficient detection and separation capability.

         <title>Reduction of Nitrogen Oxides by Hydrogen with Rhodium(I)&#8211;Platinum(II) Olefin Complexes as Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyzed hydrogenation of NO2, NO, and N2O is achieved under mild conditions by air stable olefin RhI&#8211;PtII bimetallic complexes. In the molecular catalysts, the Rh&#8722;Pt interaction is a direct metal&#8722;metal bond and cooperativity of both metals in substrate activation is proposed based on DFT. A hyponitrite rhodium complex is a key intermediate for the N&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming step in the catalytic reduction of NO.







Abstract
The nitrogen oxides NO2, NO, and N2O are among the most potent air pollutants of the 21st century. A bimetallic RhI&#8211;PtII complex containing an especially designed multidentate phosphine olefin ligand is capable of catalytically detoxifying these nitrogen oxides in the presence of hydrogen to form water and dinitrogen as benign products. The catalytic reactions were performed at room temperature and low pressures (3&#8211;4&#8197;bar for combined nitrogen oxides and hydrogen gases). A turnover number (TON) of 587 for the reduction of nitrous oxide (N2O) to water and N2 was recorded, making these RhI&#8211;PtII complexes the best homogeneous catalysts for this reaction to date. Lower TONs were achieved in the conversion of nitric oxide (NO, TON=38) or nitrogen dioxide (NO2, TON of 8). These unprecedented homogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation reactions of NOx were investigated by a combination of multinuclear NMR techniques and DFT calculations, which provide insight into a possible reaction mechanism. The hydrogenation of NO2 proceeds stepwise, to first give NO and H2O, followed by the generation of N2O and H2O, which is then further converted to N2 and H2O. The nitrogen&#8722;nitrogen bond&#8208;forming step takes place in the conversion from NO to N2O and involves reductive dimerization of NO at a rhodium center to give a hyponitrite (N2O22&#8722;) complex, which was detected as an intermediate.

         <title>Tetrahedral [Sb(AuMe)4]3&#8722; Occurring in Multimetallic Cluster Syntheses: About the Structure&#8208;Directing Role of Methyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[Sb(AuMe)4]3&#8722; formed in a reaction of (Sn2Sb2)2&#8722; with [AuMePPh3] that affords multimetallic clusters for other reactant ratios. A central Sb atom bridges four free&#8208;standing {AuMe} units, which is unprecedented for main group metal complexes. Comprehensive DFT investigations explained the stability of the tetrahedral structure relative to a pyramidal one found in related molecules and shed light on the reaction space of said multimetallic species.







Abstract
The anion of [K(crypt&#8208;222)]3[Sb(AuMe)4]&#8901;py (1; crypt&#8208;222=4,7,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaoxa&#8208;1,10&#8208;diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane; py=pyridine) represents a rare example of a homoleptic heavy p&#8208;block metal atom being surrounded by four free&#8208;standing transition metal complex fragments, and the third example for a corresponding Sb compound. In contrast to all reported complexes of this type, the transition metal atoms possess twofold coordination only, hence the complex as a whole does not exhibit significant steric shielding or further linkage of the metal atoms. This is reflected in a high flexibility, as confirmed by slight deviations from a tetrahedral coordination of the Sb atom in the crystal and soft vibrational modes. An alternative pyramidal conformer, observed for a related arsenic compound with terminal phosphine ligands, is apparently disfavored owing to electron correlation effects. The compound is formed in a reaction that in another solvent or at other reactant concentrations yields salts of ternary cluster anions. By a combined experimental and theoretical study of different reaction conditions and previously unidentified side&#8208;products, we provide insight into multimetallic cluster synthesis reactions.

         <title>Direct Experimental Characterization of a Bridged Bicyclic Glycosyl Dioxacarbenium Ion by 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR Spectroscopy: Importance of Conformation on Participation by Distal Esters</title>

Simple methylation at the 4&#8208;position of a 4&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl galactopyranosyl donor enables direct observation by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy of the previously elusive bridging dioxacarbenium ion, supporting the hypothesis that distal group participation by secondary esters is disfavored by the conformation of the ester.







Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature NMR studies with a 4&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl galactopyranosyl donor enable the observation and characterization of a bridged bicyclic dioxacarbenium ion arising from participation by a distal ester. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies reveal this bridged ion to decompose at temperatures above &#8776;&#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C. In the absence of the methyl group, the formation of a bicyclic ion is not observed. It is concluded that participation by typical secondary distal esters in glycosylation reactions is disfavored in the ground state conformation of the ester from which it is stereoelectronically impossible. Methylation converts the secondary ester to a conformationally more labile tertiary ester, removes this barrier, and renders participation more favorable. Nevertheless, the minor changes in selectivity in model glycosylation reactions on going from the secondary to the tertiary esters at both low and room temperature argue against distal group participation being a major stereodirecting factor even for the tertiary system.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Induced Perpetual Recovery on All Elemental Defects in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards stable solar cells, ferrocene as a perpetual recovering agent has been developed to fix all elemental defects in ABX3 perovskite by a chain&#8208;reaction cycle. The ferrocene cations can form a 1D perovskite structure which has suitable dissociation energy to covert back to light&#8208;harvesting 3D perovskite and reactivate its photovoltaic performance. Based on this recovering agent, perovskite solar cell can achieve &gt;10&#8201;000&#8197;h lifetime.







Abstract
Lead halide perovskites always emerge complex interactions among different elemental ions, which lead to multiple intrinsic imperfections. Elemental defects, such as amine, Pb, and I vacancies at A&#8208;, B&#8208;, and X&#8208;sites, are main issues to deteriorate perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Unfortunately, most previous passivators can only temporarily fix partial inactive vacancies as sacrificial agents. Herein, we propose a recovery agent, ferrocene (Fc), which can form a one&#8208;dimensional perovskite with adequate steric cavities and suitable dissociation energy to recover all elemental defects back to active light&#8208;harvesting perovskites, and regenerate Fc itself meanwhile. Based on this perpetual chain&#8208;reaction cycle, corresponding PSCs maintain &gt;10&#8201;000&#8208;hour lifetime in inert condition and &gt;1000&#8208;hour durabilities under various extreme environments, including continuous 85&#8201;&#176;C heating, 50&#8201;% relative humidity wetting, and 1&#8208;sun light soaking.

         <title>Dynamic Control of Sacrificial Bond Transformation in the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Molecular Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bond breaking/re&#8208;formation to tune local coordination: Deliberate construction and subsequent selective cleavage of sacrificial Fe&#8722;S bonds render flexible tunability to control the local coordination of metal single atoms. The oxidized sulfur functionalization around the Fe center helps the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C reach the ORR volcano&#8208;plot apex by optimizing the adsorption strength of the oxygenated intermediates.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen sites show great prospect for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), whereas the unsatisfactory adsorption&#8208;desorption behaviors of oxygenated intermediates on the metal centers impede improvement of the ORR performance. We propose a new conceptual strategy of introducing sacrificial bonds to remold the local coordination of Fe&#8722;Nx sites, via controlling the dynamic transformation of the Fe&#8722;S bonds in the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalyst. Spectroscopic and theoretical results reveal that the selective cleavage of the sacrificial Fe&#8722;S bonds induces the incorporation of the electron&#8208;withdrawing oxidized sulfur on the Fe centers. The newly functionalized moieties endow the catalyst with superior ORR activity and remarkable stability, owing to the reduced electron localization around the Fe centers facilitating the desorption of ORR intermediates. These findings provide a unique perspective for precisely controlling the coordination structure of single&#8208;atom materials to optimize their activity.

         <title>Iodide&#8208;Induced Fragmentation of Polymerized Hydrophilic Carbon Nitride for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Homogeneous Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodide ions are utilized as an inhibitor for terminating the polymerization of PCN (TP&#8208;PCN). The resulting ultrathin and small&#8208;sized TP&#8208;PCN have abundant edge active sites (AEASs). They greatly enhance the O2 adsorption/activation capacity and the 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) selectivity. As expected, the TP&#8208;PCN affords a remarkably increased photocatalytic H2O2 production activity.







Abstract
Polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) as a class of two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR) photocatalyst has attracted much attention for H2O2 production. However, the low activity and inferior selectivity of 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR greatly restrict the H2O2 production efficiency. Herein, we develop a new strategy to synthesize hydrophilic, fragmented PCN photocatalyst by the terminating polymerization (TP&#8208;PCN) effect of iodide ions. The obtained TP&#8208;PCN with abundant edge active sites (AEASs), which can form quasi&#8208;homogeneous photocatalytic system, exhibits superior H2O2 generation rate (3265.4&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1), far surpassing PCN and other PCN&#8208;based photocatalysts. DFT calculations further indicate that TP&#8208;PCN is more favorable for electron transiting from &#946; spin&#8208;orbital to the &#960;* orbitals of O2, which optimizes O2 activation and reduces the energy barrier of H2O2 formation. This work provides a new concept for designing functional photocatalysts and understanding the mechanism of O2 activation in ORR for H2O2 production.

The obtained TP-PCN with abundant edge active sites (AEASs), which can form quasi-homogeneous photocatalytic system, exhibits superior H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation rate (3265.4&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), far surpassing PCN and other PCN-based photocatalysts. DFT calculations further indicate that TP-PCN is more favorable for electron transiting from &#946; spin-orbital to the &#960;* orbitals of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which optimizes O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and reduces the energy barrier of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation. This work provides a new concept for designing functional photocatalysts and understanding the mechanism of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation in ORR for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed s&#8208;Block Magnesium Sites for Electroreduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed magnesium atoms embedded in graphitized C3N4 (Mg&#8208;C3N4) show weak CO adsorption because of nondirectionally delocalized Mg 3&#8197;s orbit. Mg&#8208;C3N4 exhibits a high turnover frequency (TOF) of &#8776;18&#8201;000&#8197;hour&#8722;1 under a CO Faradaic efficiency &#8805;90&#8201;%. Furthermore, the flow cell fabricated with Mg&#8208;C3N4 reaches a large current density of &#8722;300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under a CO Faradaic efficiency &#8805;90&#8201;%.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed transition metal sites have been extensively studied for CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO due to their robust CO2 activation ability. However, the strong hybridization between directionally localized d orbits and CO vastly limits CO desorption and thus the activities of atomically dispersed transition metal sites. In contrast, s&#8208;block metal sites possess nondirectionally delocalized 3s orbits and hence weak CO adsorption ability, providing a promising way to solve the suffered CO desorption issue. Herein, we constructed atomically dispersed magnesium atoms embedded in graphitic carbon nitride (Mg&#8208;C3N4) through a facile heat treatment for CO2RR. Theoretical calculations show that the CO desorption on Mg sites is easier than that on Fe and Co sites. This theoretical prediction is demonstrated by experimental CO temperature program desorption and in situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy. As a result, Mg&#8208;C3N4 exhibits a high turnover frequency of &#8776;18&#8201;000 per hour in H&#8208;cell and a large current density of &#8722;300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in flow cell, under a high CO Faradaic efficiency &#8805;90&#8201;% in KHCO3 electrolyte. This work sheds a new light on s&#8208;block metal sites for efficient CO2RR to CO.

         <title>An Effective Strategy for Designing Nonlinear Optical Crystals by Combining the Structure&#8208;Directing Property of Oxyfluorides with Chemical Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;centrosymmetric and polar Ba2[MoO3F(IO3)](MoO3F2) was synthesized by combining the structure&#8208;directing property of oxyfluorides with chemical substitution. Measurement of the optical properties shows that the compound satisfies all key property requirements to be promising application from UV to mid&#8208;infrared regions as SHG materials.







Abstract
Rationally designing a high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal remains a great ongoing challenge. It involves not only the design of noncentrosymmetric structures but also property optimization. In this communication, a new strategy for effectively designing the NLO crystal has been put forward, that is, using the structure&#8208;directing property of oxyfluoride anions to obtain a noncentrosymmetric and polar structure, and then by substitution of IO3&#8722; for isovalent F&#8722; anions to further enhance the SHG response. With this strategy, a new iodate fluoride, Ba2[MoO3F(IO3)](MoO3F2) has been successfully designed from the Ba2(MoO3F2)F2 with the cis&#8208;directing [MoO4F2]4&#8722; groups. It exhibits a large SHG response (&#8776;8&#215;KDP), a wide transparent region (0.30&#8211;10.92&#8197;&#956;m), a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LDT) (88.53&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and a large birefringence (&#8776;0.264@532&#8197;nm). These indicate Ba2[MoO3F(IO3)](MoO3F2) would be a promising NLO crystal.

         <dc:description>
Herein, a photocatalyzed, intramolecular C(sp2)&#8722;H amidation of N&#8208;benzoyloxyamides has been developed to afford &#948;&#8208;benzolactams with an aryl&#8208;alkyl &#963;&#8208;bond relocation. Upon the formation of amidyl radical via reductive N&#8722;O bond cleavage, selective radical ipso&#8208;addition followed by a redox&#8208;neutral radical&#8211;polar crossover was suggested to be responsible for the preferential C&#8722;C bond migration.







Abstract
We report an approach for the intramolecular C(sp2)&#8722;H amidation of N&#8208;acyloxyamides under photoredox conditions to produce &#948;&#8208;benzolactams with an aryl&#8208;alkyl &#963;&#8208;bond relocation. Computational studies on the designed reductive single electron transfer strategy led us to identify N&#8208;[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl] group as the most effective amidyl radical precursor. Upon the formation of an azaspirocyclic radical intermediate by the selective ipso&#8208;addition with outcompeting an ortho&#8208;attack, radical&#8211;polar crossover was then rationalized to lead to the rearomative ring&#8208;expansion with preferential C&#8722;C bond migration.

         <title>Corroles: The Hitherto Elusive Parent Macrocycle and its Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three synthetic routes to the completely unsubstituted corrole are described. This allows for full characterization of five metal complexes chelated by this corrole, which were used to uncover unique beneficial features that are relevant to clean energy catalysis and many other purposes.







Abstract
Corroles, macrocycles that owe their name to the cobalt&#8208;chelating prosthetic group of vitamin B12 and share numerous features with the iron&#8208;chelating porphyrin present in heme proteins/enzymes, constantly cross new boundaries ever since stable derivatives became easily accessible. Particularly important is the increasing utilization of corroles and the corresponding metal complexes for the benefit of mankind, in terms of new drug candidates for treating various diseases and as catalysts for sustainable energy relevant processes. One challenge is to gain access to the plain macrocycle, as to allow for full elucidation of the most fundamental properties of corroles. We have obtained the substituent&#8208;free corrole by several surprising and conceptually different pathways. Selected features of the corresponding metal complexes are illuminated, for pointing towards unique phenomena that are anticipated to largely expand the horizon regarding their utilization for contemporary catalysis.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction of Propargyl Esters and Alkynylsilanes: Synthesis of Vinylallene Derivatives through a Twofold 1,2&#8208;Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthesis of structurally complex allenylsilanes through gold&#8208;catalyzed coupling of propargyl esters with alkynylsilanes is described. DFT calculations support a stepwise pathway consisting of two 1,2&#8208;rearrangements (acyloxy and silyl). A preliminary study on the enantioselective version would demonstrate its feasibility (er up to 95:5).







Abstract
The reaction of propargyl esters with alkynylsilanes under gold catalysis provides vinylallene derivatives through consecutive [1,2]&#8208;acyloxy/[1,2]&#8208;silyl rearrangements. Good yields, full atom&#8208;economy, broad substrate scope, easy scale&#8208;up and low catalyst loadings are salient features of this novel transformation. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest a reaction mechanism involving initial [1,2]&#8208;acyloxy rearrangement to generate a gold vinylcarbene intermediate which upon regioselective attack of the alkynylsilane affords a vinyl cation which undergoes a type II&#8208;dyotropic rearrangement involving the silyl group and the metal fragment. Preliminary results on the enantioselective version of this transformation are also disclosed.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine compounds are powerful reagents for the development of novel transformations. As they exhibit low toxicity, high functional group tolerance and stability in biocompatible media, they have been used for the functionalization of biomolecules. Herein, we report recent advances up to June 2021 in peptide and protein modification using hypervalent iodine reagents. Their use as group transfer or oxidizing reagents is discussed in this review, including methods targeting polar, aromatic or aliphatic amino acids and peptide termini.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper hybrid lead bromide perovskite nanosheets of phase pure n = 2: stabilized colloids stored in the solid state</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper lead halide perovskite (RP&#8208;LHP) nanonanostructures can be regarded as self&#8208;assembled quantum wells or superlattices of 3D perovskites with an intrinsic quantum well thickness of a single or a few (  n  = 1&#8208;4) lead halide layers; the quantum wells are separated by organic layers. They can be scaled down to a single quantum well dimension. Here, the preparation of highly (photo)chemical and colloidal stable hybrid LHP nanosheets (NSs) of ca. 7.4 &#956;m lateral size and 2.5 nm quantum well height (thereby presenting a deep blue emission at ca. 440 nm), is reported for the first time. The NSs are close&#8208;lying and they even interconnect when deposited on a substrate. Their synthesis is based on the use of the  p  &#8208;toluenesulfonic acid/dodecylamine (  p  TS/DDA) ligand pair and their (photo)chemical stability and photoluminescence is enhanced by adding EuBr  2  nanodots (EuNDs). Strikingly, they can be preserved as a solid and stored for at least one year. The blue emissive colloid can be recovered from the solid as needed by simply dispersing the powder in toluene and then using it to prepare solid films, making them very promising candidates for manufacturing devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Flower&#8208;like colloidal particles through precipitation polymerization of redox responsive liquid crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the plethora of available anisotropic inorganic particles, it remains challenging to fabricate non&#8208;spherical polymer particles, especially with angular features. Here we report on the synthesis of monodisperse, flower&#8208;like, liquid crystalline (LC) polymer particles by precipitation polymerization of an LC monomer mixture consisting of benzoic acid&#8208;functionalized acrylates and disulfide&#8208;functionalized diacrylates. Introduction of a minor amount of disulfide&#8208;functionalized diacrylates (&#8804; 10 wt%) induced the formation of flower&#8208;like shapes. The shape of the particles can be tuned from flower&#8208; to disk&#8208;like to spherical by elevating the polymerization temperature. The solvent environment also has a pronounced effect on the particle size. Time&#8208;resolved TEM reveals that the final particle morphology was formed in the early stages of the polymerization and that subsequent polymerization resulted in continued particle growth without affecting the morphology. Finally, the degradation of the particles under reducing conditions was much faster for flower&#8208;like particles than for spherical particles, a result of their higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio. This work introduces a facile and scalable preparation of non&#8208;spherical anisotropic organic particles which may lead to potential applications ranging from smart coatings to redox responsive carrier systems..</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Nanopatterns of Molecular Spoked Wheels with Orthogonal Pillars: The Observation of a Fullerene Haze</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular spoked wheels with intraannular functionalizable pillars are synthesized in a modular approach. The functionalities at their ends are variable, and a propargyl alcohol, a [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyrate, and a perylene monoimide are investigated. All compounds form two&#8208;dimensional crystals on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite at the solid/liquid interface. As determined by submolecularly resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, the pillars adopt equilibrium distances of 6.0 nm. The fullerene has a residual mobility, limited by the length of the flexible connector unit. In contrast, the more rigidly attached perylene monoimide units remain oriented along the surface normal and maintain a smallest distance of 2 nm above the graphite substrate. The experimental results are supported and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. The robust packing concept also holds for cocrystals with molecular hexagons that expand the pillar&#8208;pillar distances by 15 % and block unspecific intercalation.</dc:description>

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Dearomatization by Intramolecular Hydroalkoxylation/Claisen Rearrangement: Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Spirolactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described herein is a novel Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroalkoxylation/Claisen rearrangement, allowing practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of a range of valuable spiro lactams from readily available ynamides in generally good to excellent yields with excellent diastereoselectivities and broad substrate scope. Importantly, an unexpected dearomatization of nonactivated arenes and heteroaromatic compounds is involved in this tandem sequence. Moreover, the asymmetric version of this tandem cyclization is also achieved via efficient kinetic resolution by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. In addition,  [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement  is proved to be kinetically preferred over the related [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement by theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of High Energy Density Diaminocyclopropenium&#8208;Phenothiazine Hybrid Catholytes for Non&#8208;Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report describes the development of diaminocyclopropenium&#8208;phenothiazine hybrid catholytes for nonaqueous redox flow batteries. The molecules are synthesized in a rapid and modular fashion by appending a diaminocyclopropenium (DAC) substituent to the nitrogen of the phenothiazine. Combining a versatile C&#8211;N coupling protocol (which provides access to diverse derivatives) with computation and structure&#8208;property analysis enabled the identification of a catholyte that displays stable two&#8208;electron cycling at potentials of 0.64 and 1.00 V vs Fc/Fc+ as well as high solubility in all oxidation states (&#8805;0.45 M in TBAPF6/MeCN). This catholyte was deployed in a high energy density two&#8208;electron RFB, exhibiting &gt;90% capacity retention over 266 hours of flow cell cycling at &gt;0.5 M electron concentration.</dc:description>

         <title>A Unified View on Varied Ultrafast Dynamics of the Primary Process in Microbial Rhodopsins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;  trans  to  13&#8208;cis  photoisomerization of the protonated retinal Schiff base (PRSB) chromophore is the primary step that triggers various biological functions of microbial rhodopsins. While this ultrafast primary process has been extensively studied, it has been recognized that the relevant excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics differ significantly from one rhodopsin to another. To elucidate the origin of the complicated ultrafast dynamics of the primary process in microbial rhodopsins, we studied the excited&#8208;state dynamics of proteorhodopsin, its D97N mutant, and bacteriorhodopsin by femtosecond time&#8208;resolved absorption (TA) spectroscopy in a wide pH range. The TA data showed that their excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics drastically change when the pH approaches the pK  a  of the counterion residue of the PRSB chromophore in the ground state. This result reveals that the varied excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics in different rhodopsins mainly originate from the difference of the ground&#8208;state heterogeneity, i.e., protonation/deprotonation of the PRSB counterion.</dc:description>

         <title>The Formal Cross&#8208;Coupling of Amines and Carboxylic Acids to Form sp3&#8211;sp3 Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a deaminative&#8208;decarboxylative protocol to form sp3&#8211;sp3 carbon&#8211;carbon bonds from activated amines and carboxylic acids. Amines and carboxylic acids are ubiquitous building blocks, available in broad chemical diversity and at lower cost than typical C&#8211;C coupling partners. To leverage amines and acids for C&#8211;C coupling, we developed a reductive nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling utilizing building block activation as pyridinium salts and redox active esters, respectively. Miniaturized high&#8208;throughput experimentation studies were critical to our reaction optimization, with subtle experimental changes such as order of reagent addition, composition of a binary solvent system, and ligand identity having a significant impact on reaction performance. The developed protocol is used in the late&#8208;stage diversification of pharmaceuticals while more than one thousand systematically captured and machine&#8208;readable reaction datapoints are reposited.</dc:description>

         <title>A Molecular Compound for Highly Selective Purification of Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Purification of C  2  H  4  from an C  2  H  4  /C  2  H  6  mixture is one of the most challenging separation processes, which is achieved mainly through energy&#8208;intensive, cryogenic distillation in industry. Sustainable, non&#8208;distillation methods are highly desired as alternatives. We discovered that the fluorinated bis(pyrazolyl)borate ligand supported copper(I) complex {[(CF  3  )  2  Bp]Cu}  3  has features very desirable in an olefin&#8208;paraffin separation material. It binds ethylene exclusively over ethane generating [(CF  3  )  2  Bp]Cu(C  2  H  4  ). This molecular compound exhibits extremely high and record IAST C  2  H  4  /C  2  H  6  gas separation selectivity, affording high purity (&gt; 99.5%) ethylene that can be readily desorbed from separation columns.  In&#8208;situ  PXRD provides a &#8220;live&#8221; picture of the reversible conversion between [(CF  3  )  2  Bp]Cu(C  2  H  4  ) and the ethylene free sorbent in the solid&#8208;state, driven by the presence or removal of C  2  H  4  . Molecular structures of trinuclear {[(CF  3  )  2  Bp]Cu}  3  and mononuclear [(CF  3  )  2  Bp]Cu(C  2  H  4  ) are also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Nanoislands on Ni/C Hybrid Nanosheet Activate Superior Hydrazine Oxidation Assisted High&#8208;efficient H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clean hydrogen evolution through electrochemical water splitting underpins various innovative approaches to the pursuit of sustainable energy conversion technologies, but it is blocked by the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during the water splitting. The hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) has been considered to be one of the most promising substitute for OER to improve the efficiency of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), however, the design of precise bifunctional catalysts which could integrate the high&#8208;efficient HER and HzOR activity is significant yet scarce. Herein, we originally construct novel dual nanoislands on Ni/C hybrid nanosheet array: one kind of island represents the part of bare Ni particle surface, while the other stands for the part of core&#8208;shell Ni@C structure (denoted as Ni&#8208;C HNSA), in which exposed Ni atoms and Ni&#8208;decorated carbon shell perform as active sites for HzOR and HER respectively. Simultaneously, the electrons of Ni in Ni@C islands will transfer to the C layer, causing the change of the electron density around the C layer, thereby accelerating the kinetics of HER. As a result, when the current density reaches 10 mA cm &#8208;2  , the overpotential of HER is merely 37 mV and the working potential of HzOR is as low as &#8208;20 mV. A two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer exhibits superb activity that only requiring an ultrasmall cell voltage of 0.2 V to achieve 50 mA cm &#8208;2  . This finding undoubtedly provides a new perspective for design of advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts, and propels the practical energy&#8208;saving H 2  generation techniques.</dc:description>

We propose a general principle, &#960;&#8208;conjugated confinement, for the rational design of high&#8208;performance DUV NLO materials whose band gaps are further enhanced. This principle is valid for all the DUV NLO materials known to date (the Chinese lunar year of the ox). Guided by this approach, the carbonophosphates are discovered for the first time as new DUV NLO candidates. Sr3Y[PO4][CO3]3 exhibits the shortest SHG output laser among phosphates to date.







Abstract
Current nonlinear optical materials face a conventional limitation in the trade&#8208;off between the band gap and birefringence, especially in the deep UV spectral region. To circumvent this dilemma, we propose a general principle, &#960;&#8208;conjugated confinement, to partially decouple the interunit &#960;&#8208;conjugated interactions by the separation of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated units. The goal is to further enlarge the band gap to a value larger than that of the singular &#960;&#8208;conjugated counterpart and to maintain a suitable density of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units to gain a large optical anisotropy. We reveal that &#960;&#8208;conjugated confinement is a shared structural feature for all DUV NLO materials known to date, and thus, it provides a novel and essential design criterion for future design synthesis. Guided by this principle, the carbonophosphates are predicted to be a new promising DUV candidate system. Sr3Y[PO4][CO3]3 (1) and Na3X[PO4][CO3] (X=Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, 2&#8211;5) exhibit not only greatly enhanced birefringence that is 3&#8211;24 times larger than that of singular phosphates but also enhanced band gaps that are 0.2&#8211;1.7&#8197;eV wider than those of singular carbonates.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Hollow Metal Sulfides via Reverse Cation Exchange Reactions for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu2&#8722;xS nanocube template&#8208;assisted route inspired by the hard soft acid base (HSAB) principle was employed for successfully synthesizing a family of hollow metal sulfide (CdS, ZnS, Ag2S, PbS, SnS, CuInS2, ZnxCd1&#8722;xS, ZnxCd1&#8722;xS&#8208;Pt1) via cation exchange reaction.







Abstract
Herein, we explore a general Cu2&#8722;xS nanocube template&#8208;assisted and reverse cation exchange&#8208;mediated growth strategy for fabricating hollow multinary metal sulfide. Unlike the traditional cation exchange method controlled by the metal sulfide constant, the introduction of tri&#8208;n&#8208;butylphosphine (TBP) can reverse cation exchange to give a series of hollow metal sulfides. A variety of hollow multinary metal sulfide cubic nanostructures has been demonstrated while preserving anisotropic shapes to the as&#8208;synthesized templates, including binary compounds (CdS, ZnS, Ag2S, PbS, SnS), ternary compound (CuInS2, ZnxCd1&#8722;xS), and quaternary compound (single&#8208;atom platinum anchored ZnxCd1&#8722;xS; ZnxCd1&#8722;xS&#8208;Pt1). Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the hollow metal sulfide semiconductors obtained could significantly improve the separation and migration of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. Owing to the efficient charge transfer, the ZnxCd1&#8722;xS&#8208;Pt1 exhibited outstanding photocatalytic performance of CO2 to CO, with the highest CO generation rate of 75.31&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Strongly Coupled Cobalt Diselenide Monolayers for Selective Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction to H2O2 under Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy that narrows the interlayer distance of cobalt diselenide (CoSe2) is reported, which enables strong coupling between CoSe2 monolayers. The strongly coupled CoSe2 can catalyze electrosynthesis of H2O2 in acidic media efficiently, which yields Faradaic efficiency of 96.7&#8201;%, current density of 50.04&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and product rate of 30.60&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, outperforming all catalysts reported previously in acidic environments.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the acidic environment could largely prevent its decomposition to water, but efficient catalysts that constitute entirely earth&#8208;abundant elements are lacking. Here we report the experimental demonstration of narrowing the interlayer gap of metallic cobalt diselenide (CoSe2), which creates high&#8208;performance catalyst to selectively drive two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction toward H2O2 in an acidic electrolyte. The enhancement of the interlayer coupling between CoSe2 atomic layers offers a favorable surface electronic structure that weakens the critical *OOH adsorption, promoting the energetics for H2O2 production. Consequently, on the strongly coupled CoSe2 catalyst, we achieved Faradaic efficiency of 96.7&#8201;%, current density of 50.04&#8197;milliamperes per square centimeter, and product rate of 30.60&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. Moreover, this catalyst shows no sign of degradation when operating at &#8722;63 milliamperes per square centimeter over 100&#8197;hours.

         <title>Dense Packing of Acetylene in a Stable and Low&#8208;Cost Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;microporous Al&#8208;MOF with suitable pore confinement enables the dense packing of C2H2 molecules for efficient C2H2/CO2 separation, exhibiting the benchmark balance between high separation performance, low cost, high stability, and large&#8208;scale synthesis for industrial applications.







Abstract
Porous materials for C2H2/CO2 separation mostly suffer from high regeneration energy, poor stability, or high cost that largely dampen their industrial implementation. A desired adsorbent should have an optimal balance between excellent separation performance, high stability, and low cost. We herein report a stable, low&#8208;cost, and easily scaled&#8208;up aluminum MOF (CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H) for highly efficient C2H2/CO2 separation. The suitable pore confinement in CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H can not only provide multipoint binding interactions with C2H2 but also enable the dense packing of C2H2 inside the pores. This material exhibits one of the highest C2H2 storage densities of 392&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 and highly selective adsorption of C2H2 over CO2 at ambient conditions, achieved by a low C2H2 adsorption enthalpy (27&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Breakthrough experiments confirm its exceptional separation performance for C2H2/CO2 mixtures, affording both large C2H2 uptake of 3.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and high separation factor of 3.4. CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H achieves the benchmark balance between separation performance, stability, and cost for C2H2/CO2 separation.

         <title>Stereodivergent Synthesis of Enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;Butyrolactones Bearing Two Vicinal Stereocenters Enabled by Synergistic Copper and Iridium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented asymmetric cascade allylation/lactonization between racemic aldimine esters and racemic vinylethylene carbonate catalyzed by synergistic Cu/Ir catalysis is presented. The metalated azomethine ylide acts as a two&#8208;atom unit and opens upaccess to a broad range of &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones bearing two vicinal stereogenic centers in a stereodivergent manner.







Abstract
By virtue of a fundamentally new reaction model of azomethine ylide serving as a two&#8208;atom synthon, we present the first example of stereodivergent preparation of &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones via synergistic Cu/Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade allylation/lactonization, and all four stereoisomers of &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones bearing two vicinal stereocenters are accessible with excellent diastereoselective and enantioselective control. The chiral IrIII&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate was separated and characterized to understand the origin of the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the initial C&#8722;C bond formation process. Control experiments shed some light on the catalyst/substrate and catalyst/catalyst interactions in this dual catalytic system to rationalize the related kinetic/dynamic kinetic resolution process with different catalyst combinations. The enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone products were converted into an array of structurally complex chiral molecules and organocatalysts that were otherwise inaccessible.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Alkynylation of 3,4&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium Ions Enables Collective Total Syntheses of Indole Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic asymmetric alkynylation of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ions was developed for the versatile synthesis of enantiomerically enriched C1&#8208;alkynyl tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines, the utility of which was demonstrated by concise collective total syntheses of the seven indole alkaloids harmicine, geissoschizol, geissoschizine, akuammicine, desethyleburnamonine, eburnamonine, and larutensine within 10 steps (see scheme).







Abstract
Chiral tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboline (TH&#946;C) is not only a prevailing structural feature of many natural alkaloids but also a versatile synthetic precursor for a vast array of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids. Asymmetric synthesis of C1&#8208;alkynyl TH&#946;Cs remains rarely explored and challenging. Herein, we describe the development of two complementary approaches for the catalytic asymmetric alkynylation of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ions with up to 96&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee. The utility of chiral C1&#8208;alkynyl TH&#946;Cs was demonstrated by the collective total syntheses of seven indole alkaloids: harmicine, eburnamonine, desethyleburnamonine, larutensine, geissoschizol, geissochizine, and akuammicine.

         <title>Cyano(triphenylsilyl)phosphanide as a Building Block for P,C,N Conjugated Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na[PCO] reacts with Ph3ECl (E=Si, Ge, Sn) and Na[N(SiMe3)2] to form the series of anions [Ph3E&#8722;P&#8722;CN]&#8722;. The silylated anion forms PCN heteroallenes in reactions with tetrel chlorides and binds via nitrogen to triphenylborane. P&#8208;nucleophilicity and lability of the silyl substituent in [Ph3Si&#8722;P&#8722;CN]&#8722; are evidenced in reactions with isocyanates and carbodiimides, which afford phosphorus analogues of cyanourea and 2&#8208;cyanoguanidine.







Abstract
The cyano(triphenylsilyl)phosphanide anion was prepared as a sodium salt from 2&#8208;phosphaethynolate. The electronic structure of this new cyano(silyl)phosphanide was studied via computational methods and its reactivity investigated using various electrophiles and Lewis acids, demonstrating its P&#8208; and N&#8208;nucleophilicity. The ambident reactivity is in agreement with computations. The silyl group also shows lability and therefore the cyano(silyl)phosphanide can be considered as a phosphacyanamide synthon, [PCN]2&#8722;, and serves as building block for the transfer of a PCN moiety.

Chiral indoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid enables a highly enantioselective Catellani&#8208;type annulation of (hetero)aryl iodides, alkenyl triflate and conjugated vinyl iodides with 4&#8208;(bromomethyl)cyclohexanone, directly assembling a diverse range of chiral all&#8208;carbon bridged ring systems.







Abstract
Chiral indoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid has been identified to enable a highly enantioselective Catellani&#8208;type annulation of (hetero)aryl, alkenyl triflate and conjugated vinyl iodides with 4&#8208;(bromomethyl)cyclohexanone, directly assembling a diverse range of chiral all&#8208;carbon bridged ring systems. Control experiments and DFT calculations suggest that the coordinating orientation of the chiral amino acid to the arylpalladium(II) center allows for high levels of stereochemical control.

         <title>Sn2PO4I: An Excellent Birefringent Material with Giant Optical Anisotropy in Non &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Phosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn2PO4I and Sn2BO3I are designed and synthesized successfully based on the unique two&#8208;dimensional layered structure in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), in which the birefringence of Sn2PO4I is the largest among the reported borates and phosphates.







Abstract
Exploring non &#960;&#8208;conjugated phosphate birefringent crystal with a large birefringence has been a great challenge. Herein, based on the unique two&#8208;dimensional layered structure in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), two new compounds, Sn2PO4I and Sn2BO3I, were designed and synthesized successfully, maintaining the layer structural feature and enhancing the optical anisotropy of crystals. In particular, the birefringence of Sn2PO4I is larger than or equal to 0.664 @546&#8197;nm, which is largest among the reported borates and phosphates, even surpassing commercial birefringent crystals YVO4 and TiO2. This work indicates that a breakthrough in birefringence of inorganic compound was achieved. Also, it provides a guiding idea for exploring large birefringence materials in the future.

         <title>Desolvation of Peptide Bond by O to S Substitution Impacts Protein Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C=O to C=S substitution in the amide bond dramatically alters the water structure around the thioamide bond, ultimately reducing the microenvironment polarity. The increased hydrophobicity of the modified peptide bond is utilized to amplify the thermostability of proteins by this single atom substitution.







Abstract
Amino acid side chains are key to fine&#8208;tuning the microenvironment polarity in proteins composed of polar amide bonds. Here, we report that substituting an oxygen atom of the backbone amide bond with sulfur atom desolvates the thioamide bond, thereby increasing its lipophilicity. The impact of such local desolvation by O to S substitution in proteins was tested by synthesizing thioamidated variants of Pin1 WW domain. We observe that a thioamide acts in synergy with nonpolar amino acid side chains to reduce the microenvironment polarity and increase protein stability by more than 14&#8201;&#176;C. Through favorable van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions, this single atom substitution significantly stabilizes proteins without altering the amino acid sequence and structure of the native protein.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of 2&#8208;Pyrones with Indenes: Total Syntheses of Cephanolides A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction could complement the conventional normal&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in the synthesis of six&#8208;membered carbocycles. However, catalytic asymmetric all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based IEDDA reactions are underdeveloped. Herein, we disclosed a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric IEDDA reaction using electron&#8208;deficient 3&#8208;carboalkoxyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrones and electronically unbiased indenes as reactants. This method enables the rapid and enantioselective construction of a wide range of hexahydrofluorenyl bridged&#8208;lactone scaffolds. Using this method, the asymmetric total syntheses of cephanolides A and B were accomplished.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and mechanism of action of small molecule inhibitors of ceramidases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sphingolipid metabolism is tightly controlled by enzymes to regulate essential processes in human physiology. The central metabolite is ceramide, a pro&#8208;apoptotic lipid catabolized by ceramidase enzymes to produce pro&#8208;proliferative sphingosine&#8208;1phosphate. Alkaline ceramidases are transmembrane enzymes that recently attracted attention for drug development in fatty liver diseases. However, due to their hydrophobic nature, no specific small molecule inhibitors have been reported. Here, we present the discovery and mechanism of action of the first drug&#8208;like inhibitors of alkaline ceramidase 3 (ACER3). In particular, we chemically engineered novel fluorescent ceramide substrates enabling screening of large compound libraries and characterized enzyme:inhibitor interactions using mass spectrometry and MD simulations. In addition to reveal a new paradigm for inhibition of lipid metabolising enzymes with nonlipidic small molecules, our data lay the ground for targeting ACER3 in drug discovery efforts.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetization Dynamics on Isotope&#8208;Isomorphic Holmium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we reported the deuteration of the metal&#8208;binding equatorial water molecules in a reported Ho  III  single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) with pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidal geometry, from [Ho(CyPh  2  PO)  2  (H  2  O)  5  ]  3+  to [Ho(CyPh  2  PO)  2  (D  2  O)  5  ]  3+  . The hyperfine structures originating from the nuclear spin of  165  Ho  III  can be clearly observed. Moreover, the resulting magnetization dynamics revealed the switch of the relative relaxation rates for the two isotope&#8208;isomorphic complexes &#8208; respectively faster/slower at low/high temperature. The noticeable isotope effect arises from not only the paramagnetic metal center but also the diamagnetic ligands, which can be explained by the  ab initio  calculated tunnel splitting and the involvement of the super&#8208;hyperfine interaction related to the difference in the nuclear spin number of protium (  1  H,  I  =  1  /  2  ) and deuterium (  2  H,  I  = 1).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Binary mesocrystals offer the combination of nanocrystal properties in an ordered superstructure. Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous self&#8208;assembly of platinum and iron&#8208;oxide nanocubes into micrometer sized 3D mesocrystals using the gas&#8208;phase diffusion technique. By the addition of minor amounts of a secondary particle type tailored to nearly identical size, shape and surface chemistry, we were able to promote a random incorporation of foreign particles into a self&#8208;assembling host lattice. The random distribution of the binary particle types on the surface and within its bulk has been visualized using advanced transmission and scanning electron microscopy techniques. The 20&#8208;40 &#181;m sized binary mesocrystals have been further characterized through wide and small angle scattering techniques to reveal a long&#8208;range ordering on the atomic scale throughout the crystal while showing clear evidence that the material consists of individual building blocks. Through careful adjustments of the crystallization parameters, we could further obtain a reverse superstructure, where incorporated particles and host lattice switch roles.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two macrocyclic architectures comprising oligothiophene strands that connect the imide positions of a perylene bisimide (PBI) have been synthesized  via  a platinum&#8208;mediated cross coupling strategy. The crystal structure of the double bridged PBI reveals all  syn&#8208;  arranged thiophene units which completely enclose the planar PBI chromophore via a 12&#8208;membered ring. The target structures were characterized by steady&#8208;state UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopy, as well as cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry. Both donor&#8208;acceptor dyads show ultrafast F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) and photoinduced electron transfer, thereby leading to extremely low fluorescence quantum yields even in the lowest polarity cyclohexane solvent.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation&#8208;Deficiency&#8208;Dependent CO2 Electroreduction over Copper&#8208;Based Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskite Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report an effective strategy to enhance CO2 electroreduction (CER) properties of Cu&#8208;based Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) perovskite oxides by engineering their A&#8208;site cation deficiencies. With La2&#8208;xCuO4&#8208;&#948; (L2&#8208;xC, x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalysts, we demonstrate that their CER activity and selectivity (to C2+ or CH4) show either a volcano&#8208;type or an inverted volcano&#8208;type dependence on the x values, with the extreme point at x = 0.1. Among them, at &#8208;1.4 V, the L1.9C delivers the optimal activity (51.3 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2) and selectivity (41.5%) for C2+, comparable to or better than those of most reported Cu&#8208;based oxides, while the L1.7C exhibits the best activity (25.1 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2) and selectivity (22.1%) for CH4. Such optimized CER properties could be ascribed to the favorable merits brought by the cation&#8208;deficiency&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies and/or CuO/RP hybrids, including the facilitated adsorption/activation of key reaction species and thus the manipulated reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Co3d and O2p band centers to inhibit oxygen escape for stable 4.6V LiCoO2 cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High voltage LiCoO  2  delivers a high capacity but sharp fading is a critical issue, and the capacity decay mechanism is also poorly understood. Herein, we clarify that the escape of surface oxygen and Li&#8208;insulator Co  3  O  4  formation are the main causes for the capacity fading of 4.6V LiCoO  2  . We further propose the inhibition of the oxygen escape for achieving stable 4.6V LiCoO  2  by tailoring the Co3d and O2p band center and enlarging their band gap with MgF  2  doping. This enhances the ionicity of the Co&#8208;O bond and the redox activity of Co, and improves cation migration reversibility. Moreover, the inhibition of oxygen escape suppresses the formation of Li&#8208;insulator Co  3  O  4  and maintains the surface structure integrity. Mg acts as a &#8220;pillar&#8221;, providing a stable and enlarged channel for fast Li  +  intercalation/extraction. The modulated LiCoO  2  shows almost &#8220;zero strain&#8221; and achieves a record capacity retention at 4.6V: 92% after 100 cycles at 1C and 86.4% after 1000 cycles at 5C. This work offers some insights into modulating the local electronic structure for high&#8208;voltage LiCoO  2  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A divergent synthesis of skeletally distinct arboridinine and arborisidine was achieved. The central divergent strategy was inspired by the divergent biosynthetic cyclization mode of arboridinine and arborisidine and their hidden topological connection. The branch point was synthesized through a Michael and Mannich cascade process. A site&#8208;selective intramolecular Mannich reaction was developed to construct the tetracyclic core of arboridinine, while a site&#8208;selective intramolecular  &#945;&#8208;amination of ketone was used to access the tetracyclic core of arborisidine. A strategic Peterson olefination through intramolecular nucleophile delivery was able to set up the exocyclic olefin of arboridinine.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterocycle/Heteroallene Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerization: Selective Catalysis Delivering Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;opening copolymerisation (ROCOP) is a powerful living polymerisation that yields numerous alternating copolymers with precisely placed heteroatoms in the polymer backbones. This Review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of this important method, describes the principles of the catalysis, and illustrates the potential of the different monomer combinations and resulting polymers. Trends and future challenges of this approach and the resulting materials are highlighted.







Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;containing polymers have strong potential as sustainable replacements for petrochemicals, show controllable monomer&#8211;polymer equilibria and properties spanning plastics, elastomers, fibres, resins, foams, coatings, adhesives, and self&#8208;assembled nanostructures. Their current and future applications span packaging, house&#8208;hold goods, clothing, automotive components, electronics, optical materials, sensors, and medical products. An interesting route to these polymers is the catalysed ring&#8208;opening copolymerisation (ROCOP) of heterocycles and heteroallenes. It is a living polymerization, occurs with high atom economy, and creates precise, new polymer structures inaccessible by traditional methods. In the last decade there has been a renaissance in research and increasing examples of commercial products made using ROCOP. It is better known in the production of polycarbonates and polyesters, but is also a powerful route to make N&#8208;, S&#8208;, and other heteroatom&#8208;containing polymers, including polyamides, polycarbamates, and polythioesters. This Review presents an overview of the different catalysts, monomer combinations, and polymer classes that can be accessed by heterocycle/heteroallene ROCOP.

         <title>The Anionic Pathway in the Nickel&#8208;Catalysed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assessment of the rich co&#8208;complexation chemistry of Ni(COD)2 and PhLi has led to a new family of structurally diverse lithium nickelates being uncovered. Combined stoichiometric, catalytic, and kinetic studies reveal that these hetero&#8208;bimetallic complexes may be the key intermediates that facilitate the smooth C&#8722;O bond cleavage and cross&#8208;coupling of aryl ethers under mild conditions.







Abstract
The Ni&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl ethers is a powerful method to forge new C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bonds. However, the inert C(sp2)&#8722;O bond means that a canonical mechanism that relies on the oxidative addition of the aryl ether to a Ni0 centre is thermodynamically and kinetically unfavourable, which suggests that alternative mechanisms may be involved. Here, we provide spectroscopic and structural insights into the anionic pathway, which relies on the formation of electron&#8208;rich hetero&#8208;bimetallic nickelates by adding organometallic nucleophiles to a Ni0 centre. Assessing the rich co&#8208;complexation chemistry between Ni(COD)2 and PhLi has led to the structures and solution&#8208;state chemistry of a diverse family of catalytically competent lithium nickelates being unveiled. In addition, we demonstrate dramatic solvent and donor effects, which suggest that the cooperative activation of the aryl ether substrate by Ni0&#8208;ate complexes plays a key role in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Light&#8208;Modulated Cationic and Anionic Transport across Protein Biopolymers**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently attaching photoacids and photobases to the surface of a polymer makes it possible to change the concentration of positive protons and negative hydroxides within the polymer upon irradiation with light. Such a change in charge carriers results in a light&#8208;modulated increase in the ionic conductivity across the polymer.







Abstract
Light is a convenient source of energy and the heart of light&#8208;harvesting natural systems and devices. Here, we show light&#8208;modulation of both the chemical nature and ionic charge carrier concentration within a protein&#8208;based biopolymer that was covalently functionalized with photoacids or photobases. We explore the capability of the biopolymer&#8208;tethered photoacids and photobases to undergo excited&#8208;state proton transfer and capture, respectively. Electrical measurements show that both the photoacid&#8208; and photobase&#8208;functionalized biopolymers exhibit an impressive light&#8208;modulated increase in ionic conductivity. Whereas cationic protons are the charge carriers for the photoacid&#8208;functionalized biopolymer, water&#8208;derived anionic hydroxides are the suggested charge carriers for the photobase&#8208;functionalized biopolymer. Our work introduces a versatile toolbox to photomodulate both protons and hydroxides as charge carriers in polymers, which can be of interest for a variety of applications.

         <title>Rational Selection of Cyanines to Generate Conjugate Acid and Free Radicals for Photopolymerization upon Exposure at 860&#8201;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substitution of cyanines with different terminal indolium groups and distinct polymethine chain directs the excited state either to deactivation by internal conversion (IC) or photochemistry resulting in the generation of initiating radicals for free&#8208;radical polymerization and conjugate acid for cationic polymerization an self&#8208;polyaddition of vinyl ether&#8197;M1.







Abstract
Different cyanines absorbing in the NIR between 750 and 930&#8197;nm were applied to study the efficiency of both radical and cationic polymerization in combination with diaryliodonium salt. Variation of the connecting methine chain and structure of the terminal indolium moiety provided a deeper insight in the structure of the cyanine NIR&#8208;sensitizer and the efficiency to generate initiating radicals and conjugate acid. Photophysical studies were pursued by fluorescence spectroscopy providing a deeper understanding regarding the lifetime of the excited state and contribution of nonradiative deactivation resulting in generation of additional heat in the polymerization process. Furthermore, electrochemical experiments demonstrated connection to oxidation and reduction capability as influenced by the structural pattern of the sensitizer. LC&#8211;MS measurements provided a deeper pattern about the photoproducts formed. A nonamethine&#8208;based cyanine showed the best performance regarding bleaching in combination with an iodonium salt at 860&#8197;nm.

         <title>Atomic Cation&#8208;Vacancy Engineering of NiFe&#8208;Layered Double Hydroxides for Improved Activity and Stability towards the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal dissolution induced by lattice distortions was found to be responsible for the activity degradation of NiFe&#8208;LDH catalysts during alkaline OER. This degradation could be suppressed by introducing atomic cation vacancies in the LDH basal plane. Cation vacancy engineering strengthened the binding energy between metal cations and oxygen in the LDH layers and reduced lattice distortions, thereby enhancing catalyst stability and promoting active phase &#947;&#8208;(NiFe)OOH evolution during OER.







Abstract
NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxides (NiFe&#8208;LDH) are among the most active catalysts developed to date for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, though their long&#8208;term OER stability remains unsatisfactory. Herein, we reveal that the stability degradation of NiFe&#8208;LDH catalysts during alkaline OER results from a decreased number of active sites and undesirable phase segregation to form NiOOH and FeOOH, with metal dissolution underpinning both of these deactivation mechanisms. Further, we demonstrate that the introduction of cation&#8208;vacancies in the basal plane of NiFe LDH is an effective approach for achieving both high catalyst activity and stability during OER. The strengthened binding energy between the metals and oxygen in the LDH sheets, together with reduced lattice distortions, both realized by the rational introduction of cation vacancies, drastically mitigate metal dissolution from NiFe&#8208;LDH under high oxidation potentials, resulting in the improved long&#8208;term OER stability. In addition, the cation vacancies (especially M3+ vacancies) accelerate the evolution of surface &#947;&#8208;(NiFe)OOH phases, thereby boosting the OER activity. The present study highlights that tailoring atomic cation&#8208;vacancies is an important strategy for the development of active and stable OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>In situ modulation of A&#8208;site vacancies in LaMnO3.15 perovskite for surface lattice oxygen activation and boosted redox reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulation of A&#8208;site defects is crucial to the redox reactions on ABO3  perovskites for both clean air application and electrochemical energy storage. Herein we report a scalable one&#8208;pot strategy for in situ regulation of La vacancies (V  La) in LaMnO3.15  by simply introducing urea in the traditional citrate process, and further reveal the fundamental relationship between  V  La  creation and surface lattice oxygen (Olatt  ) activation. The underlying mechanism is shortened Mn&#8208;O bonds, decreased orbital ordering, promoted MnO6  bending vibration and weakened Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, ultimately realizing enhanced Mn&#8208;3d and O&#8208;2p orbital hybridization.   The LaMnO3.15  with optimized  V  La  exhibits order of magnitude increase in toluene oxidation and ~0.05 V versus RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) increase of half&#8208;wave potential in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).  The reported simple but effective strategy for in situ modulation of La&#8208;site defects and the corresponding influence on the electronic structure of MnO6  can benefit the development of novel defect&#8208;meditated perovskites in both heterocatalysis and electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state zinc (Zn) batteries offer new desirable candidate for emerging applications sensitive to volume, safety and cost. However, current solid polymeric or ceramic electrolyte structures remain poorly conductive&#160;for the divalent Zn2+, especially at room temperature.

Herein, we split a new path to construct solid&#160; Zn2+&#8208;ion conductor via  inducing crystallization of tailored eutectic liquids&#160;formed by organic Zn salts and bipolar ligands. High&#8208;entropy eutectic&#8208;networks avail to&#160;weaken the ion&#8208;association and form interfacial&#160;Zn2+ percolated channels on the nucleator surfaces, resulting in a solid crystal with exceptional selectivity for&#160;Zn2+ transport (tZn2+ =&#160;0.64) and appreciable&#160;Zn2+ conductivity (&#963;Zn2+ = 3.84 &#215;&#8239;10&#8208;5 S&#8239;cm&#8208;1 at 30&#8239;&#176;C, over 2 orders of magnitude conventional polymers), and finally enabling practical ambient&#8208;temperature Zn/V2O5 metal solid cells.

However, its use in the field of on&#8208;surface synthesis is hampered by the spatial restrictions of this cycloaddition reaction. Herein we selected a cyclic strained triyne to demonstrate an on&#8208;surface hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction in a single molecule. The reaction was studied in detail by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with CO&#8208;functionalized tips. Our results pave the way to use this iconic pericyclic reaction for on&#8208;surface synthesis, introducing the concept of atom economy in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategy for Site&#8208; and Chemoselective C&#8211;H Alkenylation through Osmaelectrooxidative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we disclose osmaelectro&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activations that set the stage for electrooxidative alkyne annulations by benzoic acids. The osmium electrocatalysis enables site&#8208; and chemoselective electrooxidative C&#8211;H activations with unique levels of selectivities. The isolation of unprecedented osmium(0) and osmium(II) intermediates, along with crystallographic characterization and analyses by spectrometric and spectroscopic  in&#8208;operando  techniques delineate a synergistic osmium redox catalyst regime. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed a facile C&#8211;H cleavage, which allowed for ample substrate scope to provide robust and user&#8208;friendly access to annulated heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Installing a Green Engine to Drive an Enzyme Cascade: a Light&#8208;Powered in vitro Biosystem for Poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many existing in vitro  biosystems harness power from the chemical energy embedded in substrates, co&#8208;substrates, and light or electric energy provided from abiotic parts, causing the issue of compromising the atom economy, incompatibility between biological and abiotic parts, and most importantly, incapability to spatiotemporally co&#8208;regenerate ATP and NADPH. Herein, we develop a light&#8208;powered in vitro  biosystem for poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) synthesis using natural thylakoid membranes (TMs) to co&#8208;regenerate ATP and NADPH for a five&#8208;enzyme cascade. Through effective coupling of cofactor regeneration and mass conversion, 20 mM PHB from 50 mM sodium acetate was yielded with a molar conversion efficiency of carbon of 80.0 % and the light energy conversion efficiency of 3.04 %, much higher than efficiencies of similar in vitro  PHB synthesis biosystems. This suggests the promise of installing TMs as a green engine to drive more enzyme cascades.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying Mechanical Properties of Molecular Crystals: A Critical Overview of Experimental Elastic Tensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review presents a critical and comprehensive overview of current experimental measurements of complete elastic constant tensors for molecular crystals. For a large fraction of these molecular crystals detailed comparisons are made with elastic tensors obtained using the corrected small basis set Hartree&#8208;Fock method S&#8208;HF&#8208;3c, and these are shown to be competitive with many of those obtained from more sophisticated density functional theory plus dispersion (DFTD) approaches. These detailed comparisons between S&#8208;HF3c, experimental and DFT&#8208;D computed tensors make use of a novel rotation&#8208;invariant spherical harmonic description of the Young&#8217;s modulus, and identify outliers among sets of independent experimental results. The result is a curated database of experimental elastic tensors for molecular crystals, which we hope will stimulate more extensive use of elastic tensor information &#8208; experimental and computational &#8208; in studies aimed at correlating mechanical properties of molecular crystals with their underlying crystal structure. This is particularly relevant in current studies that exploit techniques such as nanoindentation and micro&#8208;focused mapping experiments on bent crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrene Photochemistry of Manganese N&#8208;Haloamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese complexes supported by macrocyclic tetrapyrrole ligands represent an important platform for nitrene transfer catalysis and have been applied to both C&#8211;H amination and olefin aziridination catalysis. The reactivity of the transient high&#8208;valent Mn nitrenoids that mediate these processes renders characterization of these species challenging. Here we report the synthesis and nitrene transfer photochemistry of a family of Mn(III)  N  &#8208;haloamide complexes. The  S  = 2  N  &#8208;haloamide complexes are characterized by  1  H NMR, UV&#8208;vis, IR, high&#8208;frequency and &#8208;field EPR (HFEPR) spectroscopies, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Photolysis of these complexes results in the formal transfer of a nitrene equivalent to both C&#8211;H bonds, such as the a&#8208;C&#8211;H bonds of tetrahydrofuran, and olefinic substrates, such as styrene, to afford aminated and aziridinated products, respectively. Low&#8208;temperature spectroscopy and analysis of kinetic isotope effects for C&#8211;H amination indicate halogen&#8208;dependent photoreactivity: Photolysis of  N  &#8208;chloroamides proceeds via initial cleavage of the Mn&#8211;N bond to generate Mn(II) and amidyl radical intermediates; in contrast, photolysis of  N  &#8208;iodoamides proceeds via N&#8211;I cleavage to generate a Mn(IV) nitrenoid (  i.e.  , {MnNR}  7  species). These results establish  N  &#8208;haloamide ligands as viable precursors in the photosynthesis of metal nitrenes and highlight the power of ligand design to provide access to reactive intermediates in group&#8208;transfer catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Heterogeneous Scandium Lewis Acid Catalysts for Continuous&#8208;Flow Enantioselective Friedel&#8211;Crafts Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond&#8208;Forming Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>While continuous&#8208;flow reactions with chiral heterogeneous catalysts provide a highly efficient method to synthesize optically active compounds, chiral heterogeneous Lewis acid catalysis has been less extensively explored. We have developed the first example of chiral heterogeneous Sc catalysts, which demonstrated excellent activity and selectivity for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective Friedel&#8211;Crafts reactions of isatins with indoles. Noncovalent interactions between chiral Sc complexes and heteropoly acid&#8208;anchored amine&#8208;functionalized SiO  2  as support were utilized for the synthesis. The heteropoly acid was found to be crucial for the preparation, activity, and selectivity of the catalysts. The chiral ligand could be easily tuned without chemical modification and the continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of a biologically active compound was achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>General Tolerance of Galactosyltransferases toward UDP&#8208;galactosamine Expands Their Synthetic Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accessing large numbers of structurally diverse glycans and derivatives is essential to functional glycomics. We showed a general tolerance of galactosyltransferases toward uridine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;galactosamine (UDP&#8208;GalN), which is not a commonly used sugar nucleotide donor. The property was harnessed to develop a two&#8208;step chemoenzymatic strategy for facile synthesis of novel and divergent N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)&#8208;glycosides and derivatives in preparative scales. The discovery and the application of the new property of existing glycosyltransferases expand their catalytic capabilities in generating novel carbohydrate linkages, thus prompting the synthesis of diverse glycans and glycoconjugates for biological studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Triggered Reversible Disassembly of an Engineered Protein Nanocage**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel protein nanocage has been developed capable of on&#8208;demand reversible disassembly via simple buffer exchanges under mild conditions. Data presented herein also show the nanocage is capable of in vivo and in vitro cargo loading, suggesting a broad range of possible applications in biocatalysis, bionanotechnology, and biomedicine. Additional findings include structure determination and protein design verification via cryo&#8208;electron microscopy.







Abstract
Protein nanocages play crucial roles in sub&#8208;cellular compartmentalization and spatial control in all domains of life and have been used as biomolecular tools for applications in biocatalysis, drug delivery, and bionanotechnology. The ability to control their assembly state under physiological conditions would further expand their practical utility. To gain such control, we introduced a peptide capable of triggering conformational change at a key structural position in the largest known encapsulin nanocompartment. We report the structure of the resulting engineered nanocage and demonstrate its ability to disassemble and reassemble on demand under physiological conditions. We demonstrate its capacity for in vivo encapsulation of proteins of choice while also demonstrating in vitro cargo loading capabilities. Our results represent a functionally robust addition to the nanocage toolbox and a novel approach for controlling protein nanocage disassembly and reassembly under mild conditions.

         <title>A Coral&#8208;Like FeP@NC Anode with Increasing Cycle Capacity for Sodium&#8208;Ion and Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Induced by Particle Refinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Refinement of FeP nanoparticles can result in a gradually increase in the graphitization degree and interface magnetization. Furthermore, it provides more active sites for Na+ storage and contributes to a rising capacity during cycling.







Abstract
We present a coral&#8208;like FeP composite with FeP nanoparticles anchored and dispersed on a nitrogen&#8208;doped 3D carbon framework (FeP@NC). Due to the highly continuous N&#8208;doped carbon framework and a spring&#8208;buffering graphitized carbon layer around the FeP nanoparticle, a sodium&#8208;ion battery with the FeP@NC composite exhibits an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 82.0&#8201;% in 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles. Also, particle refinement leads to a capacity increase during cycling. The FeP nanoparticles go through a refining&#8211;recombination process during the first cycle and present a global refining trend after dozens of cycles, which results in a gradually increase in graphitization degree and interface magnetization, and further provides more active sites for Na+ storage and contributes to a rising capacity with cycling. The capacity ascending phenomenon can also extend to lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Luminescent Metal&#8208;Phenolic Networks for Multicolor Particle Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular fluorescence labeling strategy is established using luminescent metal&#8208;phenolic networks constructed from metal ions, phenolic ligands, and dye molecules. Tunable and customized luminescence (e.g., red, blue, multichromatic, and white light) is achieved on inorganic, organic, and biological particles, with potential applications in the physical and life sciences.







Abstract
The development of fluorescence labeling techniques has attracted widespread interest in various fields, including biomedical science as it can facilitate high&#8208;resolution imaging and the spatiotemporal understanding of various biological processes. We report a supramolecular fluorescence labeling strategy using luminescent metal&#8208;phenolic networks (MPNs) constructed from metal ions, phenolic ligands, and common and commercially available dyes. The rapid labeling process (&lt;5&#8197;min) produces ultrathin coatings (&#8776;10&#8197;nm) on diverse particles (e.g., organic, inorganic, and biological entities) with customized luminescence (e.g., red, blue, multichromatic, and white light) simply through the selection of fluorophores. The fluorescent coatings are stable at pH values from 1 to 8 and in complex biological media owing to the dominant &#960; interactions between the dyes and MPNs. These coatings exhibit negligible cytotoxicity and their strong fluorescence is retained even when internalized into intracellular compartments. This strategy is expected to provide a versatile approach for fluorescence labeling with potential in diverse fields across the physical and life sciences.

         <title>Ambimodal Transition States in Diels&#8211;Alder Cycloadditions of Tropolone and Tropolonate with N&#8208;Methylmaleimide**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cycloaddition of tropolone with maleimide in the presence of weak base involves an ambimodal transition state that leads directly to both endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;adducts.







Abstract
The Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of tropolone and its conjugate base with N&#8208;methylmaleimide have been explored computationally and experimentally. Previous studies of the [4+2] cycloaddition under basic conditions show that both endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;products are obtained in similar, but variable amounts. Density functional theory (&#969;B97X&#8208;D) explorations of potential energy surfaces, and molecular dynamics trajectories show that the reaction involves an ambimodal transition state for the reaction of the ammonium tropolonate with N&#8208;methylmaleimide, and that similar amounts of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;products are obtained. The thermal reaction, studied experimentally in detail here for the first time, is predicted to form the endo&#8208;adduct through an ambimodal transition state. The exo&#8208;adduct can be formed from the same transition state, but requires a hydrogen shift, that hinders this reaction dynamically. Longer reaction times give a small excess of the exo&#8208;product, which is thermodynamically more stable.

         <title>Organophosphine&#8208;Sandwiched Copper Iodide Cluster Enables Charge Trapping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular n&#8208;p&#8208;n heterojunction based on biligand&#8208;sandwiched copper iodide nanocluster is constructed as charge trapper in ambipolar transistor memories featuring large memory windows and energy&#8208;saving operation. Spatial electronic anisotropy of the lamellar structure and steric and insulating effects of phosphine ligands effectively hinder intramolecular electronic communications, leading to the tunable and reliable charge trapping as a basis of real single&#8208;molecule devices.







Abstract
Herein, we report a feasible molecular design of the binuclear clusters featuring the n&#8208;p&#8208;n heterojunction of biligand&#8208;sandwiched inorganic units, which can be used as the effective charge trapper in ambipolar transistor memories with the large memory windows and the energy&#8208;saving operation. We found that the hole confinement on the p&#8208;type inorganic units is enhanced by spatial electronic anisotropy provided by the peripheral n&#8208;type organic phosphine ligands. The steric hindrance of the coordination sites, the insulating effect of the carbon&#8208;phosphorous single bonds and the parallel dual&#8208;ligand coordination mode jointly elongate the interunit distances to nanometer scale and restrain the intramolecular electronic communications, leading to the tunable and reliable charge trapping. Our results show that the spatial effect is crucial to further amplifying the electronic differences between organic and inorganic units for function enhancement.

         <title>Synergetic Cobalt&#8208;Copper&#8208;Based Bimetal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanoboxes toward Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient oxygen electrocatalysts and understanding their underlying catalytic mechanism are of significant importance for the high&#8208;performance energy conversion and storage technologies. Herein, we report novel CoCu&#8208;based bimetal&#8208;organic framework nanoboxes (CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs) as promising catalysts toward efficient electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER), fabricated via a successive cation and ligand exchange strategy. With the highly exposed bimetal centers and the well&#8208;designed architecture, the CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs show excellent OER activity and stability, with a small overpotential of 271 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  and a high turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.326 s  &#8208;1  at an overpotential of 300 mV. In combination of quasi in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density&#8208;functional theory calculations, the post&#8208;formed CoCu&#8208;based oxyhydroxide analogue during OER is believed to account for the high OER activity of CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs, where the electronic synergy between Co and neighbouring Cu atoms promotes the O&#8208;O bond coupling toward fast OER kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Genetically Programmable Fusion Cellular Vesicles for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effectively activating host immunity against cancer has already become a promising therapeutic strategy. However, cancer cells resist to the host immune response through both innate and adaptive immune effectors. Especially, CD47 on tumor cells protects them from macrophage phagocytosis through interaction with SIRP&#945;, while PD&#8208;L1 interacts with its receptor PD&#8208;1 and dampens T cell&#8208;mediated tumor killing. Herein, we report that genetically programmable fusion cellular vesicles (Fus&#8208;CVs) displaying high&#8208;affinity SIRP&#945; variants and PD&#8208;1 can disable both mechanisms. Dual&#8208;blockade of CD47 and PD&#8208;L1 with Fus&#8208;CVs significantly increases the phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages, promotes antigen presentation, and activates antitumor T&#8208;cell immunity. Moreover, the bispecific targeting design of Fus&#8208;CVs ensures better targeting on tumor cells, but less on other cells, which reduces systemic side effects and enhances therapeutic efficacies. In malignant melanoma and mammary carcinoma models, we demonstrate that Fus&#8208;CVs significantly improve overall survival of model animals by inhibiting post&#8208;surgery tumor recurrence and metastasis. The Fus&#8208;CVs are suitable for protein display by genetic engineering. These advantages, integrated with other unique properties inherited from source cells, make Fus&#8208;CVs an attractive platform for multi&#8208;targeting immune checkpoint blockade therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Ladder of Ni3 Complexes with Closed&#8208;Shell, Mono&#8208;, and Diradical Triphenylene Units: Molecular Models for Conductive 2D MOFs</title>

         <dc:description>
Spin coupling and electronic delocalization in trinickel clusters bridged by the radical&#8208;containing tritopic ligand 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaoxytriphenylene (HOTP) was investigated. The HOTP spin state and strength of Ni&#8208;HOTP magnetic coupling can be tuned by consecutive HOTP&#8208;centered redox processes. The results provide inspiration for the design of new molecular and solid&#8208;state magnetic and electrically conductive materials.







Abstract
We report the isolation and characterization of a series of trinickel complexes with 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaoxytriphenylene (HOTP), [(Me3TPANi)3(HOTP)](BF4)n (Me3TPA=N,N,N&#8208;tris[(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl)methyl]amine) (n=2, 3, 4 for complexes 1, 2, 3). These complexes comprise a redox ladder whereby the HOTP core displays increasingly quinoidal character as its formal oxidation state changes from &#8722;4, to &#8722;3, and &#8722;2 in 1, 2, and 3, respectively. No formal oxidation state changes occur on Ni, allowing the isolation of singlet diradical, monoradical, and closed&#8208;shell configurations for HOTP in 1, 2, and 3, respectively, with a concomitant decrease in the spin coupling strength upon oxidation. Because the three complexes can be considered models of the smallest building blocks of 2D conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks such as Ni9HOTP4, these results serve as possible inspiration for the construction of extended materials with targeted electric and magnetic properties.

         <title>Allosteric Switching of Calmodulin in a Mycobacterium smegmatis porin&#8197;A (MspA) Nanopore&#8208;Trap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23863-23870, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ca2+&#8208;free, Ca2+&#8208;bound, and target peptide&#8208;bound states of calmodulin were distinguished by Mycobacterium smegmatis porin&#8197;A (MspA). The D129G mutant of calmodulin was also discriminated. Interactions between calmodulin and other divalent ions were also detected, demonstrating high resolution structural profiling.







Abstract
Recent developments concerning large protein nanopores suggest a new approach to structure profiling of native folded proteins. In this work, the large vestibule of Mycobacterium smegmatis porin&#8197;A (MspA) and calmodulin (CaM), a Ca2+&#8208;binding protein, were used in the direct observation of the protein structure. Three conformers, including the Ca2+&#8208;free, Ca2+&#8208;bound, and target peptide&#8208;bound states of CaM, were unambiguously distinguished. A disease related mutant, CaM D129G was also discriminated by MspA, revealing how a single amino acid replacement can interfere with the Ca2+&#8208;binding capacity of the whole protein. The binding capacity and aggregation effect of CaM induced by different ions (Mg2+/Sr2+/Ba2+/Ca2+/Pb2+/Tb3+) were also investigated and the stability of MspA in extreme conditions was evaluated. This work demonstrates the most systematic single&#8208;molecule investigation of different allosteric conformers of CaM, acknowledging the high sensing resolution offered by the MspA nanopore trap.

         <title>A Desolvation&#8208;Free Sodium Dual&#8208;Ion Chemistry for High Power Density and Extremely Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23858-23862, October 25, 2021. </description>

A desolvation&#8208;free sodium dual&#8208;ion battery was fabricated by combining reversible anion doping in a polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) cathode and co&#8208;intercalation of a Na+&#8208;solvent complex in an artificial graphite (AG) anode, which demonstrates super&#8208;fast kinetics of 10&#8197;Ag&#8722;1 (100C&#8208;rate) at 25&#8201;&#176;C, maintaining 61&#8201;% at an ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C compared to its room&#8208;temperature capacity.







Abstract
The development of conventional rechargeable batteries based on intercalation chemistry in the fields of fast charge and low temperature is generally hindered by the sluggish cation&#8208;desolvation process at the electrolyte/electrode interphase. To address this issue, a novel desolvation&#8208;free sodium dual&#8208;ion battery (SDIB) has been proposed by using artificial graphite (AG) as anode and polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) as cathode. Combining the cation solvent co&#8208;intercalation and anion storage chemistry, such a SDIB operated with ether&#8208;based electrolyte can intrinsically eliminate the sluggish desolvation process. Hence, it can exhibit an extremely fast kinetics of 10&#8197;Ag&#8722;1 (corresponding to 100C&#8208;rate) with a high capacity retention of 45&#8201;%. Moreover, the desolvation&#8208;free mechanism endows the battery with 61&#8201;% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity at an ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C. This advanced battery system will open a door for designing energy storage devices that require high power density and a wide operational temperature range.

         <title>Aggregation of Gold Nanoparticles Triggered by Hydrogen Peroxide&#8208;Initiated Chemiluminescence for Activated Tumor Theranostics</title>

Taking advantage of the well&#8208;known tetrazole/alkene &#8220;photoclick&#8221; chemistry, a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)&#8208;initiated chemiluminescence&#8208;triggered nanoparticle (NP) aggregation strategy was herein reported to activate the photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapeutic functions of gold NPs for specific visualization and efficient treatment of tumors in&#8197;vivo. This approach could provide a valuable tool for achieving precise cancer treatment.







Abstract
Developing endogenous photo&#8208;activated theranostic platforms to overcome the limitation of low tissue&#8208;penetration from external light sources is highly significant for cancer diagnosis and treatment. We report a H2O2&#8208;initiated chemiluminescence (CL)&#8208;triggered nanoparticle aggregation strategy to activate theranostic functions of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for effective tumor imaging and therapy. Two types of AuNPs (tAuNP &amp; mAuNP) were designed and fabricated by conjugating 2,5&#8208;diphenyltetrazole and methacrylic acid onto the surface of AuNPs, respectively. Luminol was adsorbed onto the mAuNPs to afford self&#8208;illuminating mAuNP/Lu NPs that could produce strong CL by reaction with H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment, which triggers significant aggregation of AuNPs resulting in enhanced accumulation and retention of AuNPs for activated photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy of tumors. We thus believe that this approach may offer a promising tool for effective tumor treatment.

         <title>Neutrophil&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Probe Development through Metabolism&#8208;Oriented Live&#8208;Cell Distinction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23743-23749, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly lipophilic fluorescent probe, NeutropG, has been developed for the specific distinction and imaging of human neutrophils over other blood cell types. The staining mechanism of neutrophil&#8208;selective NeutropG is achieved by metabolism&#8208;oriented live&#8208;cell distinction (MOLD) through lipid droplet biogenesis. NeutropG enters a neutrophil transported by CD36, then forms a lipid droplet with the help of ACSL and DGAT.







Abstract
Human neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes and have been considered as the first line of defence in the innate immune system. Selective imaging of live neutrophils will facilitate the in&#8197;situ study of neutrophils in infection or inflammation events as well as clinical diagnosis. However, small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based probes for the discrimination of live neutrophils among different granulocytes in human blood have yet to be reported. Herein, we report the first fluorescent probe NeutropG for the specific distinction and imaging of active neutrophils. The selective staining mechanism of NeutropG is elucidated as metabolism&#8208;oriented live&#8208;cell distinction (MOLD) through lipid droplet biogenesis with the help of ACSL and DGAT. Finally, NeutropG is applied to accurately quantify neutrophil levels in fresh blood samples by showing a high correlation with the current clinical method.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Fungal Drimane&#8208;Type Sesquiterpene Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23763-23770, October 25, 2021. </description>

Reported here is the complete elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpene esters from Aspergillus calidoustus, including the first identified fungal drimenol cyclase. The cluster&#8208;associated acyltransferase is then employed to transfer different lengths of ACP&#8208;activated polyketides, but also very diverse CoA&#8208;esters.







Abstract
Drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes exhibit various biological activities and are widely present in eukaryotes. Here, we completely elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of the drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpene esters isolated from Aspergillus calidoustus and we discovered that it involves a drimenol cyclase having the same catalytic function previously only reported in plants. Moreover, since many fungal drimenol derivatives possess a &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone ring, we clarified the functions of the cluster&#8208;associated cytochrome P450 and FAD&#8208;binding oxidoreductase discovering that these two enzymes are solely responsible for the formation of those structures. Furthermore, swapping of the enoyl reductase domain in the identified polyketide synthase led to the production of metabolites containing various polyketide chains with different levels of saturation. These findings have deepened our understanding of how fungi synthesize drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes and the corresponding esters.

         <title>Interfacial Linkage and Carbon Encapsulation Enable Full Solution&#8208;Printed Perovskite Photovoltaics with Prolonged Lifespan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23735-23742, October 25, 2021. </description>

A simple amphiphilic silane interfacial linkage strategy was employed to realize fully&#8208;printed all carbon&#8208;based perovskite photovoltaics, achieving a high efficiency of 18.64&#8201;%, accompanied by excellent device stability over 3000 hours.







Abstract
Simplified perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with the perovskite layer sandwiched and encapsulated between carbon&#8208;based electron transport layer (ETL) and counter electrode (CE) by a fully blade&#8208;coated process. A self&#8208;assembled monolayer of amphiphilic silane (AS) molecules on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate appeals to the fullerene ETL deposition and preserves its integrity against the solvent damage. The AS serves as a &#8220;molecular glue&#8221; to strengthen the adhesion toughness at the TCO/ETL interface via robust chemical interaction and bonding, facilitating the interfacial charge extraction, increasing PCEs by 77&#8201;% and reducing hysteresis. A PCE of 18.64&#8201;% was achieved for the fully printed devices, one of the highest reported for carbon&#8208;based PSCs.

     alt="Interfacial Linkage and Carbon Encapsulation Enable Full Solution-Printed Perovskite Photovoltaics with Prolonged Lifespan"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple amphiphilic silane interfacial linkage strategy was employed to realize fully-printed all carbon-based perovskite photovoltaics, achieving a high efficiency of 18.64&#8201;%, accompanied by excellent device stability over 3000 hours.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplified perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with the perovskite layer sandwiched and encapsulated between carbon-based electron transport layer (ETL) and counter electrode (CE) by a fully blade-coated process. A self-assembled monolayer of amphiphilic silane (AS) molecules on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate appeals to the fullerene ETL deposition and preserves its integrity against the solvent damage. The AS serves as a &#8220;molecular glue&#8221; to strengthen the adhesion toughness at the TCO/ETL interface via robust chemical interaction and bonding, facilitating the interfacial charge extraction, increasing PCEs by 77&#8201;% and reducing hysteresis. A PCE of 18.64&#8201;% was achieved for the fully printed devices, one of the highest reported for carbon-based PSCs. AS-assisted interfacial linkage and carbon-material-assisted self-encapsulation enhance the stability of the PSCs, which did not experience performance degradation when stored at ambient conditions for over 3000&#8197;h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zeolite&#8208;Tailored Active Site Proximity for the Efficient Production of Pentanoic Biofuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23713-23721, October 25, 2021. </description>

Zeolite&#8208;tailored active site proximity, with well&#8208;dispersed and ultra&#8208;small Ru nanoclusters (ca. 1&#8197;nm) confined within the internal cavities of zeolite&#8197;Y, significantly boosts the catalytic activity and selectivity for the direct hydrodeoxygenation of neat ethyl levulinate into pentanoic biofuels. Furthermore, La modification for zeolite&#8197;Y could improve the metal dispersion and the stability of zeolite during catalysis.







Abstract
Biofuel production can alleviate reliance on fossil resources and thus carbon dioxide emission. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) refers collectively to a series of important biorefinery processes to produce biofuels. Here, well&#8208;dispersed and ultra&#8208;small Ru metal nanoclusters (ca. 1&#8197;nm), confined within the micropores of zeolite&#8197;Y, provide the required active site intimacy, which significantly boosts the chemoselectivity towards the production of pentanoic biofuels in the direct, one&#8208;pot HDO of neat ethyl levulinate. Crucial for improving catalyst stability is the addition of La, which upholds the confined proximity by preventing zeolite lattice deconstruction during catalysis. We have established and extended an understanding of the &#8220;intimacy criterion&#8221; in catalytic biomass valorization. These findings bring new understanding of HDO reactions over confined proximity sites, leading to potential application for pentanoic biofuels in biomass conversion.

         <title>Energy Migration Control of Multimodal Emissions in an Er3+&#8208;Doped Nanostructure for Information Encryption and Deep&#8208;Learning Decoding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23790-23796, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The control of multimodal emissions has been demonstrated by a new type of Er3+&#8208;based lanthanide nanocrystals (NCs). The multiresponse color&#8208;switchable output can be used for information security. Based on the Vis/NIR&#8208;II multimodal emissions of these NCs and deep learning, it was possible to store and decode information in pork tissue by irradiation with visible light.







Abstract
Modulating the emission wavelengths of materials has always been a primary focus of fluorescence technology. Nanocrystals (NCs) doped with lanthanide ions with rich energy levels can produce a variety of emissions at different excitation wavelengths. However, the control of multimodal emissions of these ions has remained a challenge. Herein, we present a new composition of Er3+&#8208;based lanthanide NCs with color&#8208;switchable output under irradiation with 980, 808, or 1535&#8197;nm light for information security. The variation of excitation wavelengths changes the intensity ratio of visible (Vis)/near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emissions. Taking advantage of the Vis/NIR&#8208;II multimodal emissions of NCs and deep learning, we successfully demonstrated the storage and decoding of visible light information in pork tissue.

         <title>Second&#8208;Sphere Interaction Promoted Turn&#8208;On Fluorescence for Selective Sensing of Organic Amines in a TbIII&#8208;based Macrocyclic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23705-23712, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modulation of both primary and secondary coordination spheres of TbIII in Ln&#8208;MOFs led to turn&#8208;on sensing of organic analytes regardless of quenching oscillators. The presence of such a remote interaction mechanism during the turn&#8208;on sensing event was verified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and molecular dynamic modelling investigations.







Abstract
Guided by a second&#8208;sphere interaction strategy, we fabricated a Tb(III)&#8208;based metal&#8212;organic framework (MMCF&#8208;4) for turn&#8208;on sensing of methyl amine with ultra&#8208;low detection limit and high turn&#8208;on efficiency. MMCF&#8208;4 features lanthanide nodes shielded in a nonacoordinate geometry along with secondary coordination spheres that are densely populated with H&#8208;bond interacting sites. Nonradiative routes were inhibited by binding&#8208;induced rigidification of the ligand on the second coordination sphere, resulting in luminescence amplification. Such remote interacting mechanism involved in the turn&#8208;on sensing event was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular dynamic simulation studies. The design of both primary and secondary coordination spheres of Tb(III) enabled the first turn&#8208;on sensing of organic amines in aqueous conditions. Our work suggests a promising strategy for high&#8208;performance turn&#8208;on sensing for Ln&#8208;MOFs and luminous materials driven by other metal chromophores.

A deep learning&#8208;based voltammetric (DLV) sensing platform is developed for highly selective and multiplexed analysis of neurochemicals in&#8197;vivo. With the DLV sensor, we reveal the interplay between the concentrations of dopamine, ascorbate, and ions in the living rat brain, which is unobtainable with existing methods. Our strategy provides a powerful means to expedite basic research in neuroscience and empower sensing&#8208;aided diagnostic applications.







Abstract
Numerous neurochemicals have been implicated in the modulation of brain function, making them appealing analytes for sensors and diagnostics. However, it is a grand challenge to selectively measure multiple neurochemicals simultaneously in&#8197;vivo because of their great variations in concentrations, dynamic nature, and composition. Herein, we present a deep learning&#8208;based voltammetric sensing platform for the highly selective and simultaneous analysis of three neurochemicals in a living animal brain. The system features a carbon fiber electrode capable of capturing the mixed dynamics of a neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, and ions. Then a powerful deep neural network is employed to resolve individual chemical and spatial&#8208;temporal information. With this, a single electrochemical measurement reveals an interplaying concentration changes of dopamine, ascorbate, and ions in living rat brain, which is unobtainable with existing analytical methodologies. Our strategy provides a powerful means to expedite research in neuroscience and empower sensing&#8208;aided diagnostic applications.

The idea of using a molecular brake in materials science to precisely control the formation of assemblies in living cells is introduced. A tyrosine protection strategy enables the enzymatic cleavage site to be unmasked selectively by hydrolysis in the acidic environment of the lysosome. Cleavage of the P&#8722;N bond releases phosphotyrosine and enables enzyme&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly inside living cells spatiotemporally.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal control of chemical assembly in living cells remains challenging. We have now developed an efficient and general platform to precisely control the formation of assemblies in living cells. We introduced an O&#8208;[bis(dimethylamino)phosphono]tyrosine protection strategy in the self&#8208;assembly motif as the Trojan horse, whereby the programmed precursors resist hydrolysis by phosphatases on and inside cells because the unmasking of the enzymatic cleavage site occurs selectively in the acidic environment of lysosomes. After demonstrating the multistage self&#8208;assembly processes in&#8197;vitro by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS), cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM), and circular dichroism (CD), we investigated the formation of site&#8208;specific self&#8208;assembly in living cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), LC&#8208;MS, and biological electron microscopy (Bio&#8208;EM). Controlling chemical assembly in living systems spatiotemporally may have applications in supramolecular chemistry, materials science, synthetic biology, and chemical biology.

         <title>Rational Design of Sustainable Liquid Microcapsules for Spontaneous Fragrance Encapsulation</title>

The use of a PEG&#8208;g&#8208;PVAc amphiphilic graft copolymer together with hydrophobic fragrances in aqueous medium leads to the spontaneous formation of colloidally stable suspensions of liquid coacervate droplets. Arrows indicate the local turbulences sustaining the spontaneous mixing of the components. The bottom panel shows the confocal Raman microspectroscopy mapping of a multicompartment coacervate droplet with carvone as fragrance.







Abstract
The high volatility, water&#8208;immiscibility, and light/oxygen&#8208;sensitivity of most aroma compounds represent a challenge to their incorporation in liquid consumer products. Current encapsulation methods entail the use of petroleum&#8208;based materials, initiators, and crosslinkers as well as mixing, heating, and purification steps. Hence, more efficient and eco&#8208;friendly approaches to encapsulation must be sought. Herein, we propose a simple method by making use of a pre&#8208;formed amphiphilic polymer and employing the Hansen Solubility Parameters approach to determine which fragrances could be encapsulated by spontaneous coacervation in water. The coacervates do not precipitate as solids but they remain suspended as colloidally stable liquid microcapsules, as demonstrated by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The effective encapsulation of fragrance is proven through confocal Raman spectroscopy, while the structure of the capsules is investigated by means of cryo FIB/SEM, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering.

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Dominated Stable N97 Respirators for Airborne Virus Capture Based on Nanofibrous Membranes</title>

A polarity&#8208;driven air filtration approach is achieved based on the thin&#8208;film coated PAN nanofibrous membranes (TFPNMs), possessing a superior filtration efficiency reaching to N97 grade with outstanding longevity and reusability compared with the N95 FFRs. The TFPNMs can be reused upon various disinfection treatments, giving great potential for personal health care.







Abstract
The longevity and reusability of N95&#8208;grade filtering facepiece respirators (N95 FFRs) are limited by consecutive donning and disinfection treatments. Herein, we developed stable N97 nanofibrous respirators based on chemically modified surface to enable remarkable filtration characteristics via polarity driven interaction. This was achieved by a thin&#8208;film coated polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous membrane (TFPNM), giving an overall long&#8208;lasting filtration performance with high quality factor at 0.42&#8197;Pa&#8722;1 (filtration efficiency: over 97&#8201;%; pressure drop: around 10&#8197;Pa), which is higher than that of the commercial N95 FFRs (0.10&#8211;0.41&#8197;Pa&#8722;1) tested with a flow rate of 5&#8197;L&#8201;min&#8722;1 and the 0.26&#8197;&#956;m NaCl aerosol. A coxsackie B4 virus filtration test demonstrated that TFPNM also had strong virus capture capacity of 97.67&#8201;%. As compared with N95 FFRs, the TFPNM was more resistant to a wider variety of disinfection protocols, and the overall filtration characteristics remained N97 standard.

         <title>Pyrrole Hemithioindigo Antimitotics with Near&#8208;Quantitative Bidirectional Photoswitching that Photocontrol Cellular Microtubule Dynamics with Single&#8208;Cell Precision**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23695-23704, October 25, 2021. </description>

Pyrrole hemithioindigos can be near&#8208;quantitatively photoisomerised by the laser wavelengths available on confocal microscopes. The first pyrrole hemithioindigo&#8208;based photopharmaceuticals, PHTubs, which are photoswitchable tubulin inhibitors, have been developed. PHTubs optically inhibit microtubule dynamics in live cells with single&#8208;cell, second&#8208;scale spatiotemporal precision, with both lit&#8208;active and dark&#8208;active compounds demonstrated in action.







Abstract
We report the first cellular application of the emerging near&#8208;quantitative photoswitch pyrrole hemithioindigo, by rationally designing photopharmaceutical PHTub inhibitors of the cytoskeletal protein tubulin. PHTubs allow simultaneous visible&#8208;light imaging and photoswitching in live cells, delivering cell&#8208;precise photomodulation of microtubule dynamics, and photocontrol over cell cycle progression and cell death. This is the first acute use of a hemithioindigo photopharmaceutical for high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution biological control in live cells. It additionally demonstrates the utility of near&#8208;quantitative photoswitches, by enabling a dark&#8208;active design to overcome residual background activity during cellular photopatterning. This work opens up new horizons for high&#8208;precision microtubule research using PHTubs and shows the cellular applicability of pyrrole hemithioindigo as a valuable scaffold for photocontrol of a range of other biological targets.

         <title>Engineering Dirhodium Artificial Metalloenzymes for Diazo Coupling Cascade Reactions**

Directed evolution was used to improve dirhodium metalloenzyme (ArM)&#8208;catalyzed diazo cross&#8208;coupling yield and selectivity. The ArM was then used in cascade reactions where the alkene product was reduced by an ene reductase, with the ArM scaffold controlling chemoselectivity in the reaction mixture. MD simulations show that the cofactor modulates the domain dynamics and favors a more closed, hydrophobic pocket conducive to selective catalysis.







Abstract
Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) are commonly used to control the stereoselectivity of catalytic reactions, but controlling chemoselectivity remains challenging. In this study, we engineer a dirhodium ArM to catalyze diazo cross&#8208;coupling to form an alkene that, in a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction, is reduced to an alkane with high enantioselectivity (typically &gt;99&#8201;% ee) by an alkene reductase. The numerous protein and small molecule components required for the cascade reaction had minimal effect on ArM catalysis. Directed evolution of the ArM led to improved yields and E/Z selectivities for a variety of substrates, which translated to cascade reaction yields. MD simulations of ArM variants were used to understand the structural role of the cofactor on ArM conformational dynamics. These results highlight the ability of ArMs to control both catalyst stereoselectivity and chemoselectivity to enable reactions in complex media that would otherwise lead to undesired side reactions.

         <title>Photoinduced Radical Emission in a Coassembly System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23842-23848, October 25, 2021. </description>

Coassembly systems are formed by doping carbonyl compounds into polyvinyl alcohol. After light irradiation the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network stabilizes the free radicals generated for the carbonyl compounds, leading to strong free&#8208;radical emission. Light/heat&#8208;controlled information encryption using these systems is demonstrated.







Abstract
Developing radical emission at ambient conditions is a challenging task since radical species are unstable in air. In the present work, we overcome this challenge by coassembling a series of tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzene molecules with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The strong hydrogen bonds between the guest dopants and the PVA host matrix protect the free radicals of carbonyl compounds after light irradiation, leading to strong solid state free radical emission. Changing temperature and peripheral functional groups of the tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzenes can influence the intensity of the radical emission. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations predict that such free radical fluorescence originates from anti&#8208;Kasha D2&#8594;D0 vertical emission by the anion radicals. The photoinduced radical emission by the tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzenes was successfully utilized for information encryption application.

         <title>Inside a Shell&#8212;Organometallic Catalysis Inside Encapsulin Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23835-23841, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal catalysis strategy has been developed inside a confined space using encapsulins equipped with HaloTag and [CpRu(hydroxyquinoline)(allyl)]PF6. The strategy opens up a toolbox for designing compartmentalized &#8220;new&#8208;to&#8208;biology&#8221; reactions inside living cells.







Abstract
Compartmentalization of chemical reactions inside cells are a fundamental requirement for life. Encapsulins are self&#8208;assembling protein&#8208;based nanocompartments from the prokaryotic repertoire that present a highly attractive platform for intracellular compartmentalization of chemical reactions by design. Using single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer and 3D&#8208;MINFLUX analysis, we analyze fluorescently labeled encapsulins on a single&#8208;molecule basis. Furthermore, by equipping these capsules with a synthetic ruthenium catalyst via covalent attachment to a non&#8208;native host protein, we are able to perform in&#8197;vitro catalysis and go on to show that engineered encapsulins can be used as hosts for transition metal catalysis inside living cells in confined space.

         <title>Strategies to Avoid Artifacts in Mass Spectrometry&#8208;Based Epitranscriptome Analyses</title>

For discovery of novel RNA modifications, a stringent workflow for structure validation is necessary to avoid misinterpretation of artifacts. The comparison of the synthetic standard to the native compound's retention time, full mass spectrum, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrum and metabolic isotope labeling allow for confident identification of RNA modifications.







Abstract
In this report, we perform structure validation of recently reported RNA phosphorothioate (PT) modifications, a new set of epitranscriptome marks found in bacteria and eukaryotes including humans. By comparing synthetic PT&#8208;containing diribonucleotides with native species in RNA hydrolysates by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (MS), metabolic stable isotope labeling, and PT&#8208;specific iodine&#8208;desulfurization, we disprove the existence of PTs in RNA from E. coli, S. cerevisiae, human cell lines, and mouse brain. Furthermore, we discuss how an MS artifact led to the initial misidentification of 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methylated diribonucleotides as RNA phosphorothioates. To aid structure validation of new nucleic acid modifications, we present a detailed guideline for MS analysis of RNA hydrolysates, emphasizing how the chosen RNA hydrolysis protocol can be a decisive factor in discovering and quantifying RNA modifications in biological samples.

         <title>Dissection of the Polar and Non&#8208;Polar Contributions to Aromatic Stacking Interactions in Solution</title>

A double&#8208;Hammett approach has been used to dissect out the polar contributions to the total aromatic stacking energy.







Abstract
Aromatic stacking interactions have been a matter of study and debate due to their crucial role in chemical and biological systems. The strong dependence on orientation and solvent together with the relatively small interaction energies have made evaluation and rationalization a challenge for experimental and theoretical chemists. We have used a supramolecular cage formed by two tris(pyridylmethyl)amines units to build chemical Double Mutant Cycles (DMC) for the experimental measurement of the free energies of &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. Extrapolating the substituent effects to remove the contribution due to electrostatic interactions reveals that there is a substantial contribution to the measured stacking interaction energies which is due to non&#8208;polar interactions (&#8722;3 to &#8722;6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The perfectly flat nature of the surface of an aromatic ring gives &#960;&#8208;stacking an inherent advantage over non&#8208;polar interactions with alkyl groups and accounts for the wide&#8208;spread prevalence of stacking interactions in Nature.

         <title>Simultaneously Enhanced Reverse Intersystem Crossing and Radiative Decay in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorophors with Multiple Through&#8208;space Charge Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23771-23776, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed fluorescent molecules with ortho&#8208;linked multiple donor&#8211;acceptor motifs are constructed to realize both fast radiative decay and reverse intersystem crossing, thanks to the enhanced multiple&#8208;charge transfers and near&#8208;degenerate excited states. The optimized device exhibits narrow&#8208;band green electroluminescence with a EQEmax/CIEy of 31.6&#8201;%/0.69, being the purest green bottom&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with through&#8208;space charge transfers (CT) have attracted particularly interest recently. However, the slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and radiative decay always limit their electroluminescence performances. Herein, TADF molecules with ortho&#8208;linked multiple donors&#8208;acceptor (ortho&#8208;Dn&#8208;A) motif are developed to create near&#8208;degenerate excited states for the reinforcement of spin&#8208;orbit coupling. The incorporation of both through&#8208;bond and through&#8208;space CT enlarges oscillator strength. The optimal ortho&#8208;D3&#8208;A compound exhibits a photoluminescence quantum yield of ca. 100&#8201;%, a high RISC rate of 2.57&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1 and a high radiative decay rate of 1.00&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1 simultaneously. With this compound as the sensitizer, a TADF&#8208;sensitized&#8208;fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode shows a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.6&#8201;% with an ultrapure green Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage y coordinate value of 0.69.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Composites with Ordered Macropores and Hollow Walls</title>

Cobalt/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts with 3D&#8208;ordered macroporous and hollow&#8208;wall structures were successfully fabricated by using ordered macroporous ZIF&#8208;8@ZIF&#8208;67 single crystals as precursors. This unique porous structure can greatly enhance mass transfer and accessibility of active sites to boost catalytic activity in the selective hydrogenation of furfural.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks provide versatile templates for the fabrication of various metal/carbon materials, but most of the derived composites possess only microspores, limiting the accessibility of embedded active sites. Herein, we report the construction of cobalt/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon composites with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ordered macroporous and hollow&#8208;wall structure (H&#8208;3DOM&#8208;Co/NC) using a single&#8208;crystal ordered macropore (SOM)&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8@ZIF&#8208;67 as precursor. During the pyrolysis, the interconnected macroporous structure of SOM&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8@ZIF&#8208;67 is mostly preserved, whereas the pore wall achieves a solid&#8208;to&#8208;hollow transformation with Co nanoparticles formed in the hollow walls. The 3D&#8208;ordered macroporous carbon skeleton may effectively promote long&#8208;range mass transfer and the hollow wall can facilitate local accessibility of active sites. This unique structure can greatly boost its catalytic activity in the selective hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived furfural to cyclopentanol, much superior to its counterparts without this well&#8208;designed hierarchically porous structure.

         <title>Identification of RNA Base Pairs and Complete Assignment of Nucleobase Resonances by Proton&#8208;Detected Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy at 100&#8197;kHz MAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23903-23910, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed solid&#8208;state NMR experiments to detect base pair patterns in RNA. The experiments use high&#8208;sensitivity 1H&#8208;detection and allow site&#8208;specific assignment of base pairs to individual nucleotide spin&#8208;systems. In addition, the experiments yield full assignment of nucleobase resonances. The methodology is applicable to RNA embedded in particles of any size and provides rapid access to RNA secondary structure in biological complexes.







Abstract
Knowledge of RNA structure, either in isolation or in complex, is fundamental to understand the mechanism of cellular processes. Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) is applicable to high molecular&#8208;weight complexes and does not require crystallization; thus, it is well&#8208;suited to study RNA as part of large multicomponent assemblies. Recently, we solved the first structures of both RNA and an RNA&#8208;protein complex by ssNMR using conventional 13C&#8208; and 15N&#8208;detection. This approach is limited by the severe overlap of the RNA peaks together with the low sensitivity of multidimensional experiments. Here, we overcome the limitations in sensitivity and resolution by using 1H&#8208;detection at fast MAS rates. We develop experiments that allow the identification of complete nucleobase spin&#8208;systems together with their site&#8208;specific base pair pattern using sub&#8208;milligram quantities of one uniformly labelled RNA sample. These experiments provide rapid access to RNA secondary structure by ssNMR in protein&#8208;RNA complexes of any size.

Maleic acid derivatives are studied as cysteine&#8208;selective reagents for protein labelling with comparable kinetics and superior stability to existing reagents. A novel mechanism is described to readily access stable chloro&#8208;maleamic acid. The mild conditions, fast kinetics, and irreversible conjugation make this method an appealing alternative to existing cysteine&#8208;targeted methods.







Abstract
We describe maleic&#8208;acid derivatives as robust cysteine&#8208;selective reagents for protein labelling with comparable kinetics and superior stability relative to maleimides. Diamide and amido&#8208;ester derivatives proved to be efficient protein&#8208;labelling species with a common mechanism in which a spontaneous cyclization occurs upon addition to cysteine. Introduction of chlorine atoms in their structures triggers ring hydrolysis or further conjugation with adjacent residues, which results in conjugates that are completely resistant to retro&#8208;Michael reactions in the presence of biological thiols and human plasma. By controlling the microenvironment of the reactive site, we can control selectivity towards the hydrolytic pathway, forming homogeneous conjugates. The method is applicable to several scaffolds and enables conjugation of different payloads. The synthetic accessibility of these reagents and the mild conditions required for fast and complete conjugation together with the superior stability of the conjugates make this strategy an important alternative to maleimides in bioconjugation.

A combination of charge density measurements, solid&#8208;state NMR 1JNC couplings, and DFT calculations is presented to characterise the transition from an n&#8211;&#960;* interaction to bond formation for a series of model crystalline peri&#8208;substituted naphthalenes.







Abstract
A combination of charge density studies and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 1JNC coupling measurements supported by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to characterise the transition from an n&#8211;&#960;* interaction to bond formation between a nucleophilic nitrogen atom and an electrophilic sp2 carbon atom in a series of crystalline peri&#8208;substituted naphthalenes. As the N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C distance reduces there is a sharp decrease in the Laplacian derived from increasing charge density between the two groups at ca. N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C = 1.8&#8197;&#197;, with the periodic DFT calculations predicting, and heteronuclear spin&#8208;echo NMR measurements confirming, the 1JNC couplings of &#8776;3&#8211;6&#8197;Hz for long C&#8722;N bonds (1.60&#8211;1.65&#8197;&#197;), and 1JNC couplings of &lt;1&#8197;Hz for N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C &gt;2.1&#8197;&#197;.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Stereoselective Barton&#8211;Kellogg Olefination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23911-23916, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented thiiranation controlled by chiral dirhodium catalysts combined with a highly stereospecific thiirane reduction render the versatile Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination a stereoselective process (see scheme). The fourfold stereogenicity of pertinent overcrowded alkenes was thereby tractable with divergent stereocontrol, thus enabling access to all four stereoisomers from identical substrates.







Abstract
Overcrowded alkenes are expeditiously prepared by the versatile Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination and have remarkable applications as functional molecules owing to their unique stereochemical features. The induced stereodynamics thereby enable the controlled motion of molecular switches and motors, while the high configurational stability prevents undesired isomeric scrambling. Bistricyclic aromatic enes are prototypical overcrowded alkenes with outstanding stereochemical properties, but their stereocontrolled preparation was thus far only feasible in stereospecific reactions and with chiral auxiliaries.

     alt="Catalyst-Controlled Stereoselective Barton&#8211;Kellogg Olefination"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unprecedented thiiranation controlled by chiral dirhodium catalysts combined with a highly stereospecific thiirane reduction render the versatile Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination a stereoselective process (see scheme). The fourfold stereogenicity of pertinent overcrowded alkenes was thereby tractable with divergent stereocontrol, thus enabling access to all four stereoisomers from identical substrates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcrowded alkenes are expeditiously prepared by the versatile Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination and have remarkable applications as functional molecules owing to their unique stereochemical features. The induced stereodynamics thereby enable the controlled motion of molecular switches and motors, while the high configurational stability prevents undesired isomeric scrambling. Bistricyclic aromatic enes are prototypical overcrowded alkenes with outstanding stereochemical properties, but their stereocontrolled preparation was thus far only feasible in stereospecific reactions and with chiral auxiliaries. Herein we report that direct catalyst control is achieved by a stereoselective Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination with enantio- and diastereocontrol for various bistricyclic aromatic enes. Using Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-PTAD)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as catalyst, several diazo compounds were selectively coupled with a thioketone to give one of the four &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-folded overcrowded alkene stereoisomers upon reduction. Complete stereodivergence was reached by catalyst control in combination with distinct thiirane reductions to provide all four stereoisomers with e.r. values of up to 99:1. We envision that this strategy will enable the synthesis of topologically unique overcrowded alkenes for functional materials, catalysis, energy- and electron transfer, and bioactive compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Krypton difluoride and [XeF][AsF6] react in HF solvent at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C to yield the first mixed KrII/XeII compound, [FKrFXeF][AsF6]&#8901;0.5&#8201;KrF2&#8901;2&#8201;HF. The structure and bonding of [FKrFXeF]+ were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations (ELF, AIM, NBO, and MEPS analyses). Upon warming, the compound undergoes redox decomposition in HF to yield mixed KrII/XeIV and KrII/XeVI species.







Abstract
Reaction of [XeF][AsF6] with excess KrF2 at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C in anhydrous HF (aHF) solvent has yielded the first mixed KrII/XeII noble&#8208;gas compound, [FKrFXeF][AsF6] &#8901;0.5&#8201;KrF2&#8901;2&#8201;HF, a salt of the [FKrFXeF]+ cation. The potent oxidative fluorinating properties of KrII fluoride species resulted in oxidation of XeII to XeIV in aHF at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C to form the mixed KrII/XeIV cocrystals, ([Kr2F3][AsF6])2&#8901;XeF4 and XeF4&#8901;KrF2. Further decomposition at 22&#8201;&#176;C resulted in oxidation of XeIV to XeVI to give the recently reported KrII/XeVI complexes, [F5Xe(FKrF)n][AsF6] (n=1, 2), [F5Xe][AsF6], and a new KrII/XeVI complex, [(F5Xe)2(&#956;&#8208;FKrF)(AsF6)2], which was characterized by low&#8208;temperature (LT) Raman spectroscopy. The [FKrFXeF][AsF6]&#8901;0.5&#8201;KrF2&#8901;2&#8201;HF, ([Kr2F3][AsF6])2&#8901;XeF4&#8201;, and XeF4&#8901;KrF2 compounds were characterized by LT Raman spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were used to assess the bonding in [FKrFXeF]+, [Kr2F3]+, and [Xe2F3]+ and to aid in their vibrational assignments.

         <title>An Air&#8208; and Water&#8208;Stable B4N4&#8208;Heteropentalene Serving as a Host Material for a Phosphorescent OLED</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23812-23818, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene (see structure) featuring a large HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap was synthesized and found to exhibit excellent thermal and chemical stability. The compound has a high T1 energy and can therefore emit short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence comparable to that of benzene. Owing to its photophysical properties, the B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene served as a good host material for a phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Replacement of the carbon&#8211;carbon bonds of antiaromatic compounds with polar boron&#8211;nitrogen bonds often provides isoelectronic BN compounds with excellent thermodynamic stability and interesting photophysical properties. By this element&#8208;substitution strategy, we synthesized a new B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene derivative, 1, which is fully substituted with mesityl groups. Owing to kinetic protection by the sterically bulky substituents, 1 is remarkably stable toward air and even water. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of 1 revealed the bonding characteristics of the B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene structure. In a glassy matrix, 1 emitted short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence with an onset at 350&#8197;nm, indicating that the triplet energy is substantially high. DFT calculations reasonably explained the ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state electronic structures of 1 as well as its emission properties. Motivated by the high&#8208;energy triplet state of 1, we used it as a host material to fabricate a phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode with an external quantum efficiency of 15&#8201;%.

A one&#8208;pot catalytic and scalable Knoevenagel/asymmetric epoxidation/domino ring&#8208;opening cyclization (DROC) strategy towards medicinally significant dihydroquinoxalinones, featuring 1&#8208;phenylsulfonyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyano epoxides as new masked &#945;&#8208;halo acyl halide synthons, is reported. Two out of the three steps are catalysed by highly robust, recyclable and easily available quinine&#8208;derived urea.







Abstract
An enantioselective one&#8208;pot catalytic strategy to dihydroquinoxalinones, featuring novel 1&#8208;phenylsulfonyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyano enantioenriched epoxides as masked &#945;&#8208;halo acyl halide synthons, followed by a domino ring&#8208;opening cyclization (DROC), is documented. A popular quinine&#8208;derived urea served as the catalyst in two out of the three steps performed in the same solvent using commercially available aldehydes, (phenylsulfonyl)acetonitrile, cumyl hydroperoxide and 1,2&#8208;phenylendiamines. Medicinally relevant 3&#8208;aryl/alkyl&#8208;substituted heterocycles are isolated in generally good to high overall yield and high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). A rare example of excellent reusability of an organocatalyst at higher scale, subjected to oxidative conditions, is demonstrated. Mechanistically, labile &#945;&#8208;ketosulfone has been detected as the intermediate involved in the DROC process. Theoretical calculations on the key epoxidation step rationalize the observed stereocontrol, highlighting the important role played by the sulfone group.

         <title>Controlling Gene Expression in Mammalian Cells Using Multiplexed Conditional Guide RNAs for Cas12a**
</title>

Conditional processing of Pol&#8201;II&#8208;transcribed Cas12a gRNAs for gene activation using three different activation modalities was achieved: RISC&#8208;based cleavage, an aptazyme, and an RNA strand displacement mechanism. Several switchable guide RNAs along with Cas12a itself can be integrated on a single transcript using a stabilizing triplex motif.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal control of the activity of CRISPR&#8208;associated (Cas) proteins is of considerable interest for basic research and therapeutics. Here, we show that conditional guide RNAs (gRNAs) for Cas12a can be transcribed in mammalian cells by RNA polymerase II, followed by activation via input&#8208;dependent processing of the 3&#8242; tail of the gRNA transcript. We demonstrate processing using an RNA strand displacement mechanism, as well as microRNA&#8208;dependent processing, and cleavage by a guanine&#8208;responsive ribozyme. We further demonstrate that Cas12a along with several independently switchable gRNAs can be compactly integrated on a single transcript using stabilizing RNA triplexes, providing a route towards Cas12a&#8208;based gene regulation constructs with multi&#8208;input switching capabilities. The principle is shown to work in HEK and mouse fibroblast cells using luminescence, fluorescence, and is also demonstrated for the conditional upregulation of an endogenous gene.

         <title>Direct Photoexcitation of Ethynylbenziodoxolones: An Alternative to Photocatalysis for Alkynylation Reactions**
</title>

Aryl ethynylbenziodoxolones (ArEBXs) can be directly activated by visible light irradiation. In the excited state, ArEBXs act as strong oxidants, alleviating the need for a photocatalyst in decarboxylative and deboronative alkynylations, the oxyalkynylation of enamides, and the C&#8722;H alkynylation of THF.







Abstract
Ethynylbenziodoxolones (EBXs) are commonly used as radical traps in photocatalytic alkynylations. Herein, we report that aryl&#8208;substituted EBX reagents can be directly activated by visible light irradiation. They act as both oxidants and radical traps, alleviating the need for a photocatalyst in several reported EBX&#8208;mediated processes, including decarboxylative and deboronative alkynylations, the oxyalkynylation of enamides and the C&#8722;H alkynylation of THF. Furthermore, the method could be applied to the synthesis of alkynylated quaternary centers from tertiary alcohols via stable oxalate salts and from tertiary amines via aryl imines. A photocatalytic process using 4CzIPN as an organic dye was also developed for the deoxyalkynylation of oxalates.

         <title>Genetically Engineered Polypeptide Adhesive Coacervates for Surgical Applications</title>

Non&#8208;swelling protein&#8208;based coacervate adhesives for in&#8197;vivo applications were fabricated by employing electrostatic complexation of supercharged polypeptides (SUPs) and oppositely charged surfactants. The adhesives exhibited superior performance compared to other reported protein&#8208;based adhesives. The outstanding adhesion performance, good biocompatibility, and biodegradability of SUP adhesives facilitate fast wound healing and skin regeneration.







Abstract
Adhesive hydrogels have been developed for wound healing applications. However, their adhesive performance is impaired dramatically due to their high swelling on wet tissues. To tackle this challenge, we fabricated a new type of non&#8208;swelling protein adhesive for underwater and in&#8197;vivo applications. In this soft material, the electrostatic complexation between supercharged polypeptides with oppositely charged surfactants containing 3,4&#8208;dihydroxylphenylalanine or azobenzene moieties plays an important role for the formation of ultra&#8208;strong adhesive coacervates. Remarkably, the adhesion capability is superior to commercial cyanoacrylate when tested in ambient conditions. Moreover, the adhesion is stronger than other reported protein&#8208;based adhesives in underwater environment. The ex vivo and in vivo experiments demonstrate the persistent adhesive performance and outstanding behaviors for wound sealing and healing.

Chromium(III) polypyridyl complexes typically emit in the red or NIR&#8208;I spectral region. We report a chromium(III) complex, which emits at 1067&#8197;nm at 77&#8197;K upon excitation at 450&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The combination of &#960;&#8208;donating amido with &#960;&#8208;accepting pyridine coordination units in a tridentate chelate ligand causes a strong nephelauxetic effect in a homoleptic CrIII complex, which shifts its luminescence to the NIR&#8208;II spectral range. Previously explored CrIII polypyridine complexes typically emit between 727 and 778&#8197;nm (in the red to NIR&#8208;I spectral region), and ligand design strategies have so far concentrated on optimizing the ligand field strength. The present work takes a fundamentally different approach and focusses on increasing metal&#8211;ligand bond covalence to shift the ruby&#8208;like 2E emission of CrIII to 1067&#8197;nm at 77&#8197;K.

A new suite of 2D FOSY experiments focuses onto one coupled nuclear spin system at a time, that is, a post&#8208;translational modification or a structural hotspot in general, with three to five known frequencies. With higher sensitivity and versatility than achievable by traditional experiments, FOSY solves the spectral dispersion problem and obtains only the relevant local NMR signal assignment in a few hours as demonstrated by Vladislav&#8197;Y. Orekhov and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;23540 for two phosphorylation sites in the 441&#8208;residue IDP Tau.

A mixed noble&#8208;gas cation described by Gary&#8197;J. Schrobilgen and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;23678 was synthesized by reaction of KrF2 and [XeF][AsF6] in liquid HF at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C to form [FKrFXeF][AsF6]&#8901;0.5&#8201;KrF2&#8901;2&#8201;HF. The V&#8208;shaped [FKrFXeF]+ cation, depicted as a space station, is in geosynchronous orbit over Hamilton where [FKrFXeF]+ was created and is being carefully monitored. To the east, decay of a sister station's orbit caused the station to warm, break up, and undergo redox decomposition to [F5Xe][AsF6], XeF4, and Kr as it enters Earth's atmosphere; a rescue shuttle speeds away from the disaster zone.

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization of Amino Acids</title>

Amino acids and peptides are vital elements of metabolic and proteomic regulations. Non&#8208;invasive NMR and MRI techniques are highly suited for metabolomics diagnostics, but lack sufficient sensitivity. This Minireview summarizes the considerable advances in signal amplification through parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization of amino acids and peptides.







Abstract
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has become a universal method for biochemical and biomedical studies, including metabolomics, proteomics, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By increasing the signal of selected molecules, the hyperpolarization of nuclear spin has expanded the reach of NMR and MRI even further (e.g. hyperpolarized solid&#8208;state NMR and metabolic imaging in&#8197;vivo). Parahydrogen (pH2) offers a fast and cost&#8208;efficient way to achieve hyperpolarization, and the last decade has seen extensive advances, including the synthesis of new tracers, catalysts, and transfer methods. The portfolio of hyperpolarized molecules now includes amino acids, which are of great interest for many applications. Here, we provide an overview of the current literature and developments in the hyperpolarization of amino acids and peptides.

         <title>Construction of Heptagon&#8208;Containing Molecular Nanocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23508-23532, October 25, 2021. </description>

Heptagon&#8208;containing molecular nanocarbons have attracted increasing interest of late due to their fascinating structural, physical, and optoelectronic properties. This Review examines recent innovations in solution&#8208;phase and surface&#8208;assisted methods for their synthesis that have enabled the unprecedented exploration of these unique molecular architectures, as well as the intriguing properties of the nanocarbons obtained.







Abstract
Molecular nanocarbons containing heptagonal rings have attracted increasing interest due to their dynamic behavior, electronic properties, aromaticity, and solid&#8208;state packing. Heptagon incorporation can not only induce negative curvature within nanocarbon scaffolds, but also confer significantly altered properties through interaction with adjacent non&#8208;hexagonal rings. Despite the disclosure of several beautiful examples in recent years, synthetic strategies toward heptagon&#8208;embedded molecular nanocarbons remain relatively limited due to the intrinsic challenges of heptagon formation and incorporation into polyarene frameworks. In this Review, recent advances in solution&#8208;mediated and surface&#8208;assisted synthesis of heptagon&#8208;containing molecular nanocarbons, as well as the intriguing properties of these frameworks, will be discussed.

         <title>Unraveling Hydrocarbon Pool Boosted Propane Aromatization on Gallium/ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite by Solid&#8208;State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23630-23634, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrocarbon pool process is revealed in propane aromatization over Ga/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. Cyclopentenyl cations are observed and determined as active intermediates in propane conversion by using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The formation of cyclopentenyl cations initiates autocatalysis of propane to aromatics in the induction period. The aromatization process is promoted by hydride transfer between propane and cyclopentenyl cations.







Abstract
Propane aromatization on metal&#8208;modified zeolites provides a promising route to produce valuable chemicals such as benzene, toluene and xylene via non&#8208;petroleum feedstocks. The mechanistic understanding of propane conversion to aromatics is still challenging due to the complexity of the aromatization process. Herein, by using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and GC&#8208;MS, it is shown that cyclopentenyl cations are formed as active intermediates during propane aromatization on Ga/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. Autocatalysis of propane to aromatics is identified in the induction period. The cyclopentenyl cations serve as key hydrocarbon pool species to co&#8208;catalyze propane conversion and promote aromatics formation, revealing a dominant hydrocarbon pool process in propane aromatization.

         <title>Unambiguous Tracking of Protein Phosphorylation by Fast High&#8208;Resolution FOSY NMR**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23540-23544, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new suite of 2D FOSY experiments focuses on one coupled nuclear spin system at a time, that is, a PTM site or a structural hotspot in general, with 3&#8211;5 known frequencies. With higher sensitivity and versatility than achievable by traditional experiments, FOSY solves the spectral dispersion problem and obtains only the relevant local NMR signal assignment in a few hours, as demonstrated for two phosphorylation sites in the 441&#8208;residue IDP Tau.







Abstract
Dysregulation of post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) like phosphorylation is often involved in disease. NMR may elucidate exact loci and time courses of PTMs at atomic resolution and near&#8208;physiological conditions but requires signal assignment to individual atoms. Conventional NMR methods for this base on tedious global signal assignment that may often fail, as for large intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). We present a sensitive, robust alternative to rapidly obtain only the local assignment near affected signals, based on FOcused SpectroscopY (FOSY) experiments using selective polarisation transfer (SPT). We prove its efficiency by identifying two phosphorylation sites of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3&#946;) in human Tau40, an IDP of 441 residues, where the extreme spectral dispersion in FOSY revealed unprimed phosphorylation also of Ser409. FOSY may broadly benefit NMR studies of PTMs and other hotspots in IDPs, including sites involved in molecular interactions.

Hierarchical organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid PDI@Fe&#8208;Sn@N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx is smartly designed and exhibits superb potassium&#8208;storage properties, thanks to its unique properties including abundant contactable active sites, Fe/Sn&#8211;N3 bonds, electronic polarization, and strong coordination interactions, as shown by detailed experiments and theoretical calculations/simulations.







Abstract
Polyperylenediimide (PDI) is always subject to its modest conductivities, limited reversible active sites and inferior stability for potassium storage. To address these issues, herein, we firstly propose an organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid (PDI@Fe&#8208;Sn@N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx), where Fe/Sn single atoms are bound to the N&#8208;doped MXenes (N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx) via the unsaturated Fe/Sn&#8211;N3 bonds, and functionalized with PDI via d&#8211;&#960; hybridization, forming a high conjugated &#948; skeleton. The resulted hybrid cathode endowed with enhanced electronic/ionic conductivities, lowered dissociation barriers of multiple redox centers and a stable cathode electrolyte interphase layer displays a 14&#8208;electron involved high&#8208;rate capacities and long cycle life. Moreover, it shows competitive performance in full cells even under different folding states and low operating temperatures.

A convenient method to obtain geminal bisenolates L2K2Ge[(CO)R]2 (R=2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl (1&#8201;a,b), L=THF for (1&#8201;a) or [18]&#8208;crown&#8208;6 for (1&#8201;b)), a new synthon for the synthesis of organometallic reagents, is reported. Selected examples of electrophiles were used to display the efficiency of 1&#8201;a,b as new building blocks in organometallic chemistry.







Abstract
We have synthesized the first isolable geminal bisenolates L2K2Ge[(CO)R]2 (R=2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl (2&#8201;a,b), L=THF for (2&#8201;a) or [18]&#8208;crown&#8208;6 for (2&#8201;b)), a new synthon for the synthesis of organometallic reagents. The formation of these derivatives was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The UV/Vis spectra of these anions show three distinct bands, which were assigned by DFT calculations. The efficiency of 2&#8201;a,b to serve as new building block in macromolecular chemistry is demonstrated by the reactions with two different types of electrophiles (acid chlorides and alkyl halides). In all cases the salt metathesis reaction gave rise to novel Ge&#8208;based photoinitiators in good yields.

         <title>Indium&#8208;Catalysed Transfer Hydrogenation for the Reductive Cyclisation of 2&#8208;Alkynyl Enones towards Trisubstituted Furans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23661-23666, October 25, 2021. </description>

InBr3 is used as functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant catalyst for the transfer hydrogenation from &#947;&#8208;terpinene as H2 surrogate to initiate the cyclisation of 2&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;substituted enones to trisubstituted furans in good yields. Design of Experiments was used to optimise the reaction conditions with a few experiments to almost quantitative yields and deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments gave valuable mechanistic insights.







Abstract
Indium tribromide catalysed the transfer hydrogenation from dihydroaromatic compounds, such as the commercially available &#947;&#8208;terpinene, to enones, which resulted in the cyclisation to trisubstituted furan derivatives. The reaction was initiated by a Michael addition of a hydride nucleophile to the enone subunit followed by a Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted cyclisation and the formation of a furan&#8211;indium intermediate and a Wheland intermediate derived from the dihydroaromatic starting material. The product was formed by protonation from the Wheland complex and replaced the indium tribromide substituent. In addition, a site&#8208;specific deuterium labelling of the dihydroaromatic HD surrogates resulted in site specific labelling of the products and gave useful insights into the reaction mechanism by H&#8211;D scrambling.

A mesoporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (MHOF)&#8208;confined biocatalytic cascade nanoreactor is constructed. This MHOF cascade nanoreactor has robust and large transport channels, allowing the efficient diffusion of a wide range of biocatalytic substrates and displays the advantages of superior activities, extended scope of substrates, and ultrahigh stability that enables mimicking intracellular signal communications and complex chemical transformations.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first example of using mesoporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MHOFs) as the protecting scaffold to organize a biocatalytic cascade. The confined microenvironment of MHOFs has robust and large transport channels, allowing the efficient transport of a wide range of biocatalytic substrates. This new MHOF&#8208;confined cascade system shows superior activity, extended scope of catalytic substrates, and ultrahigh stability that enables the operation of complex chemical transformations in a porous carrier. In addition, the advantages of MHOF&#8208;confined cascades system for point&#8208;of&#8208;care biosensing are also demonstrated. This study highlights the advantages of HOFs as scaffold for multiple enzyme assemblies, which has huge potential for mimicking complex cellular transformation networks in a controllable manner.

         <title>High&#8208;Fidelity NIR&#8208;II Multiplexed Lifetime Bioimaging with Bright Double Interfaced Lanthanide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23545-23551, October 25, 2021. </description>

We developed a series of Er3+ doped double interface nanoparticles with resembled strong fluorescence intensity and differentiable fluorescence lifetimes for high&#8208;fidelity in vivo lifetime multiplexed imaging.







Abstract
Fluorescence lifetime imaging provides more possibility of in vivo multiplexing in second near infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. However, it still faces the obstacle that fluorescent probes with differentiable lifetime often exhibit quite different fluorescence intensity, especially the short lifetime usually accompanies with a weak fluorescence intensity, resulting in the difficulty for simultaneously decoding multiplexed lifetime information due to the interference of background noise. To facilitate high&#8208;fidelity lifetime multiplexed imaging, we developed a series of Er3+ doped double interface fluorescent nanoprobes (Er&#8208;DINPs): &#945;&#8208;NaYF4@NaErF4: Ce@NaYbF4@NaErF4: Ce@NaYF4 with strong fluorescence intensity and easily distinguishable fluorescence lifetime.

&lt;p&gt;We developed a series of Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; doped double interface nanoparticles with resembled strong fluorescence intensity and differentiable fluorescence lifetimes for high-fidelity in vivo lifetime multiplexed imaging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorescence lifetime imaging provides more possibility of in vivo multiplexing in second near infrared (NIR-II) window. However, it still faces the obstacle that fluorescent probes with differentiable lifetime often exhibit quite different fluorescence intensity, especially the short lifetime usually accompanies with a weak fluorescence intensity, resulting in the difficulty for simultaneously decoding multiplexed lifetime information due to the interference of background noise. To facilitate high-fidelity lifetime multiplexed imaging, we developed a series of Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; doped double interface fluorescent nanoprobes (Er-DINPs): &#945;-NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NaErF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;: Ce@NaYbF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NaErF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;: Ce@NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with strong fluorescence intensity and easily distinguishable fluorescence lifetime. Both in vitro and in vivo experimental results confirmed the advantage of these probes with comparable fluorescence intensity for high-fidelity multiplexed lifetime bioimaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Glucose&#8208;Powered Activatable Nanozyme Breaking pH and H2O2 Limitations for Treating Diabetic Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23534-23539, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we communicate an activatable nanozyme with targeting capability to simultaneously break the local pH and H2O2 limitations under physiological conditions. Instead of synthesizing new nanomaterials, we solved physiological limitations on nanozymes by regulating the local microenvironment. This strategy is generally accessible for nanozymes, and significant for facilitating biological applications of nanozymes.







Abstract
The peroxidase&#8208;like activity of nanozymes is promising for chemodynamic therapy by catalyzing H2O2 into .OH. However, for most nanozymes, this activity is optimal just in acidic solutions, while the pH of most physiological systems is beyond 7.0 (even &gt;8.0 in chronic wounds) with inadequate H2O2. We herein communicate an activatable nanozyme with targeting capability to simultaneously break the local pH and H2O2 limitations under physiological conditions. As a proof of concept, aptamer&#8208;functionalized nanozymes, glucose oxidase, and hyaluronic acid constitute an activatable nanocapsule &#8220;APGH&#8221;, which can be activated by bacteria&#8208;secreted hyaluronidase in infected wounds. Nanozymes bind onto bacteria through aptamer recognition, and glucose oxidation tunes the local pH down and supplements H2O2 for the in&#8208;situ generation of .OH on bacteria surfaces. The activity switching and enhanced antibacterial effect of the nanocapsule were verified in&#8197;vitro and in diabetic wounds. This strategy for directly regulating local microenvironment is generally accessible for nanozymes, and significant for facilitating biological applications of nanozymes.

Based on a chiral donor&#8211;acceptor copolymerization strategy, two pairs of chiral nonconjugated TADF polymers with low &#916;EST values and high PLQYs were constructed. The corresponding solution&#8208;processed CP&#8208;OLEDs exhibited intense CPEL signals and high device efficiencies with an EQEmax of up to 22.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
A strategy of chiral donor&#8211;acceptor copolymerization is proposed to develop chiral nonconjugated polymers with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Based on this strategy, two pairs of chiral polymers (R,R)&#8208;/(S,S)&#8208;pTpAcDPS and (R,R)&#8208;/(S,S)&#8208;pTpAcBP were synthesized. The alternating copolymerization of the chiral donors and acceptors could effectively separate the frontier molecular orbitals, which made the polymers show small &#916;EST of 0.01&#8211;0.03&#8197;eV and efficient TADF properties. Moreover, the polymers also showed the quantum yield of up to 92&#8201;% and the circularly polarized luminescence. The solution&#8208;processed circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes showed circularly polarized electroluminescence signals with high external quantum efficiencies of up to 22.1&#8201;% and maximum luminance of up to 34350&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This is the first report of CP&#8208;OLEDs based on chiral TADF polymer, which provides a useful and valuable guidance for the development of high&#8208;efficiency CPEL polymers.

         <title>Phosphorus Induced Electron Localization of Single Iron Sites for Boosted CO2 Electroreduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23614-23618, October 25, 2021. </description>

Single phosphorus atoms were successfully incorporated into a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon supported single Fe atom catalyst mainly in the form of P&#8722;C bonds, which were demonstrated to promote CO2 electroreduction to CO at low overpotentials. The maximum CO faradaic efficiency was over 97&#8201;% at a low overpotential with a Tafel slope of only 59&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into chemicals and fuels has recently attracted much interest, but normally suffers from a high overpotential and low selectivity. In this work, single P atoms were introduced into a N&#8208;doped carbon supported single Fe atom catalyst (Fe&#8208;SAC/NPC) mainly in the form of P&#8722;C bonds for CO2 electroreduction to CO in an aqueous solution. This catalyst exhibited a CO Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;97&#8201;% at a low overpotential of 320&#8197;mV, and a Tafel slope of only 59&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gold catalysts. Experimental analysis combined with DFT calculations suggested that single P atom in high coordination shells (n&#8805;3), in particular the third coordination shell of Fe center enhanced the electronic localization of Fe, which improved the stabilization of the key *COOH intermediate on Fe, leading to superior CO2 electrochemical reduction performance at low overpotentials.

         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective formal [3+2] cycloaddition of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and vinyl epoxides or vinylethylene carbonates was achieved with a broad substrate scope, low catalyst loading, good yields, and excellent enantioselectivities. The enantioenriched 2,2&#8208;difluorinated tetrahydrofurans were transformed to novel gem&#8208;difluorinated heterocyclic compounds.







Abstract
The asymmetric synthesis of 2,2&#8208;difluorinated tetrahydrofurans was accomplished via enantioselective formal [3+2] cycloaddition catalyzed by palladium. The asymmetric reaction between gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and racemic vinyl epoxides or vinylethylene carbonates resulted in the formation of enantioenriched 2,2&#8208;difluorotetrahydrofurans with an enantioselectivity up to 98&#8201;%. Notably, the reaction used the readily available (R)&#8208;BINAP as the ligand at a low loading and yielded a wide variety of difluorinated products in moderate to high yields. Both chiral diastereomers could be obtained in a single sequence.

         <title>Doxorubicin&#8208;Sensitized Luminescence of NIR&#8208;Emitting Ytterbium Liposomes: Towards Direct Monitoring of Drug Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23574-23577, October 25, 2021. </description>

Doxorubicin&#8208;sensitized near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission of Yb3+ is observable in solutions of liposomes encapsulating the drug and amphiphilic Yb3+ complexes. This emission vanishes when the liposome is destroyed and doxorubicin is released. The NIR Yb3+ luminescence could be observed in living mice with a commercial macroscopic setup.







Abstract
Drug&#8208;loaded liposomes are typical examples of nanomedicines. We show here that doxorubicin, the anti&#8208;cancer agent in the liposomal drug Doxil, can sensitize Ytterbium (Yb3+) and generate its near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission. When doxorubicin and amphiphilic Yb3+ chelates are incorporated into liposomes, the sensitized emission of Yb3+ is dependent on the integrity of the particles, which can be used to monitor drug release. We also established the first demonstration that the NIR Yb3+ emission signal is observable in living mice following intratumoral injection of the Yb3+&#8208;doxorubicin&#8208;liposomes, using a commercial macroscopic setup equipped with a NIR camera.

An asymmetric hydrogenation of 3&#8208;benzoylaminocoumarins was achieved for the first time using a BridgePhos&#8208;Rh catalytic system. Chiral 3&#8208;amino dihydrocoumarins were obtained in high yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99.7&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
An asymmetric hydrogenation of 3&#8208;benzoylaminocoumarins was achieved for the first time using our BridgePhos&#8208;Rh catalytic system, providing chiral 3&#8208;amino dihydrocoumarins in high yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99.7&#8201;% ee). The relationship between the enantioselectivities of the hydrogenations and the dihedral angles and the resulting &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking effects of the BridgePhos&#8208;Rh complexes, which were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, are discussed. The corresponding hydrogenated products allow for many transformations, providing several chiral skeletons with important physiological and pharmacological activities.

         <title>Realizing Record&#8208;High Electroluminescence Efficiency of 31.5&#8201;% for Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecules</title>

Tailor&#8208;made red thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules with intramolecular hydrogen bonding are developed, which exhibit excellent photoluminescence efficiencies and large horizontal dipole ratios, and thus furnish the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art red and near infrared OLEDs, with a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 31.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Tailor&#8208;made red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules comprised of an electron&#8208;withdrawing pyrazino[2,3&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarbonitrile core and various electron&#8208;donating triarylamines are developed. They can form intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding, which is conducive to improving emission efficiency and promoting horizontal orientation and show near infrared (NIR) emissions (692&#8211;710 nm) in neat films and red delayed fluorescence (606&#8211;630 nm) with high photoluminescence quantum yields (73&#8211;90%) in doped films. They prefer horizontal orientation with large horizontal dipole ratios in films, rendering high optical out&#8208;coupling factors (0.39&#8211;0.41). Their non&#8208;doped OLEDs exhibit NIR lights (716&#8211;748 nm) with maximum external quantum efficiencies (&#951;ext,max) of 1.0&#8211;1.9%. And their doped OLEDs radiate red lights (606&#8211;648 nm) and achieve record&#8208;beating &#951;ext,max of up to 31.5%. These new red TADF materials should have great potentials in display and lighting devices.

         <dc:description>
Spectroelectrochemical and computational methods are combined to shed light on the promising reactivity of semiconductor chalcopyrites towards hydrogen production via photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. A direct correlation between the PEC response and the chemical nature of the catalytic interface is presented, providing guidelines for engineering the performance of chalcopyrites.







Abstract
Gathering information on the atomic nature of reactive sites and trap states is key to fine tuning catalysis and suppressing deleterious surface voltage losses in photoelectrochemical technologies. Here, spectroelectrochemical and computational methods were combined to investigate a model photocathode from the promising chalcopyrite family: CuIn0.3Ga0.7S2. We found that voltage losses are linked to traps induced by surface Ga and In vacancies, whereas operando Raman spectroscopy revealed that catalysis occurred at Ga, In, and S sites. This study allows establishing a bridge between the chalcopyrite's performance and its surface's chemistry, where avoiding formation of Ga and In vacancies is crucial for achieving high activity.

         <title>Thermoneutral N&#8722;H Bond Activation of Ammonia by a Geometrically Constrained Phosphine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23625-23629, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A geometrically constrained phosphine bearing an NNS pincer ligand is reported. The steric and electronic parameters were tuned to allow for unprecedented reversible ammonia activation via N&#8722;H bond scission. The phosphine's electronic structure and the associated reaction mechanism of N&#8722;H bond scission are elucidated by derivatization reactions and computational methods.







Abstract
A geometrically constrained phosphine bearing a tridentate NNS pincer ligand is reported. The effect of the geometric constraint on the electronic structure was probed by theoretical calculations and derivatization reactions. Reactions with N&#8722;H bonds result in formation of cooperative addition products. The thermochemistry of these transformations is strongly dependent on the substrate, with ammonia activation being thermoneutral. This represents the first example of a molecular compound that reversibly activates ammonia via N&#8722;H bond scission in solution upon mild heating.

         <title>Harnessing Shape Complementarity for Upgraded Cyclohexane Purification through Adaptive Bottlenecked Pores in an Imidazole&#8208;Containing MOF</title>

The bottlenecked pores in an imidazole&#8208;containing MOF, namely MAF&#8208;stu&#8208;13, can adapt in shape to specifically bind benzene molecules, making it desirable for upgraded purification to yield ultrahigh&#8208;purity (&#8805;99&#8201;%) cyclohexane in the late stage of industrial liquid&#8208;phase production.







Abstract
Shape complementarity is a biological craft for precisely binding substrates at protein&#8211;protein interfaces. An analogy to such a function can be drawn conceptually for crystalline porous solids; yet the manifested entities are rare in reticular chemistry. The bottleneck&#8208;shaped pores carved out of a metal&#8208;organic framework, Zn(MIBA)2 (aka. MAF&#8208;stu&#8208;13), can perfectly accommodate benzene molecules. Remarkably, its framework adapts to the optimal guest binding&#8208;the enhanced host&#8211;guest interactions in the neck in turn minimize the guest&#8208;guest repulsion in the pore to the extent it turns into attraction&#8208;as demonstrated by the combined X&#8208;ray structural and DFT computational studies. This adaptive material can be used for liquid&#8208;phase production of ultrahigh&#8208;purity (&#8805;99&#8201;%) cyclohexane, achieving a balance between uptake capacity and separation selectivity and surpassing the performances of other porous and nonporous crystals reported recently (e.g. product purity 99.4&#8201;% vs. 97.5&#8201;% to date).

         <title>Nano&#8208;analysis Reveals High Fraction of Serotonin Release during Exocytosis from a Gut Epithelium Model Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23552-23556, October 25, 2021. </description>

Gut&#8208;derived serotonin signaling plays key roles in the modulation of normal GI motility and inflammation. Electrochemical methods were used to study the release of serotonin during exocytosis in human carcinoid BON cells, which was found to be predominantly partial, with vesicles releasing a large fraction of serotonin during each exocytosis event. This finding provides new insights into therapeutic targets for treating GI diseases.







Abstract
Electrochemical methods were used to explore the exocytotic nature of serotonin (5&#8208;HT) release in human carcinoid BON cells, an in&#8197;vitro human enterochromaffin cell model, to understand the mechanisms operating the release of gut&#8208;derived 5&#8208;HT in the intestinal mucosal epithelium. We show that the fractional vesicular 5&#8208;HT release in BON cells is 80&#8201;% compared to previous work in pancreatic beta cells (34&#8201;%). The fractional release increased from 80&#8201;% in control BON cells to 87&#8201;% with 5&#8208;HT preincubation and nearly 100&#8201;% with the combination of 5&#8208;HT and the 5&#8208;HT4 autoreceptor agonist, cisapride. Thus, partial release is the primary mechanism of exocytosis in BON cells, resulting in a variable amount of the vesicular content being released. Factors that control secretion of 5&#8208;HT from enterochromaffin cells or BON cells are important as partial release provides a mechanism for development of effective therapeutic strategies to treat gastrointestinal diseases.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Stabilized Organic Cocrystals for Biological Phototherapy</title>

Organic co&#8208;crystals are solid&#8208;state multifunctional materials with intriguing properties whereas the supramolecular interactions within co&#8208;crystals limited their stability in solution and their application in biology. Utilizing metal&#8211;organic framework to stabilize and strengthen the charge&#8208;transfer interaction between electron donor and electron acceptor, a water&#8208;dispersible co&#8208;crystal was obtained and applied in photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Organic self&#8208;assembled co&#8208;crystals have garnered considerable attention due to their facile synthesis and intriguing properties, but supramolecular interactions restrict their stability in aqueous solution, which is especially important for biological applications. Herein, we report on the first biological application of aqueous dispersible self&#8208;assembled organic co&#8208;crystals via the construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) &#8208;stabilized co&#8208;crystals. In particular, we built an electron&#8208;deficient MOF with naphthalene diimide (NDI) as the ligand and biocompatible Ca2+ as the metal nodes. An electron donor molecule, pyrene, was encapsulated to form the host&#8211;guest MOF self&#8208;assembled co&#8208;crystal. We observed that such MOF structure leads to uniquely high&#8208;density ordered arrangement and the close intermolecular distance (3.47&#8197;&#197;) of the charge transfer pairs. Hence, the concomitant superior charge transfer interaction between pyrene/NDI can be attained and the resultant photothermal conversion efficiency of Py@Ca&#8208;NDI in aqueous solution can thus reach up to 41.8&#8201;%, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest value among the reported organic co&#8208;crystal materials; it is also much higher than that of the FDA approved photothermal agent ICG as well as most of the reported MOFs. Based on this realization, as a proof of concept, we demonstrated that such a self&#8208;assembled organic co&#8208;crystal platform can be used in biological applications that are exemplified via highly effective long wavelength light photothermal therapy.

When cis&#8208;N&#8208;phthalimidoaziridine is incorporated into a macromolecular backbone, it undergoes structural transformation into an imine by mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;induced 1,2&#8208;migration of the N&#8208;phthalimido group. The migration occurs under mechanochemical conditions but not thermal conditions. The imine is further hydrolyzed in the presence of water under ambient conditions, resulting in an amine and aldehyde.







Abstract
Force&#8208;selective mechanochemical reactions may be important for applications in polymer mechanochemistry, yet it is difficult to achieve such reactions. This paper reports that cis&#8208;N&#8208;phthalimidoaziridine incorporated into a macromolecular backbone undergoes migration of N&#8208;phthalimido group to afford imine under mechanochemical condition and not thermal one. The imine is further hydrolyzed by water bifurcating into amine and aldehyde. These structural transformations are confirmed by 1H&#8197;NMR and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopic analyses. Computational simulations are conducted for the aziridine mechanophore to propose the mechanism of reaction and define the substrate scope of reaction.

         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Oxyenamides are introduced as novel, highly versatile building blocks for the rapid construction of the 1,3&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;ol scaffold. A Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated reaction of 2&#8208;oxyenamides with acylimine precursors and a terminal nucleophile enables a modular assembly of the 1,3&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;ol structure bearing three continuous stereocenters with excellent levels of diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A highly diastereoselective one&#8208;pot synthesis of the 1,3&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;alcohol unit bearing three continuous stereocenters is described. This method utilizes 2&#8208;oxyenamides as a novel type of building block for the rapid assembly of the 1,3&#8208;diamine scaffold containing an additional stereogenic oxygen functionality at the C2 position. A stereoselective preparation of the required (Z)&#8208;oxyenamides is reported as well.

     alt="Oxyenamides as Versatile Building Blocks for a Highly Stereoselective One-Pot Synthesis of the 1,3-Diamino-2-ol-Scaffold Containing Three Continuous Stereocenters"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2-Oxyenamides are introduced as novel, highly versatile building blocks for the rapid construction of the 1,3-diamino-2-ol scaffold. A Lewis-acid-mediated reaction of 2-oxyenamides with acylimine precursors and a terminal nucleophile enables a modular assembly of the 1,3-diamino-2-ol structure bearing three continuous stereocenters with excellent levels of diastereoselectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly diastereoselective one-pot synthesis of the 1,3-diamino-2-alcohol unit bearing three continuous stereocenters is described. This method utilizes 2-oxyenamides as a novel type of building block for the rapid assembly of the 1,3-diamine scaffold containing an additional stereogenic oxygen functionality at the C2 position. A stereoselective preparation of the required (Z)-oxyenamides is reported as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Decarboxylative Coupling of Aliphatic N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide Esters with Polyfluoroaryl Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23557-23563, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative coupling of aliphatic N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters with polyfluoroaryl zinc reagents was achieved by dual photoredox and copper catalysis. This method allows the installation of alkyl groups on polyfluoroaryls with a wide range of F&#8208;content (2F&#8208;5F) and variable F&#8208;substitution patterns.







Abstract
Polyfluoroarenes are an important class of compounds in medical and material chemistry. The synthesis of alkylated polyfluoroarenes remains challenging. Here we describe a decarboxylative coupling reaction of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids with polyfluoroaryl zinc reagents (Zn&#8208;ArF) via synergetic photoredox and copper catalysis. This method readily converts primary and secondary alkyl carboxylic acids into the corresponding polyfluoroaryl compounds, which could have a wide range of F&#8208;content (2F&#8208;5F) and variable F&#8208;substitution patterns on the aryl groups. Broad scope and good functional group compatibility were achieved, including on substrates derived from natural products and pharmaceuticals. Mechanistic study revealed that a [Cu&#8208;(ArF)2] species could be responsible for the transfer of polyfluoroaryl groups to the alkyl radicals.

         <title>Highly Efficient Spin&#8208;Filtering Transport in Chiral Hybrid Copper Halides</title>

Chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity in Pb(Sn)&#8208;I hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites creates a platform for organic spintronics. Combining the low toxicity of Cu2+ and inoxidizability of halide ions, lead&#8208;free and air&#8208;stable chiral hybrid copper halides (R/S&#8208;MBA)2CuX4 were synthesized by facile methods. These compounds offer efficient (&#8776;90&#8201;%) spin&#8208;filtering charge transport.







Abstract
Chiral Pb(Sn)&#8208;I hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites exhibit outstanding chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) performance, but the nontoxic lead&#8208;free hybrid materials with high stability are still greatly desired for spin filtering in spintronic applications. We synthesize chiral hybrid copper halides (R/S&#8208;MBA)2CuX4 (MBA=methylbenzylammonium; X=Cl, Br) with characteristic 0D CuX4 tetrahedral structural motifs, combining the low toxicity of Cu2+ and air stability of halide ions (Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;). Despite similar structural and electronic features, (R/S&#8208;MBA)2CuBr4 shows much smaller chiroptical activity than the chloride counterpart. Magnetically conductive atomic force microscopy measurements display a typical spin&#8208;polarized charge&#8208;transport property with high efficiency up to 90&#8201;% for both copper halides. Our work expands the CISS effect into eco&#8208;friendly and stable metal&#8211;organic halides, which is promising for applications in spintronics based on transition&#8208;metal hybrid systems.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;[7]helicenocyanine and Its Discrete &#960;&#8208;Stacked Homochiral Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23656-23660, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc phthalocyanine&#8208;[7]helicene hybrid molecular structure forms a discrete homochiral dimer and exhibits chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior also in a racemic mixture. The self&#8208;assembled dimeric structure shows remarkable stability in solution and the solid state, as well as effective electronic communication. The [7]helicene units induce an intense CD effect to the characteristic absorption band in the NIR region of phthalocyanine.







Abstract
In this communication, we demonstrate a novel approach to prepare a discrete dimer of chiral phthalocyanine (Pc) by exploiting the flexible molecular geometry of helicenes, which enables structural interlocking and strong aggregation tendency of Pcs. Synthesized [7]helicene&#8208;Pc hybrid molecular structure, zinc&#8208;[7]helicenocyanine (Zn&#8208;7HPc), exclusively forms a stable dimeric pair consisting of two homochiral molecules. The dimerization constants were estimated to be as high as 8.96&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 3.42&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1 in THF and DMSO, respectively, indicating remarkable stability of dimer. In addition, Zn&#8208;7HPc exhibited chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior, which resulted in preferential formation of a homochiral dimer also in the racemic sample. Two phthalocyanine subunits in the dimeric form strongly communicate with each other as revealed by a large comproportionation constant and observation of an IV&#8208;CT band for the thermodynamically stable mixed&#8208;valence state.

Three types of enantioselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminations have been developed by using nitroarenes, hydroxylamines, or dioxazolones as aminating reagents. This modular process provides efficient access to a wide variety of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;chiral benzylic arylamines, alkylamines, and amides from styrenes in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroarylamination, hydroalkylamination and hydroamidation of styrenes have been developed by NiH catalysis with a simple bioxazoline ligand under mild conditions. A wide range of enantioenriched benzylic arylamines, alkylamines and amides can be easily accessed by nitroarenes, hydroxylamines and dioxazolones, respectively as amination reagents. The chiral induction in these reactions is proposed to proceed through an enantiodifferentiating syn&#8208;hydronickellation step.

         <title>Unlocking the Stereoselectivity and Substrate Acceptance of Enzymes: Proline Induced Loop Engineering Test</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein stability and evolvability influence each other, which has brought an explosion of interest in harnessing protein dynamics to access new functions. Although protein dynamics play essential roles in various catalytically important properties, their high flexibility and diversity makes it difficult to incorporate such properties into rational engineering. Therefore, how to unlock such potential evolvability in a user&#8208;friendly rational design process remains a key challenge. In this endeavor, we describe a method for engineering an enantioselective alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). It enables synthetically important substrate acceptance for 4&#8208;chlorophenyl pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl ketone, as well as perfect stereocontrol of both (  S  )&#8208; and (  R  )&#8208;configured products. Thermodynamic analysis unveiled the subtle interaction between enzyme stability and evolvability, while computational studies provided insights into the origin of selectivity and substrate recognition. Preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of the (  S  )&#8208;product (73% yield; &gt;99%  ee  ) was performed on a gram&#8208;scale. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study demonstrates that interfaced proline residues can be rationally engineered to unlock evolvability and thus provide access to ecologically and economically viable biocatalysts with highly improved catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Monofluoroalkylation: Strategies for the Synthesis of Alkyl Fluorides by C&#8211;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkyl fluorides modulate the conformation, lipophilicity, metabolic stability, and p  K  a  of compounds containing aliphatic motifs and, therefore, have been valuable for medicinal chemistry. Despite significant research in organofluorine chemistry, the synthesis of alkyl fluorides, especially chiral alkyl fluorides, remains a challenge. Most commonly, alkyl fluorides are prepared by the formation of C&#8211;F bonds (fluorination), and numerous strategies for nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical fluorination have been reported in recent years. Although strategies to access alkyl fluorides by C&#8211;C bond formation (monofluoroalkylation) are inherently convergent and complexity&#8208;generating, they have studied less than methods based on fluorination. This Review provides an overview of recent developments in the synthesis of chiral (enantioenriched or racemic) secondary and tertiary alkyl fluorides by monofluoroalkylation catalyzed by transition&#8208;metal complexes. We expect this contribution will illuminate the potential of monofluoroalkylations to simplify the synthesis of complex alkyl fluorides and suggest further research directions in this growing field.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of Cationic Vacancy Defects: A Motif for Surface Restructuration of OER Precatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defects have been found to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of NiFe&#8208;LDH for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nevertheless, their specific configuration and the role played in regulating the surface reconstruction of electrocatalysts remain ambiguous. Herein, cationic vacancy defects are generated from aprotic&#8208;solvent&#8208;solvation&#8208;induced leaking of metal cations from NiFe&#8208;LDH nanosheets. DFT calculation and in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopic observation both reveal that the as&#8208;generated cationic vacancy defects tend to exist as V  M  (M=Ni/Fe); under increasing applied voltage, they tend to assume the configuration V  MOH  , and eventually transform into the vacancy V  MOH&#8208;H  which is the most active yet most difficult to form thermodynamically. Meanwhile, the surface crystalline Ni(OH)  x  species in the NiFe&#8208;LDH is gradually converted into disordered status with increasing voltage; under sufficiently high voltage, when oxygen bubbles start to evolve, local NiOOH species become appearing, which is the residual product from the formation of vacancy V  MOH&#8208;H  . Thus, we demonstrate that the cationic defects evolve along with increasing applied voltage&#160; (V  M  &#187;&#160;V  MOH  &#187; V  MOH&#8208;H  ), and reveal the essential motif for the surface restructuration process of NiFe&#8208;LDH (crystalline Ni(OH)  x  &#187; disordered Ni(OH)  x  &#187; NiOOH). Our work provides insight into defect&#8208;induced surface restructuration behaviors of NiFe&#8208;LDH as a typical precatalyst for efficient OER electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Tertiary Electrophile (Hetero)Benzylation: Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Substitution of Isoprene Monoxide with Arylacetates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective generation of quaternary carbon centers remains challenging but is of growing importance for the preparation of functional molecules. Metal catalyzed allylic alkylations of tertiary electrophiles have provided access to these substructures but remain generally incompatible with organometallic benzyl nucleophiles. Here we demonstrate that electron&#8208;deficient arylacetates can serve as benzyl nucleophile surrogates to generate enantioenriched acyclic molecules containing a quaternary carbon center via a two&#8208;step substitution&#8208;decarboxylation process using isoprene monoxide. Products are often obtained in &gt;90% ee using a commercially available catalyst. An array of electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups on the arylacetate moiety are tolerated. The lactone generated by the initial substitution reaction can be used in further stereoselective transformations to prepare molecules with acyclic vicinal quaternary stereocenters.</dc:description>

         <title>An Exceptional Thermally&#8208;Induced Four&#8208;State Nonlinear&#8208;Optical Switch Arising from Stepwise Molecular Dynamic Changes in a New Hybrid Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The switch materials in channel of nonlinear optics (NLO) are of particular interest in NLO material science. Numerous crystalline NLO switches emerged based on structural phase transition, but most of them reveal single&#8208;step switch between two different second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) states, very rare case involves three or more SHG states. Herein, we report a new organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid salt, (Me  3  NNH  2  )  2  [CdI  4  ], which is an unprecedented instance of reversible three&#8208;step NLO switches between SHG&#8208;silent, &#8208;medium, &#8208;low, and &#8208;high states, with high contrasts of ~25.5/4.3/9.2, respectively, in a temperature range of 213&#8211;303 K. By using the combined techniques of variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural analyses, dielectric constants, solid&#8208;state  13  C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and Hirshfeld surface analyses, we disclosed that this four&#8208;state switchable SHG behavior&#160;is highly associated with the stepwise changed molecular dynamics of the polar organic cations. This finding well demonstrates a complexity of molecular dynamics in simple hybrid salts&#160;and its&#160;potential in&#160;designing new advanced multi&#8208;step switching materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Difluoromethylation of Alkyl Iodides Enabled by Aryl Radical Activation of Carbon&#8211;Iodine Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The engagement of unactivated alkyl halides in copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions has been historically challenging, due to their low reduction potential and the slow oxidative addition of copper(I) catalysts. In this work, we report a novel strategy that leverages the halogen abstraction ability of aryl radicals, thereby engaging a diverse range of alkyl iodides in copper&#8208;catalyzed Negishi&#8211;type cross&#8208;coupling reactions at room temperature. Specifically, aryl radicals generated via copper catalysis efficiently initiate the cleavage of the carbon&#8211;iodide bonds of alkyl iodides. The alkyl radicals thus generated enter the copper catalytic cycles to couple with a difluoromethyl zinc reagent, thus furnishing the alkyl difluoromethane products. This unprecedented Negishi&#8211;type difluoromethylation approach has been applied to the late stage modification of densely functionalized pharmaceutical agents and natural products.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The engagement of unactivated alkyl halides in copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions has been historically challenging, due to their low reduction potential and the slow oxidative addition of copper(I) catalysts. In this work, we report a novel strategy that leverages the halogen abstraction ability of aryl radicals, thereby engaging a diverse range of alkyl iodides in copper-catalyzed Negishi&#8211;type cross-coupling reactions at room temperature. Specifically, aryl radicals generated via copper catalysis efficiently initiate the cleavage of the carbon&#8211;iodide bonds of alkyl iodides. The alkyl radicals thus generated enter the copper catalytic cycles to couple with a difluoromethyl zinc reagent, thus furnishing the alkyl difluoromethane products. This unprecedented Negishi&#8211;type difluoromethylation approach has been applied to the late stage modification of densely functionalized pharmaceutical agents and natural products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vacancy Modulating Co3Sn2S2 Topological Semimetal for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Topological semimetals with high electrical conductivity and suitable carrier density near Fermi level are enticing candidate materials for electrochemical energy storage meriting from their topologically protected surface states. Here we propose the topological semimetal Co  3  Sn  2  S  2  cathode for aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs) showing an obvious discharge plateau approaching 1.5 V. By further introducing a small amount Sn vacancy, an extra pair of redox peaks (1/1.28 V) appears corresponding to the transition of Sn  4+  /Sn  2+  . Sn vacancy leads to more Zn ion built&#8208;in channels and active sites, which promotes charge storage kinetics (Zn  2+  diffusion rate and electron transfer rate) and improves Zn&#8208;ion storage capability. The increase of active sites contributes to the enhancement of capacitance behavior. The Co  3  Sn  1.8  S  2  cathode achieves a specific energy of 394 Wh kg  &#8208;1  (capacity of 343.8 mAh g  &#8208;1  ) at 0.2 A g  &#8208;1  and specific power greater than 4900 W kg  &#8208;1  at 5 A g  &#8208;1  . The battery also retains a capacity of 193.8 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 2970 cycles at 1 A g  &#8208;1  . Benefited from better conductivity at lower temperatures of Co  3  Sn  1.8  S  2  and Zn  x  Co  3  Sn  1.8  S  2  , the prepared quasi&#8208;solid Co  3  Sn  1.8  S  2  //Zn battery delivers superior rate capability even at &#8208;30 &#176;C (126 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.6 A/g) and excellent cycling stability over 3000 cycles retaining 85% of the initial capacity at &#8208;10 &#176;C and 2 A/g. This work provides new insights for designing novel electrode materials by leveraging topologically protected surface states, incorporating vacancies, and in synergy benefit a lot.</dc:description>
