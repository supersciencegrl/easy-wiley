         <title>Bowl&#8208;Assisted Ball Assembly for Solvent&#8208;Processing the C60 Electron Transport Layer of High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pristine fullerene C60 is an excellent electron transport material for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art inverted structure perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but its low solubility leaves thermal evaporation as the only method for depositing it into a high&#8208;quality electron transport layer (ETL). To address this problem, we herein introduce a highly soluble bowl&#8208;shaped additive, corannulene, to assist in C60&#8208;assembly into a smooth and compact film through the favorable bowl&#8208;ball interaction. Our results show that not only corannulene can dramatically enhance the film formability of C60, it also plays a critical role in forming C60&#8208;corannulene (CC) supramolecular species and in boosting intermolecular electron transport dynamics in the ETL. This strategy has allowed CC devices to deliver high power conversion efficiencies up to 21.69%, which is the highest value among the PSCs based on the solution&#8208;processed&#8208;C60 (SP&#8208;C60) ETL. Moreover, the stability of the CC device is far superior to that of the C60&#8208;only device because corannulene can retard and curb the spontaneous aggregation of C60. This work establishes the bowl&#8208;assisted ball assembly strategy for developing low&#8208;cost and efficient SP&#8208;C60 ETLs with high promise for fully&#8208;SP PSCs.</dc:description>

To address this problem, we herein introduce a highly soluble bowl-shaped additive, corannulene, to assist in C60-assembly into a smooth and compact film through the favorable bowl-ball interaction. Our results show that not only corannulene can dramatically enhance the film formability of C60, it also plays a critical role in forming C60-corannulene (CC) supramolecular species and in boosting intermolecular electron transport dynamics in the ETL. This strategy has allowed CC devices to deliver high power conversion efficiencies up to 21.69%, which is the highest value among the PSCs based on the solution-processed-C60 (SP-C60) ETL.

         <title>Polymeric STING Pro&#8208;agonists for Tumor&#8208;Specific Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymeric STING Pro&#8208;agonists for Tumor&#8208;Specific Sonodynamic ImmunotherapyaThe efficacy of combination immunotherapy has been limited by tumor specificity and immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs). Herein, we report the development of polymeric STING pro&#8208;agonists (PSPA), whose sono&#8208;immunotherapeutic efficacy is activated by sono&#8208;irradiation and elevated glutathione (GSH) within tumor microenvironment (TME). PSPA is composed of sonosensitizers (semiconducting polymer) and STING agonists (MSA&#8208;2) via the GSH&#8208;activatable linkers. Under sono&#8208;irradiation, PSPA serves as a sonosensitizer to generate 1O2 and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) of malignant tumor cells. Furthermore, MSA&#8208;2 is released specifically in tumor microenvironment with highly expressed GSH, minimizing the off&#8208;target side effects. The activation of STING pathway elevates the interferon&#8208;&#946; level and synergizes with SDT to enhance anti&#8208;tumor response. Therefore, this work proposes a universal approach for spatiotemporal regulation of cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Mo&#8208;Ni&#8208;based Heterojunction with Fine&#8208;customized d&#8208;Band Centers for Hydrogen Production Coupled with Benzylamine Electrooxidation in Low Alkaline Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzylamine electrooxidation reaction (BAOR) is a promising route to produce value&#8208;added, easy&#8208;separated benzonitrile, and effectively hoist H2 production. However, achieving excellent performance in low alkaline medium is a huge challenge. The performance is intimately correlated with effective coupling of HER and BAOR, which can be achieved by manipulating the d&#8208;electron structure of catalyst to regulate the active species from water. Herein, we constructed a biphasic Mo0.8Ni0.2N&#8208;Ni3N heterojunction for enhanced bifunctional performance toward HER coupled with BAOR by customizing the d&#8208;band centers. Experimental and theoretical calculations indicate that charge transfer in the heterojunction causes the upshift of the d&#8208;band centers, which one side facilitates to decrease water activation energy and optimize H* adsorption on Mo0.8Ni0.2N for promoting HER activity, the other side favors to more easily produce and adsorb OH* from water for forming NiOOH on Ni3N and optimizing adsorption energy of benzylamine, thus catalyzing BAOR effectively. Accordingly, it shows an industrial current density of 220 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.59 V and high Faradaic efficiencies &gt; 99% for H2 production and converting benzylamine to benzonitrile in 0.1 M KOH/0.5 M Na2SO4. This work guides the design of excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts for the scalable production of green hydrogen and value&#8208;added products.</dc:description>

         <title>Design Principles for Maximizing Hole Utilization of Semiconductor Quantum Wires toward Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maximizing hole transfer kinetics &#8212; usually a rate&#8208;determining step in semiconductor&#8208;based artificial photosynthesis &#8212; is pivotal for simultaneously enabling high&#8208;efficiency solar hydrogen production and hole utilization. However, this remains elusive yet as efforts are largely focused on optimizing the electron&#8208;involved half&#8208;reactions only by empirically employing sacrificial electron donors (SEDs) to consume the wasted holes. Here, using high&#8208;quality ZnSe quantum wires as models, we show that how hole transfer processes in different SEDs affect their photocatalytic performances. We found that larger driving forces of SEDs monotonically enhance hole transfer rates and photocatalytic performances by almost three orders of magnitude, a result conforming well with the Auger&#8208;assisted hole transfer model in quantum&#8208;confined systems. Intriguingly, further loading Pt cocatalyts can yield either an Auger&#8208;assisted model or a Marcus inverted region for electron transfer, depending on the competing hole transfer kinetics in SEDs. These findings formulate the design principles for maximizing hole utilization in synergistic solar hydrogen production and photocatalytic oxidations.</dc:description>

         <title>Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction of Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts in Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have been a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis due to their unique intrinsic properties. The synergy between dual atoms provides flexible active sites, promising to enhance performance and even catalyze more complex reactions. However, precisely regulating active site structure and uncovering dual&#8208;atom metal interaction remain grand challenges. In this review, we clarify the significance of the inter&#8208;metal interaction of DACs based on the understanding of active center structures. Three diatomic configurations are elaborated, including isolated dual single&#8208;atom, N/O&#8208;bridged dual&#8208;atom, and direct dual&#8208;metal bonding interaction. Subsequently, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress in heterogeneous oxidation reactions, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions, electrocatalytic reactions, and photocatalytic reactions are summarized. The structure&#8208;activity&#160;relationship between DACs and catalytic performance is then discussed at an atomic level. Finally, the challenges and future directions to engineer the structure of DACs are discussed. This review will offer new prospects for the rational design of efficient DACs toward heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Induced&#8208;Fit&#8208;Identification in a Rigid Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for ppm&#8208;Level CO2 Removal and Ultra&#8208;Pure CO Enrichment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Removing CO2 from crude syngas via physical adsorption is an effective method to yield eligible syngas. However, the bottleneck in trapping ppm&#8208;level CO2 and improving CO purity at higher working temperatures are major challenges. Here we report a thermoresponsive metal&#8208;organic framework (1a&#8208;apz), assembled by rigid Mg2(dobdc) (1a) and aminopyrazine (apz), which not only affords an ultra&#8208;high CO2 capacity (145.0/197.6 cm3 g&#8208;1 (0.01/0.1 bar) at 298 K) but also produces ultra&#8208;pure CO (purity &#8805; 99.99%) at a practical ambient temperature (TA). Several characterization results, including variable&#8208;temperature tests, in&#8208;situ high&#8208;resolution synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (HR&#8208;SXRD), and simulations, explicitly unravel that the excellent property is attributed to the induced&#8208;fit&#8208;identification in 1a&#8208;apz that comprises self&#8208;adaption of apz, multiple binding sites, and complementary electrostatic potential (ESP). Breakthrough tests suggest that 1a&#8208;apz can remove CO2 from 1/99 CO2/CO mixtures at practical 348 K, yielding 70.5 L kg&#8208;1 of CO with ultra&#8208;high purity of &#8805; 99.99%. The excellent separation performance is also revealed by separating crude syngas that contains quinary mixtures of H2/N2/CH4/CO/CO2 (46/18.3/2.4/32.3/1, v/v/v/v/v).</dc:description>

         <title>Directly Imaging and Regulating the Nanoscale Inhomogeneity of S&#8208;Vacancies in Molybdenum Disulfide Monolayer during Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of electron transfer event on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered transition metal dichalcogenides has attracted tremendous attentions attributing to their promising applications in electrochemical devices. Herein, we demonstrate an opto&#8208;electrochemical strategy to directly map and regulate electron transfer event on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayer by combining bright field (BF) imaging technique with electrochemical modulation. The heterogeneity of electrochemical activity on MoS2 monolayer down to nanoscale is resolved spatiotemporally. The thermodynamics of MoS2 monolayer is measured during electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, and the Arrhenius correlations are obtained. We validate that the defect generation engineered by oxygen plasma bombardment dramatically enhances the local electrochemical activity of MoS2 monolayer, which can be attributed to point defects of S&#8208;vacancies as evidenced. Furthermore, by comparing the difference of electron transfer event on MoS2 with various layers, the interlayer coupling effect is uncovered. This study represents a facile method to image the heterogeneity of electrochemical properties for nanomaterials with atomic thickness and regulate the local activity within the plane by extrinsic factors. It also has potential applications in the design and evaluation of high&#8208;performance layered electrochemical systems down to nanoscale.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework&#160;Based Crosslinked Porous Microcapsules for Enzymatic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of porous microcapsules with selective mass transfer and mechanical robustness for enzyme encapsulation is highly desired for biocatalysis, yet the construction remains challenging. Herein, we report the facile fabrication of porous microcapsules by assembling covalent organic framework (COF) spheres at the interfaces of emulsion droplets followed by interparticle crosslinking. The COF microcapsules could offer an enclosed aqueous environment for enzymes, with size&#8208;selective porous shells that allow for the fast diffusion of substrates and products while excluding larger molecules such as protease. Crosslinking of COF spheres not only enhances the structural stability of capsules but also imparts enrichment effects. The enzymes encased in the COF microcapsules show enhanced activity and durability in organic media as verified in both batch reaction and continuous&#8208;flow reaction. The COF microcapsules offer a promising platform for the encapsulation of biomacromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium and Ruthenium Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Sites on Porous Ionic Polymers for Acetylene Dialkoxycarbonylation: Synergetic Effects Stabilize the Active Site and Increase CO Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts usually suffer from the poor stability, limiting its industrial applications. Herein, the dual&#8208;sites Pd1&#8208;Ru1 supported on porous ionic polymers (Pd1&#8208;Ru1/PIPs) was constructed using wetness&#160;impregnation method. The two isolated metal species in the form of binuclear complex was immobilized on the cationic framework of PIPs through ionic bonds. Compared to the single&#8208;Pd or Ru&#8208;site catalyst, it exhibits higher activity with 98% acetylene conversion and near 100% selectivity of dialkoxycarbonylation products as well as better cycling stability for ten times cycles without obvious decay. Based on DFT calculations, it was found that the single&#8208;Ru&#8208;site exhibited a strong CO adsorption energy of &#8208;1.6 eV, leading to an increase in the local CO concentration of the catalyst. Notably, the Pd1&#8208;Ru1/PIPs catalyst had a much lower energy barrier of 2.49 eV compared to 3.87 eV of Pd1/PIPs for the rate&#8208;determining step. The synergetic effect between neighbouring single&#8208;sites Pd1 and Ru1 not only enhanced the overall activity, but also stabilized Pd(II) active sites. The discovery of synergetic effect between single&#8208;sites can deepen our understanding of single&#8208;site catalysts at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Anti&#8208;inflammatory Glycocalyx&#8208;Mimicking Nanoparticles for Colitis Treatment: Construction and In Vivo Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Common medications for treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have limited therapeutic efficacy and severe adverse effects. This underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches that can effectively target inflamed sites in the gastrointestinal tract upon oral administration, exerting potent therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic effects. Here, we report the construction and in vivo therapeutic evaluation of a library of anti&#8208;inflammatory glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (designated GlyNPs) in a mouse model of IBD. The anti&#8208;inflammatory GlyNP library was created by attaching bilirubin (BR) to a library of glycopolymers composed of random combinations of the five most naturally abundant sugars. Direct in vivo screening of 31 BR&#8208;attached anti&#8208;inflammatory GlyNPs via oral administration into mice with acute colitis led to identification of a candidate GlyNP capable of targeting macrophages in the inflamed colon and effectively alleviating colitis symptoms. These findings suggest that the BR&#8208;attached GlyNP library can be used as a platform to identify anti&#8208;inflammatory nanomedicines for various inflammatory diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Optoelectronic Applications of d&#960;&#8208;p&#960; Conjugated Polymers with a Di&#8208;metallaaromatic Acceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of conjugated polymers especially n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors is powered by the design and synthesis of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks. Herein, a strong acceptor building block with di&#8208;metallaaromatic structure was designed and synthesized by connecting two electron&#8208;deficient metallaaromatic units through a &#960;&#8208;conjugated bridge. Then, a double&#8208;monomer polymerization methodology was developed for inserting it into conjugated polymer scaffolds to yield metallopolymers.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of conjugated polymers especially n-type polymer semiconductors is powered by the design and synthesis of electron-deficient building blocks. Herein, a strong acceptor building block with di-metallaaromatic structure was designed and synthesized by connecting two electron-deficient metallaaromatic units through a &#960;-conjugated bridge. Then, a double-monomer polymerization methodology was developed for inserting it into conjugated polymer scaffolds to yield metallopolymers. The isolated well-defined model oligomers indicated polymer structures. Kinetic studies based on NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopies shed light on the polymerization process.

         <title>Molecular Flytraps Held Together by Platinum&#8211;Platinum Intermetallic Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;metal bonds have rarely been sighted in the supramolecular realm, yet they can provide a number of features from which to harvest dynamic behavior and responsiveness. Here, a single Pt&#8722;Pt bond was used to glue two cyclometalated hosts together and generate a flytrap&#8208;like molecule. This compound traps inorganic ions in its jaw, assembles and disassembles photochemically, and irreversibly transports guests from solution to the solid state.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;metal bonds have rarely been explored as active elements in supramolecular assemblies despite their unique potential to introduce responsive behavior. In this report, a dynamic molecular container composed of two cyclometalated Pt units is constructed using Pt&#8722;Pt bonds. This molecule&#8212;the flytrap&#8212;has a flexible jaw composed of two [18]crown&#8208;6 ethers that can adapt their shape to bind large inorganic cations with sub&#8208;micromolar affinity. Along with the spectroscopic and crystallographic characterization of the flytrap, we report its photochemical assembly, which allows the capture of ions and their transport from solution to the solid state. In addition, we have been able to recycle the flytrap to regenerate its starting material due to the reversible nature of the Pt&#8722;Pt bond. We believe that other molecular containers and materials for harvesting valuable substrates from solution could be assembled using the advances presented here.

         <title>Tetrazole Linkages as Photoactivated Fuels for Light&#8208;Regulated Photothermal/Photocatalytic Propulsion of Versatile Polymer Nanoplatforms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivated versatile polymer nanoplatforms with asymmetric geometry enable on&#8208;demand integration of various functionalities via tetrazole linkages. In response to UV or visible light, tetrazoles as light&#8208;triggered fuels simultaneously perform photocatalytic N2 release and photothermal conversion within the polymer nanoplatforms for powering the multimode synergistic propulsion, thus showing potential in bio&#8208;applications.







Abstract
Colloidal motors with multimode propulsion have attracted considerable attention because of enhanced transportability. It is a great challenge to fabricate colloidal motors powered by a single engine for multimode synergistic propulsion. Herein, we report on Janus versatile polymer nanoplatforms integrating various functionalities via tetrazole linkages for light&#8208;regulated multimode synergistic propulsion in the liquid. The presence of tetrazole linkages in the polymers endows the nanoparticles with various photoresponsive capabilities. A sole energy source (ultraviolet or visible light) simultaneously activates photocatalytic N2 release and photothermal conversion within the tetrazole&#8208;containing polymer phase at one side of asymmetric nanoparticles for converting light energy into photothermal/photocatalytic propulsion independent of the surrounding chemical medium. The photoactivated locomotion using tetrazoles as light&#8208;triggered fuels highly corresponds to light wavelengths, light powers and tetrazole contents. The tetrazole linkages capable of incorporating various functionalities to the polymer nanoparticles allow on&#8208;demand customizing of the colloidal motors, showing great potential in bio&#8208;applications.

         <title>Optimizing Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction via Interfacial Electric Field Modulation: Elevating d&#8208;Band Center in WS2&#8208;WO3 for Enhanced Intermediate Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong interfacial electric field in WS2&#8208;WO3 can enhance the adsorption of intermediates by elevating the d&#8208;band center of W, resulting in an accelerated electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) kinetics.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) has emerged as a promising approach to synthesizing green ammonia under ambient conditions. Tungsten (W) is one of the most effective ENRR catalysts. In this reaction, the protonation of intermediates is the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS). Enhancing the adsorption of intermediates is crucial to increase the protonation of intermediates, which can lead to improved catalytic performance. Herein, we constructed a strong interfacial electric field in WS2&#8208;WO3 to elevate the d&#8208;band center of W, thereby strengthening the adsorption of intermediates. Experimental results demonstrated that this approach led to a significantly improved ENRR performance. Specifically, WS2&#8208;WO3 exhibited a high NH3 yield of 62.38&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 and a promoted faraday efficiency (FE) of 24.24&#8201;%. Furthermore, in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations showed that the strong interfacial electric field in WS2&#8208;WO3 upshifted the d&#8208;band center of W towards the Fermi level, leading to enhanced adsorption of &#8722;NH2 and &#8722;NH intermediates on the catalyst surface. This resulted in a significantly promoted reaction rate of the RDS. Overall, our study offers new insights into the relationship between interfacial electric field and d&#8208;band center and provides a promising strategy to enhance the intermediates adsorption during the ENRR process.

         <title>Supramolecularly Engineered Reporters with Superoxide Anion&#8208;Triggered Chemiluminescence for Early Diagnosis and Efficient Amelioration of Acute Kidney Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecularly engineered chemiluminescence reporters (PCCS), consisting of L&#8208;serine&#8208;modified PLGA&#8208;encapsulated peroxyoxalate, chlorin e6 and superoxide dismutase, are reported. The PCCS reporters were applied for the simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of acute kidney injury.







Abstract
We report the &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8221; preparation of kidney injury molecule&#8208;1&#8208;targeting supramolecular chemiluminescence (CL) reporters (PCCS), consisting of L&#8208;serine&#8208;modified poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic) acid (PLGA)&#8208;encapsulated peroxyoxalate (CPPO), chlorin e6 (Ce6) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), for early diagnosis and amelioration of acute kidney injury (AKI). In this system, O2&#8901;&#8722;, a biomarker of AKI, triggers the oxidation of CPPO to 1,2&#8208;dioxetanedione and subsequent CL emission via CL resonance energy transfer to Ce6. The L&#8208;serine&#8208;modified PLGA stabilizes CPPO and Ce6 via noncovalent interactions, promoting long&#8208;lived CL (half&#8208;lives: &#8776;1000&#8197;s). Transcriptomics analysis shows that PCCS reporters reduce the inflammatory response through glutathione metabolism and inhibition of the tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway. The reporters are able to non&#8208;invasively detect AKI at least 12&#8197;h earlier than current assays, and their antioxidant properties allow simultaneous treatment of AKI.

         <title>40 Years of Low&#8208;Temperature Electrolytes for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 40&#8197;years development of low&#8208;temperature electrolytes for rechargeable batteries has been reviewed. Critical insights are given from both underlying mechanistic and practical engineering aspects while we traverse the history on the rational design of low&#8208;temperature electrolyte systems.







Abstract
Rechargeable lithium batteries are one of the most appropriate energy storage systems in our electrified society, as virtually all portable electronic devices and electric vehicles today rely on the chemical energy stored in them. However, sub&#8208;zero Celsius operation, especially below &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, remains a huge challenge for lithium batteries and greatly limits their application in extreme environments.

     alt="40 Years of Low-Temperature Electrolytes for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 40&#8197;years development of low-temperature electrolytes for rechargeable batteries has been reviewed. Critical insights are given from both underlying mechanistic and practical engineering aspects while we traverse the history on the rational design of low-temperature electrolyte systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable lithium batteries are one of the most appropriate energy storage systems in our electrified society, as virtually all portable electronic devices and electric vehicles today rely on the chemical energy stored in them. However, sub-zero Celsius operation, especially below &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, remains a huge challenge for lithium batteries and greatly limits their application in extreme environments. Slow Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion and charge transfer kinetics have been identified as two main origins of the poor performance of RLBs under low-temperature conditions, both strongly associated with the liquid electrolyte that governs bulk and interfacial ion transport. In this review, we first analyze the low-temperature kinetic behavior and failure mechanism of lithium batteries from an electrolyte standpoint. We next trace the history of low-temperature electrolytes in the past 40&#8197;years (1983&#8211;2022), followed by a comprehensive summary of the research progress as well as introducing the state-of-the-art characterization and computational methods for revealing their underlying mechanisms. Finally, we provide some perspectives on future research of low-temperature electrolytes with particular emphasis on mechanism analysis and practical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing Charge&#8208;Transfer Processes in a Covalently Linked [Ge9]&#8208;Cluster Imine Dyad</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silylated [Ge9] clusters form a novel type of chromophore system. Protonation of a covalently cluster&#8208;bound imine moiety results in an intense color change from red to green. Transient absorption spectroscopy and DFT calculations on the protonated form reveal ultrafast dynamics upon photoexcitation leading to a charge&#8208;transfer between the cluster and the imine moiety, thus giving the proof of principle for a cluster&#8208;imine dyad.







Abstract
C60 donor dyads in which the carbon cage is covalently linked to an electron&#8208;donating unit have been discussed as one possibility for an electron&#8208;transfer system, and it has been shown that spherical [Ge9] cluster anions show a close relation to fullerenes with respect to their electronic structure. However, the optical properties of these clusters and of functionalized cluster derivatives are almost unknown. We now report on the synthesis of the intensely red [Ge9] cluster linked to an extended &#960;&#8208;electron system. [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2{CH3C=N}&#8208;DAB(II)Dipp]&#8722; (1&#8722;) is formed upon the reaction of [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2]2&#8722; with bromo&#8208;diazaborole DAB(II)Dipp&#8208;Br in CH3CN (TMS=trimethylsilyl; DAB(II)=1,3,2&#8208;diazaborole with an unsaturated backbone; Dipp=2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylphenyl). Reversible protonation of the imine entity in 1&#8722; yields the deep green, zwitterionic cluster [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2{CH3C=N(H)}&#8208;DAB(II)Dipp] (1&#8208;H) and vice versa. Optical spectroscopy combined with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory suggests a charge&#8208;transfer excitation between the cluster and the antibonding &#960;* orbital of the imine moiety as the cause of the intense coloration. An absorption maximum of 1&#8208;H in the red region of the electromagnetic spectrum and the corresponding lowest&#8208;energy excited state at &#955;=669&#8197;nm make the compound an interesting starting point for further investigations targeting the design of photo&#8208;active cluster compounds.

         <title>Hybrid Improper Ferroelectricity in Columnar (NaY)MnMnTi4O12</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In columnar order quadrupole perovskites A2A&#8242;A&#8242;&#8242;B4O12 hybrid improper ferroelectricity emerges through A&#8208;site cation ordering across anti&#8208;displaced structural columns. This novel form of polar order couples to an intrinsic proper ferroelectric instability associated with underbonded magnetic A&#8242; Mn2+ ions, giving rise to a biased, asymmetric switching response under applied electric field that coexists at low temperature with antiferromagnetism.







Abstract
We show that cation ordering on A site columns, oppositely displaced via coupling to B site octahedral tilts, results in a polar phase of the columnar perovskite (NaY)MnMnTi4O12. This scheme is similar to hybrid improper ferroelectricity found in layered perovskites, and can be considered a realisation of hybrid improper ferroelectricity in columnar perovskites. The cation ordering is controlled by annealing temperature and when present it also polarises the local dipoles associated with pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller active Mn2+ ions to establish an additional ferroelectric order out of an otherwise disordered dipolar glass. Below TN&#8776;12&#8197;K, Mn2+ spins order, making the columnar perovskites rare systems in which ordered electric and magnetic dipoles may reside on the same transition metal sublattice.

         <title>A Radio&#8208;Pharmaceutical Fluorescent Probe for Synergistic Cancer Radiotherapy and Ratiometric Imaging of Tumor Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optical imaging agent and radiosensitized pharmaceutical containing diselenide and metronidazole was developed to realize the radiosensitizing effect and report the ROS levels through ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging. This molecule exhibited synergetic radiosensitization and could monitor the radiotherapy response for both hypoxic tumors and orthotopic glioma.







Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) is an effective and widely applied cancer treatment strategy in clinic. However, it usually suffers from radioresistance of tumor cells and severs side effects of excessive radiation dose. Therefore, it is highly significant to improve radiotherapeutic performance and monitor real&#8208;time tumor response, achieving precise and safe RT. Herein, an X&#8208;ray responsive radio&#8208;pharmaceutical molecule containing chemical radiosensitizers of diselenide and nitroimidazole (BBT&#8208;IR/Se&#8208;MN) is reported. BBT&#8208;IR/Se&#8208;MN exhibits enhanced radiotherapeutic effect via a multifaceted mechanisms and self&#8208;monitoring ROS levels in tumors during RT. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, the diselenide produces high levels of ROS, leading to enhanced DNA damage of cancer cell. Afterwards, the nitroimidazole in the molecule inhibits the damaged DNA repair, offering a synergetic radiosensitization effect of cancer. Moreover, the probe shows low and high NIR&#8208;II fluorescence ratios in the absence and presence of ROS, which is suitable for precise and quantitative monitoring of ROS during sensitized RT. The integrated system is successfully applied for radiosensitization and the early prediction of in vitro and in vivo RT efficacy.

         <title>An n&#8208;Type Conjugated Oligoelectrolyte Mimics Transmembrane Electron Transport Proteins for Enhanced Microbial Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of an n&#8208;type (i.e., redox cycles between reduced and neutral states) redox&#8208;active conjugated oligoelectrolyte, COE&#8208;NDI, has been designed and synthesized. Spontaneous membrane intercalation of COE&#8208;NDI in Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 amplifies inward extracellular electron transfer for more efficient bio&#8208;electroreduction of fumarate to succinate, owing to COE&#8208;NDI&#8217;s function as a transmembrane redox mediator.







Abstract
Interfacing bacteria as biocatalysts with an electrode provides the basis for emerging bioelectrochemical systems that enable sustainable energy interconversion between electrical and chemical energy. Electron transfer rates at the abiotic&#8208;biotic interface are, however, often limited by poor electrical contacts and the intrinsically insulating cell membranes. Herein, we report the first example of an n&#8208;type redox&#8208;active conjugated oligoelectrolyte, namely COE&#8208;NDI, which spontaneously intercalates into cell membranes and mimics the function of endogenous transmembrane electron transport proteins. The incorporation of COE&#8208;NDI into Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 cells amplifies current uptake from the electrode by 4&#8208;fold, resulting in the enhanced bio&#8208;electroreduction of fumarate to succinate. Moreover, COE&#8208;NDI can serve as a &#8220;protein prosthetic&#8221; to rescue current uptake in non&#8208;electrogenic knockout mutants.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Function Analysis of the S&#8208;Glycosylation Reaction in the Biosynthesis of Lincosamide Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The S&#8208;glycosyltransferase LmbT is the only known enzyme that catalyzes the incorporation of ergothioneine, 1, into secondary metabolites. The structure and function analysis of LmbT provided a structural basis for the SN2&#8208;like S&#8208;glycosylation reaction with ergothioneine. These findings will lead to the mechanistic understanding of key enzyme reactions in the biosynthesis of ergothioneine&#8208;containing natural products such as lincomycin&#8197;A.







Abstract
The S&#8208;glycosyltransferase LmbT, involved in the biosynthesis of lincomycin&#8197;A, is the only known enzyme that catalyzes the enzymatic incorporation of rare amino acid L&#8208;ergothioneine (EGT) into secondary metabolites. Here, we show the structure and function analyses of LmbT. Our in vitro analysis of LmbT revealed that the enzyme shows promiscuous substrate specificity toward nitrogenous base moieties in the generation of unnatural nucleotide diphosphate (NDP)&#8208;D&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;lincosamides. Furthermore, the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of LmbT in its apo form and in complex with substrates indicated that the large conformational changes of the active site occur upon binding of the substrates, and that EGT is strictly recognized by salt&#8208;bridge and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions with Arg260 and Trp101, respectively. The structure of LmbT in complex with its substrates, the docking model with the EGT&#8208;S&#8208;conjugated lincosamide, and the structure&#8208;based site&#8208;directed mutagenesis analysis revealed the structural details of the LmbT&#8208;catalyzed SN2&#8208;like S&#8208;glycosylation reaction with EGT.

         <title>Stabilizing Liquids Using Interfacial Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilizing liquids based on supramolecular assembly (non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions) has attracted significant interest, due to the increasing demand for soft, liquid&#8208;based devices. Recent advances in structuring liquids based on non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions are highlighted and a perspective is provided on future directions to inspire further studies on structured liquids based on supramolecular assembly.







Abstract
Stabilizing liquids based on supramolecular assembly (non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions) has attracted significant interest, due to the increasing demand for soft, liquid&#8208;based devices where the shape of the liquid is far from the equilibrium spherical shape. The components comprising these interfacial assemblies must have sufficient binding energies to the interface to prevent their ejection from the interface when the assemblies are compressed. Here, we highlight recent advances in structuring liquids based on non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions. We describe some of the progress made that reveals structure&#8211;property relationships. In addition to treating advances, we discuss some of the limitations and provide a perspective on future directions to inspire further studies on structured liquids based on supramolecular assembly.

         <title>Chemical Modification of a Bacterial Siderophore by a Competitor in Dual&#8208;Species Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed investigation of the inter&#8208;species chemical communication between the human pathogens P. aeruginosa and S. aureus revealed that S. aureus converts pyochelin, an important siderophore secreted by P. aeruginosa, to its less potent pyochelin methyl ester (PME). In addition, PME is sensed by P. aeruginosa and affects metabolite expression, indicating a potential role as signaling molecule for both species.







Abstract
Chemical communication between competing bacteria in multi&#8208;species environments often enables both species to adapt and survive, and perhaps even thrive. P. aeruginosa and S. aureus are two bacterial pathogens found in natural biofilms, especially in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, where recent studies showed that there is often cooperation between the two species, leading to increased disease severity and antibiotic resistance. However, the mechanisms behind this cooperation are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed co&#8208;cultured biofilms in various settings, and we applied untargeted mass spectrometry&#8208;based metabolomics analyses, combined with synthetic validation of candidate compounds. We unexpectedly discovered that S. aureus can convert pyochelin into pyochelin methyl ester, an analogue of pyochelin with reduced affinity for iron (III). This conversion allows S. aureus to coexist more readily with P. aeruginosa and unveils a mechanism underlying the formation of robust dual&#8208;species biofilms.

         <title>Orderly Self&#8208;Assembly of Organic Fluorophores for Sensing and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In past decades, the orderly self&#8208;assembly of functionalized fluorophores has gained much attention. Such fluorophores can form nanoaggregates by self&#8208;assembly, which prolong their residence time in vivo, achieving high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios and accurate bioimaging. In this review, we summarize progress and challenges of self&#8208;assembled fluorophores, focusing on their development history, self&#8208;assembly mechanism and biomedical applications.







Abstract
Fluorescence imaging utilizing traditional organic fluorophores is extensively applied in both cellular and in vivo studies. However, it faces significant obstacles, such as low signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) and spurious positive/negative signals, primarily due to the facile diffusion of these fluorophores. To cope with this challenge, orderly self&#8208;assembled functionalized organic fluorophores have gained significant attention in the past decades. These fluorophores can create nanoaggregates via a well&#8208;ordered self&#8208;assembly process, thus prolonging their residency time within cells and in vivo settings. The development of self&#8208;assembled&#8208;based fluorophores is an emerging field, and as such, in this review, we present a summary of the progress and challenges of self&#8208;assembly fluorophores, focusing on their development history, self&#8208;assembly mechanisms, and biomedical applications. We hope that the insights provided herein will assist scientists in further developing functionalized organic fluorophores for in situ imaging, sensing, and therapy.

         <title>Sandwich&#8208;Kernelled AgCu Nanoclusters with Golden Ratio Geometry and Promising Photothermal Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silver copper nanocluster with a golden ratio pentangle structure is prepared. It shows promising photothermal conversion. It is a novel alloy nanocluster with a sandwich&#8208;like kernel (diameter&#8776;0.9&#8197;nm and length&#8776;0.25&#8197;nm), and gives insight into the relationship between structure and photothermal properties.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters have recently attracted extensive interest from the scientific community. However, unlike carbon&#8208;based materials and metal nanocrystals, they rarely exhibit a sheet kernel structure, probably owing to the instability caused by the high exposure of metal atoms (particularly in the relatively less noble Ag or Cu nanoclusters) in such a structure. Herein, we synthesized a novel AgCu nanocluster with a sandwich&#8208;like kernel (diameter&#8776;0.9&#8197;nm and length&#8776;0.25&#8197;nm) by introducing the furfuryl mercaptan ligand (FUR) and the alloying strategy. Interestingly, the kernel consists of a centered silver atom and two planar Ag10 pentacle units with completely mirrored symmetry after a rotation of 36 degrees. The two Ag10 pentacles and some extended structures show an unreported golden ratio geometry, and the two inner five&#8208;membered rings and the centered Ag atom form an unanticipated full&#8208;metal ferrocene&#8208;like structure. The featured kernel structure causes the dominant radial direction transition of excitation electrons, as determined via time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations, which affords the protruding absorption at 612&#8197;nm and contributes to the promising photothermal conversion efficiency of 67.6&#8201;% of the as&#8208;obtained nanocluster, having important implications for structure&#8208;property correlation and the development of nanocluser&#8208;based photothermal materials.

         <title>Expedient Access to Enantioenriched 1&#8208;Azaspiro Cyclobutanones Enabled by Modified Heyns Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Leveraging the unexplored regions of chemical space, the integration of spirocyclic cyclobutane in a molecular scaffold opens up a new vista in modern drug discovery. Despite recent advancements in achieving such motifs, the strategies for their asymmetric construction have not been well&#8208;recognized and remain a formidable challenge. Herein, for the first time, we have demonstrated a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of 1&#8208;azaspiro cyclobutanone enabled by an unusual reactivity of enamine that explore the potentiality of Heyns rearrangement upon electrophilic modification. This design strategy offers viable access to a wide range of cyclobutanone containing spiroindoline and spiropyrrolidine derivatives in good yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee, &gt;20: 1 dr). Furthermore, the practicality of this methodology has been manifested by a scale&#8208;up synthesis of spirocyclic products and their facile post&#8208;synthetic modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating Gas Escape in Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis by Gas Diffusion Layers with Hierarchical Grid Gradients</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At high current densities, gas bubble escape is the critical factor affecting the mass transport and performance of the electrolyzer. For tight assembly water electrolysis technologies, the gas diffusion layer (GDL) between the catalyst layer (CL) and the flow field plate plays a critical role in gas bubble removal. Herein, we demonstrate that the electrolyzer&#8217;s mass transport and performance can be significantly improved by simply manipulating the structure of the GDL. Combined with 3D printing technology, ordered nickel GDLs with straight&#8208;through pores and adjustable grid&#160;sizes are systematically studied. Using an in&#8208;situ high&#8208;speed camera, the gas bubble releasing size and resident time have been observed and analyzed upon the change of the GDL architecture. The results show that a suitable grid size of the GDL can significantly accelerate mass transport by reducing the gas bubble size and the bubble resident time. An adhesive force measurement has further revealed the underlying mechanism. We then proposed and fabricated a novel hierarchical GDL, reaching a current density of 2 A/cm2 at a cell voltage of 1.95 V and 80 oC, one of the highest single&#8208;cell performances in pure&#8208;water&#8208;fed AEMWE.</dc:description>

         <title>Building Blocks and COFs Formed in Concert&#8212;Three&#8208;Component Synthesis of Pyrene&#8208;Fused Azaacene Covalent Organic Framework in the Bulk and as Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant limitations exist in the synthesis of highly ordered structures including the solubility, shape, and packing of building blocks. A three&#8208;component synthesis allows for the preparation of novel pyrene&#8208;fused azaacene covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in a one&#8208;step reaction. The COFs can also be prepared as films, and the optical properties of the materials are studied.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component synthesis methodology is described for the formation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) containing extended aromatics. Notably, this approach enables synthesis of the building blocks and COF along parallel reaction landscapes, on a similar timeframe. The use of fragmental building block components, namely pyrene dione diboronic acid as aggregation&#8208;inducing COF precursor and the diamines o&#8208;phenylenediamine (Ph), 2,3&#8208;diaminonaphthalene (Naph), or (1R,2R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;1,2&#8208;diphenylethylenediamine (2Ph) as extending functionalization units in conjunction with 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene, resulted in the formation of the corresponding pyrene&#8208;fused azaacene, i.e., Aza&#8208;COF series with full conversion of the dione moiety, long&#8208;range order, and high surface area. In addition, the novel three&#8208;component synthesis was successfully applied to produce highly crystalline, oriented thin films of the Aza&#8208;COFs with nanostructured surfaces on various substrates. The Aza&#8208;COFs exhibit light absorption maxima in the blue spectral region, and each Aza&#8208;COF presents a distinct photoluminescence profile. Transient absorption measurements of Aza&#8208;Ph&#8208; and Aza&#8208;Naph&#8208;COFs suggest ultrafast relaxation dynamics of excited&#8208;states within these COFs.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Dependent Reprogramming of Macrophages by Chiral Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is known that extracellular free radical  reactive oxygen species (ROS) rather than intracellular ROS plays a non&#8208;substitutable role in regulation of tumor&#8208;suppressing (M1) tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization. However, most therapeutic nanoplatforms mainly provide intracellular ROS and exhibit insufficient accumulation near TAMs, which strongly limits the macrophage&#8208;based immunotherapeutic effects. Here we design and synthesize chiral MoS2/CoS2 nanozymes with peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like and catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activities to efficiently modulate TAMs polarization and reverse tumor immunosuppression by harnessing their chirality&#8208;specific interactions with biological systems. MoS2/CoS2 nanoparticles coordinated with d&#8208;chirality (d &#8208;NPs, right&#8208;handed) show improved pharmacokinetics with longer circulating half&#8208;life and higher tumor accumulation compared with their l (left&#8208;handed)&#8208; and dl (racemate)&#8208;counterparts. Further, d&#8208;NPs can escape from macrophage uptake in the tumor microenvironment (TME) with the aid of cell&#8208;unpreferred opposite chirality and act as extracellular hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) and oxygen (O2) generators to efficiently repolarize TAMs into M1 phenotype. On the contrary, l&#8208;NPs showed high cellular uptake due to chirality&#8208;driven homologous adhesion between l&#8208;NPs and macrophage membrane, leading to limited M1 polarization performance. As the first example for developing chiral nanozymes as extracellular&#8208;localized ROS generators to reprogram TAMs for cancer immunotherapy, this study opens an avenue for applications of chiral nanozymes in immunomodulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Group 14 Element Hetero&#8208;Difunctionalizations via Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The difunctionalization of unsaturated bonds plays a vital role in the enrichment of molecular complexity. While various catalytic methods for alkene and alkyne difunctionalization have been developed in recent years, hetero&#8208;functionalization the introduction of two different atoms has been less explored. This is mainly due to the challenges associated with achieving high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity, especially when adding two similar atoms from the same group across unsaturated bonds. In this study, we describe a nickel&#8208;catalyzed, three&#8208;component reductive protocol for group 14 element hetero&#8208;difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;enynes using electrochemistry. This new method is mild, selective, and general, allowing for the silyl&#8208;, germanyl&#8208;, and stannyl&#8208;alkylation of enynes. Various chlorosilanes as well as chlorogermans, and chlorostannanes can be successfully used in combination with aryl/alkyl&#8208;substituted 1, 3&#8208;enynes and primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl bromides in the electroreductive coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Post&#8208;synthetic Modifications of Helical &#946;&#8208;Peptide Foldamers Derived from a Thioether&#8208;Containing Cyclic &#946;&#8208;Amino Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a novel cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino acid, trans&#8208;(3S,4R)&#8208;4&#8208;aminotetrahydrothiophene&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid (ATTC), as a versatile building block for designing peptide foldamers with controlled secondary structures. We synthesized and characterized a series of &#946;&#8208;peptide hexamers containing ATTC using various techniques, including X&#8208;ray crystallography, circular dichroism, and NMR spectroscopy. Our findings reveal that ATTC&#8208;containing foldamers can adopt 12&#8208;helical conformations similar to their isosteres and offer the possibility of fine&#8208;tuning their properties via post&#8208;synthetic modifications. In particular, chemoselective conjugation strategies demonstrate that ATTC provides unique post&#8208;synthetic modification opportunities, which expand their potential applications across diverse research areas. Collectively, our study highlights the versatility and utility of ATTC as an alternative to previously reported cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino acid building blocks in both structural and functional aspects, paving the way for future research in the realm of peptide foldamers and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Alkenes: Hypervalent Iodine Meets High&#8208;Valent Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first trifluoromethylation of vinylbenziodoxolones (VBX) is reported herein. The synthetic method is based bench&#8208;stable, high&#8208;valent copper(III) species and can be initiated under thermal conditions and/or irradiation (365&#160;nm) giving access to trifluoromethylated alkenes stereoselectively. Various VBX reagents derived from tyrosine, cysteine, small peptides, thiols and amides can be used as precursors. The obtained alkenes could be further functionalized by reduction or epoxidation of the trifluoromethylated double bond. Furthermore, the method could be applied in a large&#8208;scale batch/flow synthesis and could be performed under visible light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Hypervalent Iodine Reagent Chimeras: Enabling Peptide Functionalization and Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a novel strategy for the modification of peptides based on the introduction of highly reactive hypervalent iodine reagents &#8208; ethynylbenziodoxolones (EBXs)&#8208; onto peptides. These peptide&#8208;EBXs can be easily accessed, both via solution and solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). They can be used to couple the peptide to other peptides or a protein via reaction with Cys, leading to thioalkynes in organic solvents and hypervalent iodine adducts in water buffer. In addition, a photocatalytic decarboxylative coupling to the C&#8208;terminus of peptides was developed using an organic dye. This later reaction was also successful in an intramolecular way, leading to macrocyclic peptides with unprecedented crosslinking. The rigid linear aryl alkyne linker was essential to achieve high affinity to Keap1 at the Nrf2 binding site with potential protein&#8208;protein interaction inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Cooperative CO2 Adsorption via a Cation Crowding Mechanism on a Cesium&#8208;Exchanged Phillipsite Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An understanding of the CO2 adsorption mechanisms on small&#8208;pore zeolites is of practical importance in the development of more efficient adsorbents for the separation of CO2 from N2 or CH4. Here we report that the CO2 isotherms&#160;at 25 &#8208; 75 &#176;C on cesium&#8208;exchanged phillipsite zeolite with a Si/Al ratio of 2.5 (Cs&#8208;PHI&#8208;2.5) are characterized by a rectilinear step shape: limited uptake at low CO2 pressure (PCO2) is followed by highly cooperative uptake at a critical pressure, above which adsorption rapidly approaches capacity (2.0 mmol g&#8208;1). Structural analysis reveal that this isotherm behavior is attributed to the high concentration and large size of Cs+ ions in dehydrated Cs&#8208;PHI&#8208;2.5. This results in Cs+ cation crowding and subsequent dispersal at a critical loading of CO2, which allows the PHI framework to relax to its wide pore form and enables its pores to fill with CO2 over a very narrow range of PCO2. Such a highly cooperative phenomenon has not been observed for other zeolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Instantaneous Free Radical Scavenging by CeO2 Nanoparticles Adjacent to the Fe&#8211;N4 Active Sites for Durable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To achieve the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials with both high activity and durability in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, the attack of free radicals on Fe&#8211;N4 sites must be overcome. Herein, we report a strategy to effectively eliminate radicals at the source to mitigate the degradation by anchoring CeO2 nanoparticles as radicals scavengers adjacent (Scaad&#8208;CeO2) to the Fe&#8211;N4 sites. Radicals such as &#183;OH and HO2&#183; that form at Fe&#8211;N4 sites can be instantaneously eliminated by adjacent CeO2, which shortens the survival time of radicals and the regional space of their damage. As a result, the CeO2 scavengers in Fe&#8211;NC/Scaad&#8208;CeO2 achieved ~80% elimination of the radicals generated at the Fe&#8211;N4 sites. A fuel cell prepared with the Fe&#8211;NC/Scaad&#8208;CeO2 showed a smaller peak power density decay after 30,000 cycles determined with US DOE PGM&#8208;relevant AST, increasing the decay of Fe&#8211;NCPhen from 69% to 28% decay.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cellular proteins are dynamically regulated in response to environmental stimuli. Conventional proteomics compares the entire proteome in different cellular states to identify differentially expressed proteins, which suffers from limited sensitivity for analyzing acute and subtle changes. To address this challenge, nascent proteomics has been developed, which selectively analyze the newly synthesized proteins, thus offering a more sensitive and timely insight into the dynamic changes of the proteome. In this Minireview, we discuss recent advancements in nascent proteomics, with an emphasis on methodological developments.

         <title>Combining Carbazole Building Blocks and &#957;&#8208;DABNA Heteroatom Alignment for a Double Boron&#8208;Embedded MR&#8208;TADF Emitter with Improved Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Building blocks and heteroatom alignments are two determining factors in designing multiple resonance (MR)&#8208;type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. Carbazole&#8208;fused MR emitters, represented by CzBN derivatives, and the heteroatom alignments of &#957;&#8208;DABNA are two star series of MR&#8208;TADF emitters that show impressive performances from the aspects of building blocks and heteroatom alignments, respectively. Herein, a novel CzBN analog, &#928;&#8208;CzBN, featuring &#957;&#8208;DABNA heteroatom alignment is developed via facile one&#8208;shot lithium&#8208;free borylation. &#928;&#8208;CzBN exhibits superior photophysical properties with a photoluminescence quantum yield close to 100% and narrowband sky blue emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 16 nm/85 meV. It also gives efficient TADF properties with a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy offset of 40 meV and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate of 2.9&#215;105 s&#8208;1. The optimized OLED using &#928;&#8208;CzBN as the emitter achieves an exceptional external quantum efficiency of 39.3% with a low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 20% at 1000 cd m&#8208;2 and a narrowband emission at 495 nm with FWHM of 21 nm/106 meV, making it one of the best reported devices based on MR emitters with comprehensive performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Formal [2&#960;+2&#963;] Cycloaddition of Aldehydes with Bicyclobutanes: Expedient Access to Polysubstituted 2&#8208;Oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has attracted tremendous attention because they are playing an important role as saturated bioisosteres of benzenoids in modern drug discovery. Here, we report a BF3&#8208;catalyzed [2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition of aldehydes with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) to access polysubstituted 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes. A new kind of BCB containing an acyl pyrazole group was invented, which not only significantly facilitates the reactions, but can also serve as a handle for diverse downstream transformations. Furthermore, aryl and vinyl epoxides can also be utilized as substrates which undergo cycloaddition with BCBs after in situ rearrangement to aldehydes. We anticipate that our results will promote access to challenging sp3&#8208;rich bicyclic frameworks and the exploration of BCB&#8208;based cycloaddition chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Elusive Double Perovskite Iodides: Structural, Optical, and Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide double perovskites [A2MIMIIIX6] are an important class of materials that have garnered substantial interest as non&#8208;toxic alternatives to conventional lead iodide perovskites for optoelectronic applications. While numerous studies have examined chloride and bromide double perovskites, reports of iodide double perovskites are rare, and their definitive structural characterization has not been reported. Predictive models have aided us here in the synthesis and characterization of five iodide double perovskites of general formula Cs2NaLnI6 (Ln = Ce, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy). The complete crystal structure, structural phase transitions, optical, photoluminescent, and magnetic properties of these compounds are reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Asymmetric Hydrogenation of C=O Bonds of Exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Pentanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly chemoselective earth&#8208;abundant transition metal copper catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of C=O bonds of exocyclic &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated pentanones was realized using H2. The desired products were obtained with up to 99% yield and 96% ee (enantiomeric excess) (99% ee, after recrystallization). The corresponding chiral exocyclic allylic pentanol products can be converted into several bioactive molecules. The hydrogenation mechanism was investigated via deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments and control experiments, which indicate that the keto&#8211;enol isomerization rate of the substrate is faster than that of the hydrogenation and also show that the Cu&#8208;H complex can only catalyze chemoselectively the asymmetric reduction of the carbonyl group. Computational results indicate that the multiple attractive dispersion interactions (MADI effect) between the catalyst with bulky substituents and substrate play important roles which stabilize the transition states and reduce the generation of by&#8208;products.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Soft Porosity and Electrical Properties of Conductive&#8208;on&#8208;Insulating Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the integration of soft porosity and electrical properties, conductive&#8208;on&#8208;insulating metal&#8211;organic framework (cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF) heterostructured nanocrystals (with the semiconductive soft porous interfaces) show enhanced selective sorption toward CO2, electrical gating, and &#8220;shape memory&#8221; effects for the guest responsive iMOF core, as revealed by operando synchrotron measurements.







Abstract
A one&#8208;stone, two&#8208;bird method to integrate the soft porosity and electrical properties of distinct metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) into a single material involves the design of conductive&#8208;on&#8208;insulating MOF (cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF) heterostructures that allow for direct electrical control. Herein, we report the synthesis of cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF heterostructures using a seeded layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer method, in which the sorptive iMOF core is combined with chemiresistive cMOF shells. The resulting cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF heterostructures exhibit enhanced selective sorption of CO2 compared to the pristine iMOF (298&#8197;K, 1&#8197;bar, S
 from 15.4 of ZIF&#8208;7 to 43.2&#8211;152.8). This enhancement is attributed to the porous interface formed by the hybridization of both frameworks at the molecular level. Furthermore, owing to the flexible structure of the iMOF core, the cMOF&#8208;on&#8208;iMOF heterostructures with semiconductive soft porous interfaces demonstrated high flexibility in sensing and electrical &#8220;shape memory&#8221; toward acetone and CO2. This behavior was observed through the guest&#8208;induced structural changes of the iMOF core, as revealed by the operando synchrotron grazing incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements.

         <title>Customizable Supraparticles Constructed from Catechol&#8208;Terminated Molecular Building Blocks with Controllable Intermolecular Interactions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By systematically introducing multiple assembly strategies into the construction of customizable supraparticles based on catechol&#8208;terminated molecular building blocks, conventional supraparticles were endowed with structural and functional customization. This strategy paves a way for building multiscale super&#8208;assembled materials with high degrees of structural complexity and functional diversity.







Abstract
Colloidal supraparticles integrated with multicomponent primary particles come with emerging or synergetic functionalities. However, achieving the functional customization of supraparticles remains a great challenge because of the limited options of building blocks with tailorability and functional extensibility. Herein, we developed a universal approach to construct customizable supraparticles with desired properties from molecular building blocks obtained by the covalent conjugation of catechol groups with a series of orthogonal functional groups. These catechol&#8208;terminated molecular building blocks can assemble into primary particles driven by various intermolecular interactions (i.e. metal&#8208;organic coordination, host&#8211;guest, and hydrophobic interactions), and then further assemble into supraparticles governed by catechol&#8208;mediated interfacial interactions. Our strategy enables the formation of supraparticles with diverse functionalities, such as dual&#8208;pH responsiveness, light&#8208;controllable permeability, and non&#8208;invasive fluorescence labeling of living cells. The ease with which these supraparticles can be fabricated, and the ability to tailor their chemical and physical properties through the choice of metals and orthogonal functional groups used, should enable a variety of applications.

         <title>Controlled Genetic Encoding of Unnatural Amino Acids in a Protein Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the application of the genetic code expansion technique to achieve the site&#8208;specific modification of the sensing region of a nanopore. The rationally designed conformation of unnatural amino acid (UAA) residues provides a favorable geometric orientation for the interactions of peptides and pore. The chemical environment of the sensing region facilitates the direct discrimination of the mixtures of peptides containing hydrophobic amino acids.







Abstract
Conventional protein engineering methods for modifying protein nanopores are typically limited to 20 natural amino acids, which restrict the diversity of the nanopores in structure and function. To enrich the chemical environment inside the nanopore, we employed the genetic code expansion (GCE) technique to site&#8208;specifically incorporate the unnatural amino acid (UAA) into the sensing region of aerolysin nanopores. This approach leveraged the efficient pyrrolysine&#8208;based aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase&#8208;tRNA pair for a high yield of pore&#8208;forming protein. Both molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and single&#8208;molecule sensing experiments demonstrated that the conformation of UAA residues provided a favorable geometric orientation for the interactions of target molecules and the pore. This rationally designed chemical environment enabled the direct discrimination of multiple peptides containing hydrophobic amino acids. Our work provides a new framework for endowing nanopores with unique sensing properties that are difficult to achieve using classical protein engineering approaches.

&lt;p&gt;We present the application of the genetic code expansion technique to achieve the site-specific modification of the sensing region of a nanopore. The rationally designed conformation of unnatural amino acid (UAA) residues provides a favorable geometric orientation for the interactions of peptides and pore. The chemical environment of the sensing region facilitates the direct discrimination of the mixtures of peptides containing hydrophobic amino acids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional protein engineering methods for modifying protein nanopores are typically limited to 20 natural amino acids, which restrict the diversity of the nanopores in structure and function. To enrich the chemical environment inside the nanopore, we employed the genetic code expansion (GCE) technique to site-specifically incorporate the unnatural amino acid (UAA) into the sensing region of aerolysin nanopores. This approach leveraged the efficient pyrrolysine-based aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNA pair for a high yield of pore-forming protein. Both molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and single-molecule sensing experiments demonstrated that the conformation of UAA residues provided a favorable geometric orientation for the interactions of target molecules and the pore. This rationally designed chemical environment enabled the direct discrimination of multiple peptides containing hydrophobic amino acids. Our work provides a new framework for endowing nanopores with unique sensing properties that are difficult to achieve using classical protein engineering approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Monosubstituted Sulfondiimines by Metal&#8208;free Iminations of Sulfilimium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an operationally simple and safe method for the synthesis of N&#8208;monosubstituted sulfondiimines starting from stable sulfiliminium salts. This metal&#8208;free procedure employs a combination of iodine(III) reagents with iodine and 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;en (DBU), providing particularly, S,S&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted sulfondiimines in up to 85&#8201;% yield. Mechanistically, electrophilic nitrene cations are suggested as the reactive intermediates.







Abstract
Sulfondiimines are marginalized entities among nitrogen&#8208;containing organosulfur compounds, despite offering promising properties for applications in various fields including medicinal and agrochemical. Herein, we present a metal&#8208;free and rapid synthetic procedure for the synthesis of N&#8208;monosubstituted sulfondiimines that overcomes current limitations in their synthetic accessibility. Particularly, S,S&#8208;dialkyl substrates, which are commonly difficult to convert by existing methods, react well with a combination of iodine, 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;en (DBU), and iminoiodinanes (PhINR) in acetonitrile (MeCN) to furnish the corresponding sulfondiimines in yields up to 85&#8201;% (25&#8197;examples). Valuable &#8220;free&#8221; NH&#8208;N&#8242;H&#8208;sulfondiimines can then be accessed by N&#8208;deprotection under mild reaction conditions. Several experimental observations suggest a mechanistic pathway diverging from the common radical&#8208;based iodine/iminoiodinane mechanism. Based on the experimental results in combination with data obtained by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, ESI mass spectrometry, and crystallographic analysis we propose a direct amination from PhINNs and a reaction path via a cationic iodonitrene.

         <title>Dynamic Axial&#8208;to&#8208;Helical Communication Mechanism in Poly[(allenylethynylenephenylene)acetylene]s under External Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helix inversion of chiral poly[(allenylethynylenephenylene)acetylenes was induced by a dynamic axial&#8208;to&#8208;helical communication mechanism. It was produced by on/off supramolecular interactions between conformationally rigid chiral pendants and bulky molecules.







Abstract
Helix inversion in chiral dynamic helical polymers is usually achieved by conformational changes at the pendant groups induced through external stimuli. Herein, a different mechanism of helix inversion in poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) is presented, based on the activation/deactivation of supramolecular interactions. We prepared poly[(allenylethynylenephenylene)acetylene]s (PAEPAs) in which the pendant groups are conformationally locked chiral allenes. Therefore, their substituents are placed in specific spatial orientations. As a result, the screw sense of a PAEPA is fixed by the allenyl substituent with the optimal size/distance relationship to the backbone. This helical sense command can be surpassed by supramolecular interactions between another substituent on the allene and appropriate external stimuli, such as amines. So, a helix inversion occurs through a novel axial&#8208;to&#8208;helical communication mechanism, opening a new scenario for taming the helices of chiral dynamic helical polymers.

         <title>Insights into Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on SnS2: Main Product Switch from Hydrogen to Formate by Pulsed Potential Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing S&#8208;vacancy into SnS2 (Vs&#8208;SnS2) can significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity of CO2RR but it exhibits an exclusive H2 evolution under static potential electrolysis. Pulsed potential electrolysis can make the catalysts undergo in situ generation of partially oxidized SnS2&#8722;x that leads to a main product switched from hydrogen to formate during the CO2RR with the oxide phase selective to formate and the S&#8208;vacancy to H2.







Abstract
Tin disulfide (SnS2) is a promising candidate for electrosynthesis of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate while the low activity and selectivity remain a great challenge. Herein, we report the potentiostatic and pulsed potential CO2RR performance of SnS2 nanosheets (NSs) with tunable S&#8208;vacancy and exposure of Sn&#8208;atoms or S&#8208;atoms prepared controllably by calcination of SnS2 at different temperatures under the H2/Ar atmosphere. The catalytic activity of S&#8208;vacancy SnS2 (Vs&#8208;SnS2) is improved 1.8&#8197;times, but it exhibits an exclusive hydrogen evolution with about 100&#8201;% FE under all potentials investigated in the static conditions. The theoretical calculations reveal that the adsorption of *H on the Vs&#8208;SnS2 surface is energetically more favorable than the carbonaceous intermediates, resulting in active site coverage that hinders the carbon intermediates from being adsorbed. Fortunately, the main product can be switched from hydrogen to formate by applying pulsed potential electrolysis benefiting from in situ formed partially oxidized SnS2&#8722;x with the oxide phase selective to formate and the S&#8208;vacancy to hydrogen. This work highlights not only the Vs&#8208;SnS2 NSs lead to exclusively H2 formation, but also provides insights into the systematic design of highly selective CO2 reduction catalysts reconstructed by pulsed potential electrolysis.

         <title>A General Autofluorescence Method to Characterize Polymerization Progress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potentially general autofluorescence method that does not rely on traditional fluorogenic functional groups enables real&#8208;time/in&#8208;line spectroscopic monitoring of polymerization progress. Fluorescence lifetime recovery after photobleaching (FLRAP) is developed and demonstrated. Changes in (auto)fluorescence lifetime recovery after photobleaching correlate linearly with polymer degree of cure.







Abstract
An autofluorescence technique to characterize polymerization progress in real time/in line was developed, which functioned in the absence of typical fluorogenic groups on the monomer or polymer. The monomer dicyclopentadiene and polymer polydicyclopentadiene are hydrocarbons that lack traditional functional groups for fluorescence spectroscopy. Here, the autofluorescence of formulations containing this monomer and polymer during ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) was harnessed for reaction monitoring. The methods fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and here&#8208;developed fluorescence lifetime recovery after photobleaching (FLRAP) characterized polymerization progress in these native systems&#8212;without requiring exogenous fluorophore. (Auto)fluorescence lifetime recovery changes during polymerization correlated linearly to degree of cure, providing a quantitative link with reaction progress. These changing signals also provided relative rates of background polymerization, enabling comparison of 10 different catalyst&#8208;inhibitor&#8208;stabilized formulations. Multiple&#8208;well analysis demonstrated suitability for future high&#8208;throughput evaluation of formulations for thermosets. The central concept of the combined autofluorescence and FLRAP/FRAP method may be extendable to monitoring other polymerization reactions previously overlooked for lack of an obvious fluorescence handle.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional LDH Film Templating for Controlled Preparation and Performance Enhancement of Polyamide Nanofiltration Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered double hydroxides (LDH) intermediate layer facilitates controlled interfacial polymerization between trimesoyl chloride and piperazine, which results in two membranes with good separation performances towards salts and dyes. Due to the low water transport resistance of the LDH layer and the thinner polyamide layer, the composite membrane has a larger flux, which is a breakthrough in the trade&#8208;off between permeance and selectivity.







Abstract
Tailored design of high&#8208;performance nanofiltration membranes that can be used in a variety of applications such as water desalination, resource recovery, and sewage treatment is desirable. Herein, we describe the use of layered double hydroxides (LDH) intermediate layer to control the interfacial polymerization between trimesoyl chloride (TMC) and piperazine (PIP) for the preparation of polyamide (PA) membrane. The dense surface of LDH layer and its unique mass transfer behavior influence the diffusion of PIP, and the supporting role of the LDH layer allows the formation of ultrathin PA membranes. By only changing the concentration of PIP, a series of membranes with controllable thickness from 10 to 50&#8197;nm and tunable crosslinking&#8208;degree can be prepared. The membrane prepared with a higher concentration of PIP shows excellent performance for divalent salt retention with water permeance of 28&#8197;Lm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1, high rejection of 95.1&#8201;% for MgCl2 and 97.1&#8201;% for Na2SO4. While the membrane obtained with a lower concentration of PIP can sieve dye molecules of different sizes with a flux of up to 70&#8201;Lm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1. This work demonstrates a novel strategy for the controllable preparation of high&#8208;performance nanofiltration membranes and provides new insights into how the intermediate layer affects the IP reaction and the final separation performance.

         <title>Synthesis of a Blue&#8208;Emissive Azaborathia[9]helicene by Silicon&#8208;Boron Exchange from Unusual Atropisomeric Teraryls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A blue&#8208;emissive azaborathia[9]helicene was synthesized from atropoisomeric triisopropylsilyl&#8208;substituted teraryls with nearly parallel oriented isoquinoline moieties via silicon&#8208;boron exchange, a new method for the preparation of azaboroles. The target helicene, consisting of two thienoazaborole motifs, shows excellent configurational stability and a luminescence quantum yield of 0.17.







Abstract
We report the concise synthesis and chir(optical) properties of an azaborathia[9]helicene consisting of two thienoazaborole motifs. The key intermediate, a highly congested teraryl with nearly parallel isoquinoline moieties, was generated as a mixture of atropisomers upon fusion of the central thiophene ring of the dithienothiophene moiety. These diastereomers were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealing intriguing interactions in the solid state. Subsequent insertion of boron into the aromatic scaffold via silicon&#8208;boron exchange involving triisopropylsilyl groups fixed the helical geometry, thereby establishing a novel method for the preparation of azaboroles. The ligand exchange at boron in the final step afforded the blue emitter displaying a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.17 in CH2Cl2 and excellent configurational stability. Detailed structural and theoretical investigation of unusual atropisomers and the helicene provide insights into their isomerization processes.

         <title>Rashba Band Splitting and Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Induced by Halogen Bonds in Hybrid Layered Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a new series of 2D perovskites featuring thickness&#8208;dependent hydrogen and halogen bonding interactions. The strength of non&#8208;covalent interaction shows direct impacts to the structure symmetry and optoelectronic properties. Stronger halogen interaction leads to centrosymmetry, whereas weaker halogen bonds give rise to non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures, Rashba splitting, suppressed radiative recombination, and bulk photovoltaic effect.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent interactions play an essential role in directing the self&#8208;assembly of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic crystals. In hybrid halide perovskites, hydrogen bonding has been the paramount non&#8208;covalent interaction. Here, we show another non&#8208;covalent interaction, namely, the halogen bond interaction, that directs a symmetry&#8208;breaking assembly in a new series of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites (ICH2CH2NH3)2(CH3NH3)n&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n is the layer thickness, n=1&#8211;4). Structural analysis shows that the halogen bond strength varies with the layer thickness. For the odd number (n=1, 3) layered perovskites, stronger halogen interaction leads to centrosymmetric structures, whereas for the n=2 layered perovskites, weaker halogen bonds result in non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures. Transient reflection spectroscopy shows a suppressed radiative recombination rate (k2&#8776;0) and prolonged spin lifetime for n=2 structure, suggesting an enhanced Rashba band splitting effect. The structural asymmetry is further confirmed with a reversible bulk photovoltaic effect. Our work provides a new design strategy to enable hybrid perovskites with emerging properties and functionalities associated with structural asymmetry.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Bound Formates are Main Reaction Intermediates during CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol over Cu/ZrO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different types of formates were observed at the surface of a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst during the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. A Cu&#8208;bound formate representing only about 7&#8201;% of formates exhibited a high reactivity and was the only formate that could account for the production of methanol. The two other surface formates were located on the ZrO2 surface and exhibited significantly lower decomposition rates.







Abstract
Cu/ZrO2 is a promising catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. Reaction pathways involving formates or hydroxycarbonyls have been proposed. We show here that three different types of formates can be observed under reaction conditions at 220&#8201;&#176;C and 3&#8197;bar, one being located on metallic Cu and two others being bound to ZrO2. The surface concentrations of formates were determined through calibration curves and their reactivity measured during chemical transient experiments. The Cu&#8208;bound formate represented only about 7&#8201;% of surface formates, but exhibited a higher reactivity and was found to be the only formate that could account for all the production of methanol. Copper is thus not there only to activate H2, but also bears other crucial intermediates. This work reemphasizes that fully quantitative IR analyses and transient methods are required to unravel the role of surface species.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Biscyclopropanes Using Alkynes as Dicarbene Equivalents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral Rh2(II)&#8208;catalyzed double cyclopropanation of CF2H&#8208;substituted enyne with alkenes is reported. The bicyclopropanes with 4&#8211;5 vicinal stereocenters and 2&#8211;3 all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers were constructed with excellent stereoselectivity in one step. The method was extended to the cyclopropanation/cyclopropenation. In these processes, the functional alkyne is used as a dicarbene equivalent and 3 new rings are formed.







Abstract
Chiral biscyclopropanes are an important skeleton in many bioactive molecules. However, there are few routes to synthesize these molecules with high stereoselectivity due to the nature of multiple stereocenters. Herein, we report the first example of Rh2(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of bicyclopropanes with alkynes as dicarbene equivalents. The bicyclopropanes with 4&#8211;5 vicinal stereocenters and 2&#8211;3 all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers were constructed in excellent stereoselectivity. This protocol features high efficiency and excellent functional group tolerance. Moreover, the protocol was also extended to the cascaded cyclopropanation/cyclopropenation with excellent stereoselectivities. In these processes, both sp&#8208;carbons of alkyne were converted into stereogenic sp3&#8208;carbons. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the cooperative weak hydrogen bonds between the substrates and the dirhodium catalyst may play key roles in this reaction.

         <title>Biomimetic Nanocomposites Camouflaged with Hybrid Cell Membranes for Accurate Therapy of Early&#8208;Stage Glioma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid cell membranes (HMs) consisting of brain metastatic breast cancer cell membranes and glioma cell membranes were prepared and coated onto drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles. The obtained HMGINPs inherited good blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier penetration and homologous glioma targeting ability from the two types of source cells, and exhibited superior therapeutic efficacy against early&#8208;stage glioma.







Abstract
Glioma features high fatality rate and short survival time of patients due to its fast growth speed and high invasiveness, hence timely treatment of early&#8208;stage glioma is extremely important. However, the blood brain barrier (BBB) severely prevents therapeutic agents from entering the brain; meanwhile, the non&#8208;targeted distribution of agents always causes side effects to vulnerable cerebral tissues. Therefore, delivery systems that possess both BBB penetrability and precise glioma targeting ability are keenly desired. We herein proposed a hybrid cell membrane (HM) camouflage strategy to construct therapeutic nanocomposites, in which HM consisting of brain metastatic breast cancer cell membrane and glioma cell membrane was prepared with a simple membrane fusion pathway. By coating HM onto drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles, the as&#8208;obtained biomimetic therapeutic agent (termed HMGINPs) inherited satisfying BBB penetrability and homologous glioma targeting ability simultaneously from the two source cells. HMGINPs exhibited good biocompatibility and superior therapeutic efficacy towards early&#8208;stage glioma.

         <title>Tetrazole Diversification of Amino Acids and Peptides via Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Cycloaddition with Aryldiazonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general synthetic platform that could transform proteinogenic &#945;&#8208;amino acids into a plethora of unprecedented tetrazole&#8208;decorated amino acid derivatives is developed via a silver&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular cycloaddition reaction with aryldiazonium salts.







Abstract
Selective structural modification of amino acids and peptides is a central strategy in organic chemistry, chemical biology but also in pharmacology and material science. In this context, the formation of tetrazole rings, known to possess significant therapeutic properties, would expand the chemical space of unnatural amino acids but has received less attention. In this study, we demonstrated that the classic unimolecular Wolff rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;amino acid&#8208;derived diazoketones could be replaced by a faster intermolecular cycloaddition reaction with aryldiazonium salts under identical practical conditions. This strategy provides an efficient synthetic platform that could transform proteinogenic &#945;&#8208;amino acids into a plethora of unprecedented tetrazole&#8208;decorated amino acid derivatives with preservation of the stereocenters. Density functional theory studies shed some light on the reaction mechanism and provided information regarding the origins of the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Furthermore, this diazo&#8208;cycloaddition protocol was applied to construct tetrazole&#8208;modified peptidomimetics and drug&#8208;like amino acid derivatives.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Formal (4+1) Carbocyclization of Chalcones with Internal Alkynes via Rhodium(III) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcones can unusually serve as the precursors of acetophenones which then undergo formal (4+1) cyclization with internal alkynes via rhodium(III) catalysis in a regio&#8208; and chemoselective manner. 1&#8208;Indanones containing quaternary carbon centers along with reusable aryl aldehydes were formed by this annulation. This discovery enables a practical two&#8208;step protocol to indanones from the reaction of acetophenones with internal alkynes.







Abstract
A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization of chalcones with internal alkynes is reported, generating biologically important 3,3&#8208;disubstituted 1&#8208;indanones along with reusable aromatic aldehydes. This transformation features unique (4+1) reaction mode, excellent regioselectivity in alkyne insertion, broad substrate scope, allows for the construction of quaternary carbon centers, and is scalable. Steric hindrance from substrate and ligand probably controls the chemoselectivity of this carbocyclization. Importantly, this discovery enables a practical two&#8208;step protocol switching the overall reaction of acetophenones with internal alkynes from a (3+2) to a (4+1) annulation.

         <title>Ex situ Generation of Thiazyl Trifluoride (NSF3) as a Gaseous SuFEx Hub
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report a synthetic procedure for the efficient ex situ generation of thiazyl trifluoride gas (N&#8801;SF3) as a new Sulfur(VI)&#8208;Fluoride Exchange hub. In typical SuFEx fashion, this triple&#8208;bonded azasulfur(VI) fluoride reagent and its mono&#8208;substituted derivatives react highly effectively with various nucleophiles to deliver a library of unreported thiazynes.







Abstract
Sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) chemistry, an all&#8208;encompassing term for substitution events that replace fluoride at an electrophilic sulfur(VI), enables the rapid and flexible assembly of linkages around a SVI core. Although a myriad of nucleophiles and applications works very well with the SuFEx concept, the electrophile design has remained largely SO2&#8208;based. Here, we introduce S&#8801;N&#8208;based fluorosulfur(VI) reagents to the realm of SuFEx chemistry. Thiazyl trifluoride (NSF3) gas is shown to serve as an excellent parent compound and SuFEx hub to efficiently synthesize mono&#8208; and disubstituted fluorothiazynes in an ex situ generation workflow. Gaseous NSF3 was evolved from commercial reagents in a nearly quantitative fashion at ambient conditions. Moreover, the mono&#8208;substituted thiazynes could be extended further as SuFEx handles and be engaged in the synthesis of unsymmetrically disubstituted thiazynes. These results provide valuable insights into the versatility of these understudied sulfur functionalities paving the way for future applications.

         <title>1,3&#8208;Imidazole&#8208;Based Mesoionic Carbenes and Anionic Dicarbenes: Pushing the Limit of Classical N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoionic carbenes (iMICs) and anionic dicarbenes (ADCs) are readily accessible by the deprotonation of C2&#8208;arylated 1,3&#8208;imidazolium salts, which are prepared by the direct C2&#8208;arylation of classical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). The implications of iMICs as potent &#963;&#8208;donor ligands in organometallic catalysis and ADCs as unique building&#8208;blocks in accessing conceptually new main&#8208;group heterocycles with an annulated C4E2 ring are showcased.







Abstract
Classical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) featuring the carbene center at the C2&#8208;position of 1,3&#8208;imidazole framework (i.e. C2&#8208;carbenes) are well acknowledged as very versatile neutral ligands in molecular as well as in materials sciences. The efficiency and success of NHCs in diverse areas is essentially attributed to their persuasive stereoelectronics, in particular the potent &#963;&#8208;donor property. The NHCs with the carbene center at the unusual C4 (or C5) position, the so&#8208;called abnormal NHCs (aNHCs) or mesoionic carbenes (iMICs), are however superior &#963;&#8208;donors than C2&#8208;carbenes. Hence, iMICs have substantial potential in sustainable synthesis and catalysis. The main obstacle in this direction is rather demanding synthetic accessibility of iMICs. The aim of this review article is to highlight recent advances, particularly by the author's research group, in accessing stable iMICs, quantifying their properties, and exploring their applications in synthesis and catalysis. In addition, the synthetic viability and use of vicinal C4,C5&#8208;anionic dicarbenes (ADCs), also based on an 1,3&#8208;imidazole framework, are presented. As will be apparent on following pages, iMICs and ADCs hold potentials in pushing the limit of classical NHCs by enabling access to conceptually new main&#8208;group heterocycles, radicals, molecular catalysts, ligands sets, and more.

         <title>Photochemically&#8208;Driven CO2 Release Using a Metastable&#8208;State Photoacid for Energy Efficient Direct Air Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;demand CO2 release under ambient conditions using light instead of heat is achieved for simulated and amino acid&#8208;based direct air capture systems by regulating solution pHs via a photoinduced proton transfer of a reversible metastable&#8208;state photoacid, leading to energetically sustainable and economically feasible climate change mitigation solutions using solar energy.







Abstract
One of the grand challenges underlying current direct air capture (DAC) technologies relates to the intensive energy cost for sorbent regeneration and CO2 release, making the massive scale (GtCO2/year) deployment required to have a positive impact on climate change economically unfeasible. This challenge underscores the critical need to develop new DAC processes with substantially reduced regeneration energies. Here, we report a photochemically&#8208;driven approach for CO2 release by exploiting the unique properties of an indazole metastable&#8208;state photoacid (mPAH). Our measurements on simulated and amino acid&#8208;based DAC systems revealed the potential of mPAH to be used for CO2 release cycles by regulating pH changes and associated isomers driven by light. Upon irradiating with moderate intensity light, a &#8776;55&#8201;% and &#8776;68&#8201;% to &#8776;78&#8201;% conversion of total inorganic carbon to CO2 was found for the simulated and amino acid&#8208;based DAC systems, respectively. Our results confirm the feasibility of on&#8208;demand CO2 release under ambient conditions using light instead of heat, thereby providing an energy efficient pathway for the regeneration of DAC sorbents.

         <title>Manipulating Electron&#8208;Transfer Events in [Fe4Co4] Cubes via a Mixed&#8208;Ligand Approach: The Impact of Elastic Frustration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cyanide&#8208;bridged [Fe4Co4] cubes were prepared via a mixed&#8208;ligand approach. The molecular origins of their distinct (incomplete vs. complete) metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron transfer (MMET) properties were identified as the presence and absence of the inter&#8208;cluster alkynyl&#8208;alkynyl and CH/&#960; interactions. These compete with the cluster&#8208;anion interactions, resulting in the underlying elastic frustration and stopping the complete spin transition in 1.







Abstract
The engineering of intermolecular interaction is challenging but critical for magnetically switchable molecules. Here, we prepared two cyanide&#8208;bridged [Fe4Co4] cube complexes via the alkynyl&#8208; and alcohol&#8208;functionalized trispyrazoyl capping ligands. The alkynyl&#8208;functionalized complex 1 exhibited a thermally&#8208;induced incomplete metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron transfer (MMET) behaviour at around 220&#8197;K, while the mixed alkynyl/alcohol&#8208;functionalized cube of 2 showed a complete and abrupt MMET behaviour at 232&#8197;K. Remarkably, both compounds showed a long&#8208;lived photo&#8208;induced metastable state up to 200&#8197;K. The crystallographic study demonstrated that the incomplete transition of 1 was likely due to the possible elastic frustration originating from the competition between the anion&#8208;propagated elastic interactions and inter&#8208;cluster alkynyl&#8208;alkynyl &amp; CH&#8208;alkynyl interactions, whereas the latter are eliminated in 2 as a result of the partial substitution by the alcohol&#8208;functionalized ligand. Additionally, the introduction of chemically distinguishable cobalt centers within the cube unit of 2 did not lead to a two&#8208;step but a one&#8208;step transition, possibly because of the strong ferroelastic intramolecular interaction through the cyanide bridges.

         <title>Development of Tough Thermoplastic Elastomers by Leveraging Rigid&#8211;Flexible Supramolecular Segment Interplays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cooperative strategy for toughening thermoplastic elastomers without toughness&#8211;strength trade&#8208;off limitations is developed by leveraging the interplays between rigid and flexible supramolecular segments, resulting in the toughest (toughness 1.2&#8197;GJ&#8201;m&#8722;3) thermoplastic elastomer thus far. This work presents a general design principle for toughening polymer materials by mismatched supramolecular interactions.







Abstract
Supramolecular interactions facilitate the development of tough multifunctional thermoplastic elastomers. However, the fundamental principles that govern supramolecular toughening are barely understood, and the rational design to achieve the desired high toughness remains daunting. Herein, we report a simple and robust method for toughening thermoplastic elastomers by rationally tailoring hard&#8211;soft phase separation structures containing rigid and flexible supramolecular segments. The introduced functional segments with distinct structural rigidities provide mismatched supramolecular interactions to efficiently tune the energy dissipation and bear an external load. The optimal supramolecular elastomer containing aromatic amide and acylsemicarbazide moieties demonstrates a record toughness (1.2&#8197;GJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), extraordinary crack tolerance (fracture energy 282.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2), an ultrahigh true stress at break (2.3&#8197;GPa), good elasticity, healing ability, recyclability, and impact resistance. The toughening mechanism is validated by testing various elastomers, confirming the potential for designing and developing super&#8208;tough supramolecular materials with promising applications in aerospace and electronics.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Area Determination of Anisotropic Polymersomes by Amphiphilic Molecular Probe Loading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular probe loading method is developed to measure the surface area of anisotropic polymersomes in the shape of tube, disc, and stomatocyte. This method relies on the loading of an amphiphilic molecular probe onto the PEG corona of polymersomes as a monolayer. The surface area of anisotropic polymersomes is determined by the loading amount of probes.







Abstract
The surface area of anisotropic polymeric assemblies is a critical parameter concerning their properties. However, it is still a grand challenge for traditional techniques to determine the surface area. Here, a molecular probe loading (MPL) method is developed to measure the surface area of anisotropic polymersomes in the shape of tube, disc, and stomatocyte. This method uses an amphiphilic molecular probe, comprising hydrophobic pyrene as the anchor and hydrophilic tetraethylene glycol (EG4) as the float. The surface area of spherical polymersomes determined by dynamic light scattering is quantitatively correlated with the loading amount of probes, allowing the calculation of the average separation distance between the loaded probes. With the separation distance, we successfully determine the surface area of anisotropic polymersomes by measuring the loading amount. We envision that the MPL method will assist in the real&#8208;time surface area characterization, enabling the customization of functions.

         <title>A Kinetically Stabilized Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Triangulene Cation: Stable and NIR Fluorescent Diradical Cation with Triplet Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kinetically&#8208;stabilized nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene cation derivative has been synthesized and isolated. It is highly stable even in solution under air and has a triplet ground state with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. In contrast to the triangulene derivative, the nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene cation derivative exhibits near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission because the alternancy symmetry of triangulene is broken by the nitrogen cation.







Abstract
A kinetically&#8208;stabilized nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene cation derivative has been synthesized and isolated as the stable diradical with a triplet ground state that exhibits near&#8208;infrared emission. As was the case for a triangulene derivative we previously synthesized, the triplet ground state with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap was experimentally confirmed by magnetic measurements. In contrast to the triangulene derivative, the nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene cation derivative is highly stable even in solution under air and exhibits near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission because the alternancy symmetry of triangulene is broken by the nitrogen cation. Breaking the alternancy symmetry of triplet alternant hydrocarbon diradicals by a nitrogen cation would therefore be an effective strategy to create stable diradicals possessing magnetic properties similar to the parent hydrocarbons but with different electrochemical and photophysical properties.

Breaking the alternancy symmetry of triplet alternant hydrocarbon diradicals by a nitrogen cation would therefore be an effective strategy to create stable diradicals possessing magnetic properties similar to the parent hydrocarbons but with different electrochemical and photophysical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Cytotrienin A: Late&#8208;Stage Installation of C11 Side Chain onto the Macrolactam Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric total synthesis of cytotrienin A, an ansamycin antibiotic with apoptosis&#8208;inducing activity, is described. The strategic use of the redox properties of hydroquinone and the traceless Staudinger reaction enabled the late&#8208;stage installation of the C11 side chain, which plays a critical role in its biological activity, onto the macrolactam and opens new opportunities for the structure&#8211;activity relationship studies of ansamycin antibiotics.







Abstract
Cytotrienin A, an ansamycin&#8208;class antibiotic, exhibits potent apoptosis&#8208;inducing activity and has attracted much attention as a lead compound for anticancer drugs. Herein, we report a new asymmetric synthetic route to cytotrienin A, employing an unexplored approach involving the late&#8208;stage installation of a C11 side chain onto the macrolactam core. In this strategy, we utilized the redox properties of hydroquinone and installed a side chain on the sterically hindered C11 hydroxy group by the traceless Staudinger reaction. This study also demonstrated that the boron&#8208;Wittig/iterative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling sequence was effective for the concise and selective construction of the (E,E,E)&#8208;conjugated triene moiety. The developed route opens new opportunities for the structure&#8211;activity relationship studies of the side chains of these ansamycin antibiotics and the preparation of other synthetic analogs and chemical probes for further biological studies.

         <title>Non&#8208;canonical Biosynthesis of the Brexane&#8208;Type Bishomosesquiterpene Chlororaphen through Two Consecutive Methylation Steps in Pseudomonas chlororaphis O6 and Variovorax boronicumulans PHE5&#8208;4</title>

         <dc:description>
In the biosynthetic pathway of the first natural brexane&#8208;type compound, chlororaphen, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) is methylated and cyclized by a non&#8208;canonical FPP methyltransferase (FPP&#8208;MT), furnishing &#947;&#8208;presodorifen pyrophosphate (&#947;&#8208;PSPP). Methylation by the &#947;&#8208;PSPP&#8208;MT yields &#945;&#8208;prechlororaphen pyrophosphate (&#945;&#8208;PCPP), which is converted into the bishomosesquiterpene chlororaphen by the chlororaphen synthase (ChloS).







Abstract
A non&#8208;canonical biosynthetic pathway furnishing the first natural brexane&#8208;type bishomosesquiterpene (chlororaphen, C17H28) was elucidated in the &#947;&#8208;proteobacterium Pseudomonas chlororaphis O6. A combination of genome mining, pathway cloning, in vitro enzyme assays, and NMR spectroscopy revealed a three&#8208;step pathway initiated by C10 methylation of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP, C15) along with cyclization and ring contraction to furnish monocyclic &#947;&#8208;presodorifen pyrophosphate (&#947;&#8208;PSPP, C16). Subsequent C&#8208;methylation of &#947;&#8208;PSPP by a second C&#8208;methyltransferase furnishes the monocyclic &#945;&#8208;prechlororaphen pyrophosphate (&#945;&#8208;PCPP, C17), serving as the substrate for the terpene synthase. The same biosynthetic pathway was characterized in the &#946;&#8208;proteobacterium Variovorax boronicumulans PHE5&#8208;4, demonstrating that non&#8208;canonical homosesquiterpene biosynthesis is more widespread in the bacterial domain than previously anticipated.

         <title>Chemically Gradient Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Crystal Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a novel chemical gradient strategy to fabricate a crystal&#8208;deposited HOF on an in situ grown polymer film. The fabricated film showed versatility in chemical bonding along its thickness from covalent to hydrogen&#8208;bonded network and showed improved proton conductivity compared to its polymeric analog.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are ordered supramolecular solid structures, however, nothing much explored as centimetre&#8208;scale self&#8208;standing films. The fabrication of such crystals comprising self&#8208;supported films is challenging due to the limited flexibility and interaction of the crystals, and therefore studies on two&#8208;dimensional macrostructures of HOFs are limited to external supports. Herein, we introduce a novel chemical gradient strategy to fabricate a crystal&#8208;deposited HOF film on an in situ&#8208;formed covalent organic polymer film (Tam&#8208;Bdca&#8208;CGHOF). The fabricated film showed versatility in chemical bonding along its thickness from covalent to hydrogen&#8208;bonded network. The kinetic&#8208;controlled Tam&#8208;Bdca&#8208;CGHOF showed enhanced proton conductivity (8.3&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) compared to its rapid kinetic analogue, Tam&#8208;Bdca&#8208;COP (2.1&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), which signifies the advantage of bonding&#8208;engineering in the same system.

         <title>Regulated Ion/Electron&#8208;Conducting Interphase Enables Stable Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ions Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite anode of metallic zinc (Zn) with ion and electron&#8208;conducting interphase was prepared for Zn&#8208;ion batteries. This novel structure suppresses the side reactions and regulates the Zn deposition due to the fast ionic/electronic transport and high Young's modulus, thus achieving long&#8208;cycling aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Metallic Zinc (Zn) is considered as a remarkably promising anode for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to its high volumetric capacity and low redox potential. Unfortunately, dendritic growth and severe side reactions destabilizes the electrode/electrolyte interface, and ultimately reduce the electrochemical performance. Here, an artificial protective layer (APL) with a regulated ion and electron&#8208;conducting interphase is constructed on the Zn&#8208;metal anode to provide excellent interfacial stability in high&#8208;rate cycling. The superior ionic and moderate electronic conductivity of the APL derives from the co&#8208;embedding of MXene and Zn(CF3SO3)2 salts into the polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel, which enables a synergistic effect of local current density reduction during plating and ion transport acceleration during stripping for Zn anode. Furthermore, the high Young's modulus of the protective layer and dendrite&#8208;free deposition morphology during cycling suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions (2.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and passivation. As a result, in symmetrical cell tests, the modified battery presents a stable life of over 2000 cycles at ultra&#8208;high current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This research presents a new insight into the formation and regulation of stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface for the Zn&#8208;metal anode.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Free, Directing&#8208;Group&#8208;Free and Redox&#8208;Neutral &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Saturated Cyclic Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a powerful complement to existing organic amine catalysis, direct activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of saturated cyclic ketones is realized for the first time in an amine&#8208;free and directing&#8208;group&#8208;free catalytic mode. The carbonyl group binds to a defect site of the quantum dot (QD) surface, selectively weakening the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond, instead of the &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond, and exclusively generating an &#945;&#8208;C radical under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This unique activation platform leads to selective activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of cyclic ketones under redox&#8208;neutral conditions.

The activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of ketones typically requires an amine and a directing group to guide the reaction selectivity in amine&#8208;catalysis carbonyl chemistry. For an &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond activation of ketone, directing groups are also required to control the reaction selectivity. Reported herein is the first &#945;&#8208;alkylation of cyclic ketones in the absence of an amine catalyst and directing group. 1H&#8197;NMR, XPS, EPR studies and DFT calculations indicate that an &#945;&#8208;carbon radical intermediate is formed through direct and selective activation of the inert &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of ketones chelating on the surface of colloidal quantum dots (QDs). Such an interaction is essential for weakening the C&#8722;H bond, as exemplified, using CdSe QDs as the sole photocatalyst to execute &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H alkylation of cyclic ketones under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Without an amine catalyst and directing group, the high step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economy transformation under redox&#8208;neutral condition opens a new way for &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of ketones in carbonyl chemistry.

     alt="Amine-Free, Directing-Group-Free and Redox-Neutral &#945;-Alkylation of Saturated Cyclic Ketones"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a powerful complement to existing organic amine catalysis, direct activation of the &#945;-C&#8722;H bonds of saturated cyclic ketones is realized for the first time in an amine-free and directing-group-free catalytic mode. The carbonyl group binds to a defect site of the quantum dot (QD) surface, selectively weakening the &#945;-C&#8722;H bond, instead of the &#946;-C&#8722;H bond, and exclusively generating an &#945;-C radical under visible-light irradiation. This unique activation platform leads to selective activation of the &#945;-C&#8722;H bonds of cyclic ketones under redox-neutral conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Annulative &#960;&#8208;Extension by Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Ketone&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Activation: Rapid Access to Pyrenes and Related Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)</title>

         <dc:description>
An annulative &#960;&#8208;extension (APEX) method is reported to build a benzene ring at the masked bay&#8208;region of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) under RhIII&#8208;catalysis. This one&#8208;pot, ketone&#8208;directed C&#8722;H activation/annulation reaction between a ketone and an alkyne selectively provides challenging 4,5&#8208;disubstituted pyrenes, and optically pure bipyrene derivatives.







Abstract
Annulative &#960;&#8208;extension (APEX) reaction has become a powerful tool for the precise synthesis of well&#8208;defined polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as nanographene, graphene, and other PAHs possessing unique structure. Herein, an APEX reaction has been realized at the masked bay&#8208;region for the efficient and rapid synthesis of valuable PAH, pyrene, bearing substitutions at the most challenging K&#8208;region. RhIII&#8208;catalyzed ketone&#8208;directed C&#8722;H activation at the peri&#8208;position of a naphthyl&#8208;derived ketone, alkyne&#8208;insertion, intramolecular nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl&#8208;group, dehydration, and aromatization steps occurred in one&#8208;pot to effectuate the protocol. Employing this strategy, a two&#8208;fold APEX reaction on enantiopure BINOL&#8208;derived ketones provided access to axially&#8208;chiral bipyrene derivatives. The detailed DFT study to support proposed mechanism, and synthesis of helical PAHs like dipyrenothiophene and dipyrenofuran are other highlights of the present study.

         <title>Efficient Selective Oxidation of Aromatic Alkanes by Double Cobalt Active Sites over Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;rich Mesoporous Co3O4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich mesoporous Co3O4 (mCo3O4) were synthesized by a simple ligand&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly method. Benefits from abundant oxygen vacancies and well mesoporous structure of mCo3O4, a unique catalytic path was presented with direct oxidation of aromatic alkanes to aromatic ketones rather than the conventional stepwise oxidation to alcohols and then to ketones.







Abstract
The development of efficient catalyst for selective oxidation of hydrocarbon to functional compounds remains a challenge. Herein, mesoporous Co3O4 (mCo3O4&#8208;350) showed excellent catalytic activity for selective oxidation of aromatic&#8208;alkanes, especially for oxidation of ethylbenzene with a conversion of 42&#8201;% and selectivity of 90&#8201;% for acetophenone at 120&#8201;&#176;C. Notably, mCo3O4 presented a unique catalytic path of direct oxidation of aromatic&#8208;alkanes to aromatic ketones rather than the conventional stepwise oxidation to alcohols and then to ketones. Density functional theory calculations revealed that oxygen vacancies in mCo3O4 activate around Co atoms, causing electronic state change from Co3+(Oh)&#8594;Co2+(Oh). Co2+(Oh) has great attraction to ethylbenzene, and weak interaction with O2, which provide insufficient O2 for gradual oxidation of phenylethanol to acetophenone. Combined with high energy barrier for forming phenylethanol, the direct oxidation path from ethylbenzene to acetophenone is kinetically favorable on mCo3O4, sharply contrasted to non&#8208;selective oxidation of ethylbenzene on commercial Co3O4.

         <title>Solar Light Driven H2O2 Production and Selective Oxidations Using a Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalyst Prepared by a Multicomponent Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent organic framework (COF) prepared via the multicomponent Povarov reaction shows a high and long&#8208;term stable activity for photocatalytic H2O2 production and size&#8208;selective photocatalytic oxidation. The COF can be further used as photocatalyst for a range of important aerobic oxidation reactions including the conversion of alcohols to aldehydes, amines to imines and sulfides to sulfoxides.







Abstract
A chemically stable 2D microporous COF (PMCR&#8208;1) was synthesized via the multicomponent Povarov reaction. PMCR&#8208;1 exhibits a remarkable and long&#8208;term stable photocatalytic H2O2 production rate (60&#8197;h) from pure and sea water under visible light. The H2O2 production is markedly enhanced when benzyl alcohol (BA) is added as reductant, which is also due to a strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction of BA with dangling phenyl moieties in the COF pores introduced by the multicomponent Povarov reaction. Motivated by the concomitant BA oxidation to benzaldehyde during H2O2 formation, the photocatalytic oxidation of various organic substrates such as benzyl amine and methyl sulfide derivatives was investigated. It is shown that the well&#8208;defined micropores of PMCR&#8208;1 enable size&#8208;selective photocatalytic oxidation.

         <title>Imaging the Footprint of Nanoscale Electrochemical Reactions for Assessing Synergistic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a new optical microscopy technique to measure the synergistic effect of metal hydroxide coatings on the hydrogen evolution reaction at the individual particle level in neutral media. The technique involves using hydroxide halo formation as a footprint of the reaction, and can provide real&#8208;time operando quantification of catalytic activity.







Abstract
This work proposes a novel method for measuring the intrinsic activity of single metal&#8208;based nanoparticles towards water reduction in neutral media at industrially relevant current densities. Instead of using gas nanobubbles as proxy, the method uses optical microscopy to track the local footprint of the reaction through the precipitation of metal hydroxide, which is associated to the local pH increase during electrocatalysis. The results show the electrocatalytic activities of different types of metal nanoparticles and bifunctionnal core&#8208;shell nanostructures made of Ni and Pt, and demonstrate the importance of metal hydroxide nano&#8208;shells in enhancing electrocatalysis. This method should be generalizable to any electrocatalytic reaction involving pH changes such as nitrate or CO2 reduction.

         <title>Bioinspired Single&#8208;Atom Sites Enable Efficient Oxygen Activation for Switching Anodic/Cathodic Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring axial coordination of Fe sites for charge redistribution realizes efficient and selective catalytic O2 activation to generate specific active intermediates. Highly active hydroxyl radicals produced by axial N&#8208;involved systems enable direct cathodic electrochemiluminescence, while C&#8208;decorated catalysts preferentially form superoxide anion radicals and only present anodic luminescence.







Abstract
Exploring advanced co&#8208;reaction accelerators with superior oxygen reduction activity that generate rich reactive oxygen species (ROS) has attracted great attention in boosting luminol&#8208;O2 electrochemiluminescence (ECL). However, tuning accelerators for efficient and selective catalytic O2 activation to switch anodic/cathodic ECL is very challenging. Herein, we report that enzyme&#8208;inspired Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts with axial N/C coordination structures (FeN5, FeN4&#169; SACs) can generate specific ROS for cathodic/anodic ECL conversion. Mechanistic studies reveal that FeN5 sites prefer to produce highly active hydroxyl radicals and afford direct cathodic luminescence by promoting the cleavage of O&#8722;O bonds through N&#8208;induced electron redistribution. In contrast, FeN4&#169; sites tend to produce superoxide radicals, resulting in inefficient anodic ECL. Benefiting from the enhanced cathodic ECL, FeN5 SAC&#8208;based immunosensor was constructed for the sensitive detection of cancer biomarkers.

         <title>Amplified Chirality Transfer to Aromatic Molecules through Non&#8208;specific Inclusion by Amorphous, Hyperbranched Poly(fluorenevinylene) Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active, hyperbranched poly(fluorenevinylene) derivatives have been shown to include aromatic small molecules in their interior space. These small molecules form liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;like intermolecular arrangements and exhibit clear circular dichroism and efficient circularly polarized luminescence with remarkably amplified anisotropy.







Abstract
Optically active, hyperbranched, poly(fluorene&#8208;2,4,7&#8208;triylethene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diyl) [poly(fluorenevinylene)] derivatives bearing a neomenthyl group and a pentyl group at the 9&#8208;position of the fluorene backbone at various ratios acted as a chirality donor (host polymers) efficiently included naphthalene, anthracene, pyrene, 9&#8208;phenylanthracene, and 9,10&#8208;diphenyanthracene as a chirality acceptor (guest molecules) in their interior space in film as well as in solution, with the guest molecules exhibiting intense circular dichroism through chirality transfer with chirality amplification. The efficiency of the chirality transfer was much higher with higher&#8208;molar&#8208;mass polymers than lower&#8208;molar&#8208;mass ones as well as with hyperbranched polymers compared to the analogous linear ones. The hyperbranched polymers include the small molecules in their complex structure without any specific interactions at various stoichiometries. The included molecules may have ordered intermolecular arrangement that may be somewhat similar to those of liquid crystals. Naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene included in the polymer exhibited efficient circularly polarized luminescence, where the chirality was remarkably amplified in excited states, and anthracene exhibited especially high anisotropies in the emission on the order of 10&#8722;2.

         <title>Evidence of a Uranium&#8208;Paddlewheel Node in a Catecholate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through solvothermal combination of uranyl and a redox&#8208;active linker, we reduced the U&#8722;O bonds and subsequently formed a metal&#8208;organic framework built from a uranium paddlewheel node. This paddlewheel node, where two uranium atoms are connected by four hexahydroxytriphenylene species and capped with water moieties, is unprecedented.







Abstract
The interactions between uranium and non&#8208;innocent organic species are an essential component of fundamental uranium redox chemistry. However, they have seldom been explored in the context of multidimensional, porous materials. Uranium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer a new angle to study these interactions, as these self&#8208;assembled species stabilize uranium species through immobilization by organic linkers within a crystalline framework, while potentially providing a method for adjusting metal oxidation state through coordination of non&#8208;innocent linkers. We report the synthesis of the MOF NU&#8208;1700, assembled from U4+&#8208;paddlewheel nodes and catecholate&#8208;based linkers. We propose this highly unusual structure, which contains two U4+ ions in a paddlewheel built from four linkers&#8212;a first among uranium materials&#8212;as a result of extensive characterization via powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), sorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), in addition to density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>The Influence of Regiochemistry on the Performance of Organic Mixed Ionic and Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigating the influence of sidechain regiochemistry on a series of thiophene&#8208;based mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting polymers, the degree of conformational disorder is found to be a crucial indicator of performance. Maximising non&#8208;covalent planarising interactions and polaronic charge delocalisation during molecular design must consequently be carefully weighed against considerations around conformational restrictions.







Abstract
Thiophenes functionalised in the 3&#8208;position are ubiquitous building blocks for the design and synthesis of organic semiconductors. Their non&#8208;centrosymmetric nature has long been used as a powerful synthetic design tool exemplified by the vastly different properties of regiorandom and regioregular poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) owing to the repulsive head&#8208;to&#8208;head interactions between neighbouring side chains in the regiorandom polymer. The renewed interest in highly electron&#8208;rich 3&#8208;alkoxythiophene based polymers for bioelectronic applications opens up new considerations around the regiochemistry of these systems as both the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail and head&#8208;to&#8208;head couplings adopt near&#8208;planar conformations due to attractive intramolecular S&#8722;O interactions. To understand how this increased flexibility in the molecular design can be used advantageously, we explore in detail the geometrical and electronic effects that influence the optical, electrochemical, structural, and electrical properties of a series of six polythiophene derivatives with varying regiochemistry and comonomer composition. We show how the interplay between conformational disorder, backbone coplanarity and polaron distribution affects the mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conduction. Ultimately, we use these findings to identify a new conformationally restricted polythiophene derivative for p&#8208;type accumulation&#8208;mode organic electrochemical transistor applications with performance on par with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mixed conductors evidenced by a &#956;C* product of 267&#8197;F&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

         <title>Elucidating the Structures of Intermediate Fragments during Stepwise Dissociation of Monolayer&#8208;Protected Silver Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trapped ion mobility mass spectrometry, combined with theoretical calculations, is used to resolve the structures of intermediate fragments produced upon dissociation of atomically precise silver clusters in the gas&#8208;phase, which has remained challenging using other methodologies.







Abstract
Fragmentation dynamics of ligated coinage metal clusters reflects their structural and bonding properties. So far methodological challenges limited probing structures of the fragments. Herein, we resolve the geometric structures of the primary fragments of [Ag29L12]3&#8722;, i.e. [Ag24L9]2&#8722;, [Ag19L6]&#8722; and [Ag5L3]&#8722; (L is 1,3&#8208;benzene dithiolate). For this, we used trapped ion mobility mass spectrometry to determine collision cross sections of the fragments and compared them to structures calculated by density functional theory. We also report that following two sequential [Ag5L3]&#8722; elimination steps, further dissociation of [Ag19L6]&#8722; also involves a new channel of Ag2 loss and Ag&#8722;S and C&#8722;S bond cleavages. This reflects a competition between retaining the electronic stability of 8&#8201;e&#8722; superatom cluster cores and increasing steric strain of ligands and staples. These results are also of potential interest for future soft&#8208;landing deposition studies aimed at probing catalytic behavior of Ag clusters on supports.

Herein, we resolve the geometric structures of the primary fragments of [Ag&lt;sub&gt;29&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. [Ag&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, [Ag&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [Ag&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (L is 1,3-benzene dithiolate). For this, we used trapped ion mobility mass spectrometry to determine collision cross sections of the fragments and compared them to structures calculated by density functional theory. We also report that following two sequential [Ag&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; elimination steps, further dissociation of [Ag&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; also involves a new channel of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loss and Ag&#8722;S and C&#8722;S bond cleavages. This reflects a competition between retaining the electronic stability of 8&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; superatom cluster cores and increasing steric strain of ligands and staples. These results are also of potential interest for future soft-landing deposition studies aimed at probing catalytic behavior of Ag clusters on supports.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase Transition Engineering of Host Perovskite toward Optimal Exsolution&#8208;facilitated Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have implemented a set of strategies to precisely control the phase evolution of host perovskite without compromising exsolution. Using carbon dioxide electrolysis as an example, we demonstrated how regulating phase structure can enhance the activity and stability of exsolved perovskites, emphasizing the importance of phase evolution control in catalytic chemistry occurring on perovskites with exsolution.







Abstract
The in situ exsolution technique of nanoparticles has brought new opportunities for the utilization of perovskite&#8208;based catalysts in solid oxide cells. However, the lack of control over the structural evolution of host perovskites during the promotion of exsolution has restricted the architectural exploitation of exsolution&#8208;facilitated perovskites. In this study, we strategically broke the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off phenomenon between promoted exsolution and suppressed phase transition via B&#8208;site supplement, thus broadening the scope of exsolution&#8208;facilitated perovskite materials. Using carbon dioxide electrolysis as an illustrative case study, we demonstrate that the catalytic activity and stability of perovskites with exsolved nanoparticles (P&#8208;eNs) can be selectively enhanced by regulating the explicit phase of host perovskites, accentuating the critical role of the architectures of perovskite scaffold in catalytic reactions occurring on P&#8208;eNs. The concept demonstrated could potentially pave the way for designing the advanced exsolution&#8208;facilitated P&#8208;eNs materials and unveiling a wide range of catalytic chemistry taking place on P&#8208;eNs.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Sculponin&#8197;U through a Photoinduced Radical Cascade Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of sculponin&#8197;U, a C20&#8208;oxygenated kaurane diterpenoid, was completed. The hexanone&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton was strategically established by a photoinduced electron transfer, generating a cationic radical intermediate from a silyl enolate.







Abstract
We have accomplished the total synthesis of sculponin&#8197;U, a polycyclic C&#8208;20&#8208;oxygenated kaurane diterpenoid featuring a 7,20&#8208;lactone&#8208;hemiketal bridge, through a radical cascade cyclization triggered by photoinduced electron transfer (PET) of a silyl enolate to form the cyclohexanone&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton. Other key points in our synthetic strategy encompass a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to construct the middle six&#8208;membered ring of sculponin&#8197;U, and an intramolecular radical cyclization induced by iron&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer to close the western cyclohexane ring. Successful preparation of the enantiopure silyl enolate as the PET precursor enables the asymmetric total synthesis of sculponin&#8197;U, opening a new avenue for divergent syntheses of structurally related C&#8208;20&#8208;oxygenated kaurane congeners and pharmaceutical derivatives thereof.

         <title>Assembling a Heterobimetallic Actinide Metal&#8208;Organic Framework by a Reaction&#8208;Induced Preorganization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the unique architecture of the largest&#8208;unit&#8208;cell thorium metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), a second actinide, uranyl, with dintinct coordination behaviour was successfully assembled into the framework via a novel reaction&#8208;induced preorganization strategy to yield a rare single crystalline heterobimetallic actinide MOF.







Abstract
Periodically arranging coordination&#8208;distinct actinides into one crystalline architecture is intriguing but of great synthetic challenge. We report a rare example of a heterobimetallic actinide metal&#8211;organic framework (An&#8208;MOF) by a unique reaction&#8208;induced preorganization strategy. A thorium MOF (SCU&#8208;16) with the largest unit cell among all Th&#8208;MOFs was prepared as the precursor, then the uranyl was precisely embedded into the MOF precursor under oxidation condition. Single crystal of the resulting thorium&#8208;uranium MOF (SCU&#8208;16&#8208;U) shows that a uranyl&#8208;specific site was in situ induced by the formate&#8208;to&#8208;carbonate oxidation reaction. The heterobimetallic SCU&#8208;16&#8208;U exhibits multifunction catalysis properties derived from two distinct actinides. The strategy proposed here offers a new avenue to create mixed&#8208;actinide functional material with unique architecture and versatile functionality.

         <title>Thiol&#8208;Aldehyde Polycondensation for Bio&#8208;based Adaptable and Degradable Phenolic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lignin and synthetic phenolic polymers are difficult to degrade and reprocess. Through thiol&#8208;aldehyde polycondensation, degradable and reprocessable phenolic polymers with tensile strength up to 64&#8197;MPa were prepared from bioderived phenolic compounds. The developed method is promising for facile preparation of macromolecular antioxidants and dynamic networks.







Abstract
Designing sustainable materials with tunable mechanical properties, intrinsic degradability, and recyclability from renewable biomass through a mild process has become vital in polymer science. Traditional phenolic resins are generally considered to be not degradable or recyclable. Here we report the design and synthesis of linear and network structured phenolic polymers using facile polycondensation between natural aldehyde&#8208;bearing phenolic compounds and polymercaptans. Linear phenolic products are amorphous with Tg between &#8722;9&#8201;&#176;C and 12&#8201;&#176;C. Cross&#8208;linked networks from vanillin and its di&#8208;aldehyde derivative exhibited excellent mechanical strength between 6&#8211;64&#8197;MPa. The connecting dithioacetals are associatively adaptable strong bonds and susceptible to degradation in oxidative conditions to regenerate vanillin. These results highlight the potential of biobased sustainable phenolic polymers with recyclability and selective degradation, as a complement to the traditional phenol&#8208;formaldehyde resins.

&#8220;The Ebenhan Lab saw work on positron emission tomography as an initiative suitable for extending antimicrobial research for more tailored African solutions to African problems&#8230; No such work would be possible without team effort, which, in our case, is a prime example for interdisciplinarity, since our staff comes from varied disciplines and areas of know&#8208;how.&#8220; Find out more about collaborative work on PET imaging led by the Ebenhan Lab, Nuclear Medicine Research Infrastructure (South Africa).







Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Ebenhan Lab (Professor Thomas Ebenhan and Professor Jan Rijn Zeevaart) at the Preclinical Imaging Facility, Nuclear Medicine Research Infrastructure (NuMeRI) NPC, Pretoria (South Africa) in collaboration with Arno C. Gouws, Professor Hendrik&#8197;G. Kruger, and Professor Tricia Naicker from the Catalysis and Peptide Research Unit at the University of KwaZulu Natal, Durban (South Africa); Professor Olivier Gheysens from the Department of Nuclear Medicine, Cliniques Universitaires Saint&#8208;Luc and Institute of Clinical and Experimental Research, Universit&#233; Catholique de Louvain, Brussels (Belgium); and ProfessorThavendran Govender from the Department of Chemistry, University of Zululand, KwaDlangezwa (South Africa). Researchers at these institutes have a 10&#8208;year track record of joint publications. The review written by this collaboration provides a summary of the relevant antibiotic&#8208;derived PET radiotracers, grouped either by radiotracer development for infection imaging, or radio&#8208;antibiotic PET imaging for pharmacologic drug characterization. The review includes a critical, in&#8208;depth evaluation, addressing the challenges and pitfalls of developing antibiotic&#8208;derived PET radiotracers as infection imaging agents. &#8220;Antibiotic&#8208;Derived Radiotracers for Positron Emission Tomography: Nuclear or &#8216;Unclear' Infection Imaging?&#8221;, A.&#8197;C.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#8220;The Ebenhan Lab saw work on positron emission tomography as an initiative suitable for extending antimicrobial research for more tailored African solutions to African problems&#8230; No such work would be possible without team effort, which, in our case, is a prime example for interdisciplinarity, since our staff comes from varied disciplines and areas of know-how.&#8220;&lt;/i&gt; Find out more about collaborative work on PET imaging led by the Ebenhan Lab, Nuclear Medicine Research Infrastructure (South Africa).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This invited Team Profile was created by the Ebenhan Lab (Professor Thomas Ebenhan and Professor Jan Rijn Zeevaart) at the Preclinical Imaging Facility, &lt;a href="https://sanumeri.co.za/preclinical/"&gt;Nuclear Medicine Research Infrastructure (NuMeRI)&lt;/a&gt; NPC, Pretoria (South Africa) in collaboration with Arno C. Gouws, Professor Hendrik&#8197;G. Kruger, and Professor Tricia Naicker from the Catalysis and Peptide Research Unit at the University of KwaZulu Natal, Durban (South Africa); Professor Olivier Gheysens from the Department of Nuclear Medicine, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc and Institute of Clinical and Experimental Research, Universit&#233; Catholique de Louvain, Brussels (Belgium); and ProfessorThavendran Govender from the Department of Chemistry, University of Zululand, KwaDlangezwa (South Africa). Researchers at these institutes have a 10-year track record of joint publications. The review written by this collaboration provides a summary of the relevant antibiotic-derived PET radiotracers, grouped either by radiotracer development for infection imaging, or radio-antibiotic PET imaging for pharmacologic drug characterization. The review includes a critical, in-depth evaluation, addressing the challenges and pitfalls of developing antibiotic-derived PET radiotracers as infection imaging agents. &lt;i&gt;&#8220;Antibiotic-Derived Radiotracers for Positron Emission Tomography: Nuclear or &#8216;Unclear' Infection Imaging&lt;/i&gt;?&#8221;, A.&#8197;C.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron Transfer from Xanthates to Acyl Azoliums: Divergent Ketone Synthesis via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering the prevalence of alcohols and carboxylic acids, their fragment cross&#8208;coupling reactions could hold significant implications in organic synthesis. Herein, we report a versatile method for synthesizing a diverse range of ketones from alcohols and carboxylic acid derivatives via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that photoexcited xanthates and acyl azoliums undergo single electron transfer (SET) under photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions, generating NHC&#8208;derived ketyl radicals and alkyl radicals. These open&#8208;shell intermediates subsequently undergo the radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction, yielding valuable ketones. Furthermore, this approach can be employed in three&#8208;component reactions involving alkenes and enynes, resulting in structurally diverse cross&#8208;coupled ketones. The unified strategy offers a unique opportunity for the fragment coupling of a diverse range of alcohols and carboxylic acid derivatives, accommodating diverse functional groups even in complex settings.</dc:description>

         <title>Design Rules for Two&#8208;Dimensional Organic Semiconductor&#8208;Incorporated Perovskites (OSiP) Gleaned from Thousands of Simulated Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halide perovskites are an attractive class of hybrid perovskites that have additional optoelectronic tunability due to their accommodation of relatively large organic ligands. Nevertheless, contemporary ligand design depends on either expensive trial&#8208;and&#8208;error testing of whether a ligand can be integrated within the lattice or conservative heuristics that unduly limit the scope of ligand chemistries. Here, the structural determinants of stable ligand incorporation within Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) phase perovskites are established by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of over ten&#8208;thousand RP&#8208;phase perovskites and training of machine learning classifiers capable of predicting structural stability based solely on generalizable ligand features. The simulation results show near&#8208;perfect predictions of positive and negative literature examples, predict trade&#8208;offs between several ligand features and stability, and ultimately predict an inexhaustibly large 2D&#8208;compatible ligand design&#8208;space.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic &#963;&#8208;Bond Annulation with Ambiphilic Organohalides Enabled by &#946;&#8208;X Elimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a catalytic cascade sequence involving directed C(sp3)&#8211;H activation followed by &#946;&#8208;heteroatom elimination to generate a PdII(&#960;&#8208;alkene) intermediate which then undergoes redox&#8208;neutral annulation with an ambiphilic aryl halide to access 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered (hetero)cycles. Various alkyl C(sp3)&#8211;oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur bonds can be selectively activated, and the annulation proceeds with high diastereoselectivity. The method enables modification of amino acids with good retention of enantiomeric excess, as well as &#963;&#8208;bond ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing transfiguration with low&#8208;strain heterocycles. Despite the mechanistic complexity of this transformation, the method employs simple conditions and is operationally straightforward to perform.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruptenes &#8211; A Family of Terpene Analogs Give Insight into Cyclisation Mechanisms by Cascade Disruption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The terpenoid substrate analogs (7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydrogeranylgeranyl diphosphate (6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GGPP) and (7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydrogeranylfarnesyl diphosphate (6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP) were synthesised from (S)&#8208;citronellol and enzymatically converted with nine diterpene and two sesterterpene synthases, respectively. In two cases the substrate analogs were converted into diterpenes in cyclisation reactions corresponding to those observed for the native substrate GGPP, while the cyclisation cascade was disrupted or redirected in the other nine cases, leading to products that were named ruptenes. Several of the isolated ruptenes represent deprotonation products of cationic intermediates that are analogs of the intermediates proposed along the cyclisation cascades for the native substrates GGPP or GFPP, thus giving insights into the complex reaction mechanisms of terpene synthase mediated biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of Bulk Li2S as Cathode Material for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries through Organochalcogenide&#8208;Based Redox Mediation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium sulfide (Li2S) is considered as a promising cathode material for sulfur&#8208;based batteries. However, its activation remains to be one of the key challenges against its commercialization. The extraction of Li+ from bulk Li2S has a high activation energy (Ea) barrier, which is fundamentally responsible for the initial large overpotential. Herein, a systematic investigation of accelerated bulk Li2S oxidation reaction kinetics was studied by using organochalcogenide&#8208;based redox mediators, in which phenyl ditelluride (PDTe) can significantly reduce the Ea of Li2S and lower the initial charge potential. Simultaneously, it can alleviate the polysulfides shuttling effect by covalently anchoring the soluble polysulfides and converting them into insoluble lithium phenyl tellusulfides (PhTe&#8208;SxLi, x &gt; 1). This alters the redox pathway and accelerates the reaction kinetics of Li2S cathode. Consequently, the Li||Li2S&#8208;PDTe cell shows excellent rate capability and enhanced cycling stability. The Si||Li2S&#8208;PDTe full cell delivers a considerable capacity of 953.5 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 C.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone motif is a widely encountered unit in many natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, a practical and efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones from readily available allylic boronates and benzaldehyde derivatives was developed with chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/AlIII complex as the catalyst. The key success of this transformation was the kinetic resolution of allylboration intermediate via asymmetric lactonization. This protocol enabled to assemble all of four stereoisomers from the same set of starting materials upon variable lactonization. Taking advantage of the current method as the key step, catalytic asymmetric total synthesis of eupomatilones 2, 5, and 6 was accomplished. Control experiments were carried out to probe into the tandem reaction as well as the origin of stereoselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Multi&#8208;step Sulfur Redox Reactions in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Enabled by Dual Defects in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are recognized as the main obstacles to the practical applications of the lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. Accelerated conversion by catalysis can mitigate these issues, leading to enhanced Li&#8208;S performance. However, a catalyst with single active site cannot simultaneously accelerate multiple LiPSs conversion. Herein, we developed a novel dual&#8208;defect (missing linker and missing cluster defects) metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) as a new type of catalyst to achieve synergistic catalysis for the multi&#8208;step conversion reaction of LiPSs. Electrochemical tests and first&#8208;principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that different defects can realize targeted acceleration of stepwise reaction kinetics for LiPSs. Specifically, the missing linker defects can selectively accelerate the conversion of S8 &#8594; Li2S4, while the missing cluster defects can catalyze the reaction of Li2S4 &#8594; Li2S, so as to effectively inhibit the shuttle effect. Hence, the Li&#8208;S battery with an electrolyte to sulfur (E/S) ratio of 8.9 mL g&#8208;1 delivers a capacity of 1087 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 C after 100 cycles.&#160;Even at high sulfur loading of 12.9 mg cm&#8208;2 and E/S = 3.9 mL g&#8208;1, an areal capacity of 10.4 mAh cm&#8208;2 for 45 cycles can still be&#160; obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying the Role of Lewis&#8208;base Sites for the Chemistry in Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis&#8208;base sites have been widely applied to regulate the properties of Lewis&#8208;acid sites in electrocatalysts for achieving a drastic technological leap of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs). Whereas, the direct role&#160; of Lewis&#8208;base&#160; for LOBs are still rarely elucidated. Herein, we comprehensively shed light on the pivotal mechanism of Lewis&#8208;base sites in promoting the electrocatalytic reaction processes of LOBs by constructing the metal&#8208;organic framework containing Lewis&#8208;base sites (named as UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the Lewis&#8208;base sites can act as electron donors that boost the activation of O2/Li2O2 during&#160;discharged&#8208;charged process, resulting in the accelerated reaction kinetics of LOBs. More importantly, the in&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared spectra and DFT calculations firstly demonstrate the Lewis&#8208;base sites can convert Li2O2 growth mechanism from surface&#8208;adsorption growth to solvation&#8208;mediated growth due to the capture of Li+ by Lewis&#8208;base sites upon discharged process, which weakens the adsorption energy of UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 towards LiO2. As a proof of concept, LOB based on UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 can achieve a high discharge specific capacity (12661 mAh g&#8208;1), low discharged&#8208;charged overpotential (0.87 V) and long cycling life (169 cycles). This work reveals the direct role of Lewis&#8208;base sites, which can guide the design of electrocatalysts featuring Lewis&#8208;acid/base dual centers for&#160;LOBs.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Fluorogenic RNA Nanozipper Enables Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Single Viral mRNA Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a genetically encoded RNA nanozipper that allows real&#8208;time imaging of the mobility and dynamic translation of individual viral mRNAs by in situ self&#8208;assembly in live cells, providing information on the spatial dynamics and translation elongation rates of viral mRNAs. This can provide an effective method to monitor the translation activity of individual viral mRNAs in live cells.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time visualization of individual viral mRNA translation activities in live cells is essential to obtain critical details of viral mRNA dynamics and to detect its transient responses to environmental stress. Fluorogenic RNA aptamers are powerful tools for real&#8208;time imaging of mRNA in live cells, but monitoring the translation activity of individual mRNAs remains a challenge due to their intrinsic photophysical properties. Here, we develop a genetically encoded turn&#8208;on 3,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI)&#8208;binding RNA nanozipper with superior brightness and high photostability by in situ self&#8208;assembly of multiple nanozippers along single mRNAs. The nanozipper enables real&#8208;time imaging of the mobility and dynamic translation of individual viral mRNAs in live cells, providing information on the spatial dynamics and translational elongation rate of viral mRNAs.

         <title>Engineering a Self&#8208;Grown TiO2/Ti&#8208;MOF Heterojunction with Selectively Anchored High&#8208;Density Pt Single&#8208;Atomic Cocatalysts for Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>

         <dc:description>
A Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC&#8208;Pt with selectively anchored high&#8208;density Pt single&#8208;atomic cocatalysts is synthesized by leveraging the chelating functionality of ligands and finely controlled surface reconstruction of Ti&#8208;BPDC. The high activity is confirmed due to the efficient charge separation promoted by the heterojunction and the selective location of Pt single&#8208;atomic cocatalysts on the electron&#8208;enriched domain of the heterojunction.







Abstract
A photocatalyst TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC&#8208;Pt is developed with a self&#8208;grown TiO2/Ti&#8208;metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) heterojunction, i.e., TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC, and selectively anchored high&#8208;density Pt single&#8208;atomic cocatalysts on Ti&#8208;BPDC for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This intimate heterojunction, growing from the surface pyrolytic reconstruction of Ti&#8208;BPDC, works in a direct Z&#8208;scheme, efficiently separating electrons and holes. Pt is selectively anchored on Ti&#8208;BPDC by ligands and is found in the form of single atoms with loading up to 1.8&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The selective location of Pt is the electron&#8208;enriched domain of the heterojunction, which further enhances the utilization of the separated electrons. This tailored TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC&#8208;Pt shows a significantly enhanced activity of 12.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 compared to other TiO2&#8208; or MOF&#8208;based catalysts. The structure&#8208;activity relationship further proves the balance of two simultaneously exposed domains of heterojunctions is critical to fulfilling this kind of catalyst.

         <title>Tuning the Crystal Phase to Form MnGaOx&#8208;Spinel for Highly Efficient Syngas to Light Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MnGaOx exhibits a strongly crystal&#8208;phase&#8208;dependent activity. The syngas to light olefins activity is significantly enhanced by forming a spinel crystal phase (MnGaOx&#8208;Spinel) when compared to the activity over a solid solution oxide (MnGaOx&#8208;SS) within the catalyst concept of metal oxide&#8208;zeolite (OXZEO). Key: Hexagonal close&#8208;packed (HCP), Face&#8208;centered cubic (FCC).







Abstract
The oxide&#8211;zeolite (OXZEO) catalyst design concept has been demonstrated in an increasing number of studies as an alternative avenue for direct syngas conversion to light olefins. We report that face&#8208;centered cubic (FCC) MnGaOx&#8208;Spinel gives 40&#8201;% CO conversion, 81&#8201;% light olefins selectivity, and a 0.17&#8197;g&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 space&#8208;time yield of light olefins in combination with SAPO&#8208;18. In comparison, solid solution MnGaOx (characterized by Mn&#8208;doped hexagonal close&#8208;packed (HCP) Ga2O3) with a similar chemical composition gives a much inferior activity, i.e., the specific surface activity is one order of magnitude lower than the spinel oxide. Photoluminescence (PL), in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the superior activity of MnGaOx&#8208;Spinel can be attributed to its higher reducibility (higher concentration of oxygen vacancies) and the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, which facilitates the dissociation of the C&#8722;O bond via a more efficient ketene&#8211;acetate pathway to light olefins.

&lt;/sub&gt;-Spinel gives 40&#8201;% CO conversion, 81&#8201;% light olefins selectivity, and a 0.17&#8197;g&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; space-time yield of light olefins in combination with SAPO-18. In comparison, solid solution MnGaO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (characterized by Mn-doped hexagonal close-packed (HCP) Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with a similar chemical composition gives a much inferior activity, i.e., the specific surface activity is one order of magnitude lower than the spinel oxide. Photoluminescence (PL), in situ Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the superior activity of MnGaO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;-Spinel can be attributed to its higher reducibility (higher concentration of oxygen vacancies) and the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Ga&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; sites, which facilitates the dissociation of the C&#8722;O bond via a more efficient ketene&#8211;acetate pathway to light olefins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Universal Molten Salt Method for Direct Upcycling of Spent Ni&#8208;rich Cathode towards Single&#8208;crystalline Li&#8208;rich Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct upcycling of a spent Ni&#8208;rich cathode (LiNi0.88Co0.095Al0.025O2, NCA) to a single&#8208;crystalline and Li&#8208;rich cathode is achieved for Li&#8208;ion batteries in a binary LiOH&#8208;Na2SO4 system. The regenerated NCA exhibits a remarkable electrochemical performance in terms of long&#8208;term cyclability, high rate performance and low polarization. This strategy can be extended to other cathode materials e.g., LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) and mixed spent NCAs with varied Li compositions.







Abstract
With ever&#8208;increasing pursuit for high&#8208;value output in recycling spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), traditional recycling methods of cathodes tend to be obsolete because of the complicated procedures. Herein, we first upcycle spent polycrystal LiNi0.88Co0.095Al0.025O2 (S&#8208;NCA) to high value&#8208;added single&#8208;crystalline and Li&#8208;rich cathode materials through a simple but feasible LiOH&#8208;Na2SO4 eutectic molten salt strategy. The in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction technique and a series of paratactic experiments record the evolution process of upcycling and prove that excessive Li occupies the transition metal (TM) layers. Beneficial from the single&#8208;crystalline and Li&#8208;rich nature, the regenerated NCA (R&#8208;NCA) exhibits remarkably enhanced electrochemical performances in terms of long&#8208;term cyclability, high&#8208;rate performance and low polarization. This approach can also be successfully extended to other cathode materials e.g., LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) and mixed spent NCAs with varied degree of Li loss.

         <title>Cascade Synthesis of Benzotriazulene with Three Embedded Azulene Units and Large Stokes Shifts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C3&#8208;symmetrical truxene&#8208;based benzotriazulene derivative with three embedded azulene units was concisely synthesized by means of a cascade [4+3] annulation involving a Suzuki coupling followed by Knoevenagel condensation of a readily available triborylated truxene precursor and 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde. The regioselectively trinitrated product exhibits a large Stokes shift of up to 5100&#8197;cm&#8722;1 along with unique solvatochromic effects in different solvents.







Abstract
We report here the one&#8208;pot synthesis of benzo[1,2&#8208;a&#8201;:&#8201;3,4&#8208;a&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;5,6&#8208;a&#8242;&#8242;]triazulene (BTA), wherein three azulene units are embedded through a tandem reaction comprising two steps, Suzuki coupling and Knoevenagel condensation, between a readily available triborylated truxene precursor and 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde. Its nitration leads to a regioselective trinitrated product, namely, BTA&#8208;NO2. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed that the superstructure of BTA consists of a dimer stacked by two enantiomeric helicene conformers, while that of BTA&#8208;NO2 consists of an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;tetramer stacked from two enantiomeric dimers, that is, four distinct helicene conformers. Both compounds show excellent stability and fluorescence with large Stokes shifts of up to 5100&#8197;cm&#8722;1. In addition, BTA&#8208;NO2 exhibits a unique solvatochromic effect in different solvents and hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;induced emission transfer in different ratios of THF/H2O solutions.

         <title>Near IR Bandgap Semiconducting 2D Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Rhombic Lattice and High Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first rhombic 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) single crystal (named Cu2(OHPTP)) is achieved based on a novel octahydroxyphenanthro[9,10:b]triphenylene ligand. Cu2(OHPTP) is an intrinsic p&#8208;type semiconductor with a band gap of 0.5&#8197;eV and charge carrier mobility as high as &#8776;10.0&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are emerging as a unique class of electronic materials. However, 2D c&#8208;MOFs with band gaps in the Vis&#8208;NIR and high charge carrier mobility are rare. Most of the reported conducting 2D c&#8208;MOFs are metallic (i.e. gapless), which largely limits their use in logic devices. Herein, we design a phenanthrotriphenylene&#8208;based, D2h&#8208;symmetric &#960;&#8208;extended ligand (OHPTP), and synthesize the first rhombic 2D c&#8208;MOF single crystals (Cu2(OHPTP)). The continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) analysis unveils the orthorhombic crystal structure at the atomic level with a unique slipped AA stacking. The Cu2(OHPTP) is a p&#8208;type semiconductor with an indirect band gap of &#8776;0.50&#8197;eV and exhibits high electrical conductivity of 0.10&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and high charge carrier mobility of &#8776;10.0&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Theoretical calculations underline the predominant role of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport in this semiquinone&#8208;based 2D c&#8208;MOF.

The copolymerization of kinetically trapped states of tetraphenylethylene containing glycine (TPE&#8208;G) and/or d&#8208;/l&#8208;alanine moieties not only leads to the formation of supramolecular multi&#8208;blocks copolymers (BCPs; tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;blocks) by chain&#8208;growth process, but also transfers chirality at the seed end.







Abstract
We report the unique synthesis of chiral supramolecular tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;BCPs with controllable chirality using kinetically adjusted seeded supramolecular copolymerization in THF and DMSO (99&#8201;:&#8201;1, v/v). Tetraphenylethylene (d&#8208; and l&#8208;TPE) derivatives bearing d&#8208; and l&#8208;alanine side chains formed thermodynamically favored chiral products via a kinetically trapped in monomeric state with a long lag phase. In contrast, achiral TPE&#8208;G containing glycine moieties did not form a supramolecular polymer owing to the energy barrier in its kinetically trapped state. We show that the copolymerization of the metastable states of TPE&#8208;G not only enables the generation of supramolecular BCPs by the seeded living growth method, but also transfers chirality at the seed ends. This research demonstrates the generation of chiral supramolecular tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;BCPs with B&#8208;A&#8208;B, A&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;A, and C&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;C block patterns accompanying chirality transfer via seeded living polymerization.

         <title>Charge Separation in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Enables Heterogeneous Thiol Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon photoactivation, the fast and efficient charge separation along metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) scaffold facilitates the formation of the thiyl radical, a powerful hydrogen atom transfer catalyst. The corresponding MOF competently catalyzed the borylation, silylation, phosphorylation, and thiolation of organic molecules. This research highlights the versatility and practical application potential of MOF&#8208;based heterogeneous thiyl&#8208;radical catalysis.







Abstract
Photoinduced metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) enabled heterogeneous thiol catalysis has been achieved for the first time. MOF Zr&#8208;TPDCS&#8208;1, consisting of Zr6&#8208;clusters and TPDCS linkers (TPDCS=3,3&#8242;&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetramercapto[1,1&#8242;:4&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate), effectively catalyzed the borylation, silylation, phosphorylation, and thiolation of organic molecules. Upon irradiation, the fast electron transfer from TPDCS to Zr6&#8208;cluster is believed to facilitate the formation of the thiyl radical, a hydrogen atom transfer catalyst, which competently abstracts the hydrogen from borane, silane, phosphine, or thiol for generating the corresponding element radical to engender the chemical transformations. The elaborate control experiments evidenced the generation of thiyl radicals in MOF and illustrated a radical reaction pathway. The gram&#8208;scale reaction worked well, and the product was conveniently separated via centrifugation and vacuum with a turnover number (TON) of &#8776;3880, highlighting the practical application potential of heterogeneous thiyl&#8208;radical catalysis.

         <title>Genetic Fusion of Thermoresponsive Polypeptides with UCST&#8208;type Behavior Mediates 1D Assembly of Coiled&#8208;Coil Bundlemers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computationally designed coiled coil&#8208;forming peptides were functionalized with thermoresponsive resilin&#8208;like polypeptides (RLPs) of various lengths and produced via biosynthetic methods in bacterial expression hosts. Interactions between RLPs upon cooling below their upper critical solution temperature (UCST) resulted in nanofibrillar assembly.







Abstract
Thermoresponsive resilin&#8208;like polypeptides (RLPs) of various lengths were genetically fused to two different computationally designed coiled coil&#8208;forming peptides with distinct thermal stability, to develop new strategies to assemble coiled coil peptides via temperature&#8208;triggered phase separation of the RLP units. Their successful production in bacterial expression hosts was verified via gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) turbidimetry, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements confirmed the stability of the coiled coils and showed that the thermosensitive phase behavior of the RLPs was preserved in the genetically fused hybrid polypeptides. Cryogenic&#8208;transmission electron microscopy and coarse&#8208;grained modeling revealed that functionalizing the coiled coils with thermoresponsive RLPs leads to their thermally triggered noncovalent assembly into nanofibrillar assemblies.

         <title>Measurement of Nanometer Distances in Solution via 13C NMR Spectroscopy&#8212;Shrinking of Macrocycles with Increasing Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>

The use of a molecular spring containing an alkyne chain allows the measurement of distances in macrocycles via 13C NMR spectroscopy and reveals the overlooked phenomenon of the inverse thermoelasticity at the molecular level.







Abstract
For a molecular system, size and shape are of elementary importance for its function and properties. Therefore, the determination of distances within a molecule is essential. However, the commonly used methods are only suitable for distances smaller than 4&#8197;&#197; or larger than 15&#8197;&#197;. Here, we show that by incorporating a molecular spring, we can measure distances in macrocycles in the range of 10&#8197;&#197; using 13C NMR spectroscopy. The accuracy of the method also allows to determine the temperature dependence of the distances. In one case, we find a contraction of the length by almost 10&#8201;% upon heating. This shrinking due to heating can be considered as inverse thermoelasticity at the molecular level and is a previously completely overlooked phenomenon that can be used in the future as a tool to change the length and, thus, the function of a system.

         <title>Layered Monophosphate Tungsten Bronzes [Ba(PO4)2]WmO3m&#8722;3: 2D Metals with Locked Charge&#8208;Density&#8208;Wave Instabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the novel MPTB series, thick insulating spacers lock a trigonal symmetry and disrupt tungsten&#8208;oxide blocks. Contrarily to related bronzes, the 2D metallicity is steady down to 1.8&#8197;K, in absence of a charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave (CDW) instability through Peirls&#8208;like W shifts. However, the 2D Fermi surfaces display the characteristics of hidden nesting, giving an exotic context at the crossover between stable 2D metals and CDW order.







Abstract
Phosphate tungsten and molybenum bronzes represent an outstanding class of materials displaying textbook examples of charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave (CDW) physics among other fundamental properties. Here we report on the existence of a novel structural branch with the general formula [Ba(PO4)2][WmO3m&#8722;3] (m=3, 4 and 5) denominated &#8242;layered monophosphate tungsten bronzes&#8242; (L&#8208;MPTB). It results from thick [Ba(PO4)2]4&#8722; spacer layers disrupting the cationic metal&#8208;oxide 2D units and enforcing an overall trigonal structure. Their symmetries are preserved down to 1.8&#8197;K and the compounds show metallic behaviour with no clear anomaly as a function of temperature. However, their electronic structure displays the characteristic Fermi surface of previous bronzes derived from 5d W states with hidden nesting properties. By analogy with previous bronzes, such a Fermi surface should result into CDW order. Evidence of CDW order was only indirectly observed in the low&#8208;temperature specific heat, giving an exotic context at the crossover between stable 2D metals and CDW order.

         <title>Ionic Nickel Embedded in Ceria with High Specific CO2 Methanation Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;doped CeO2 nanoparticles were synthesized and tested for CO2 hydrogenation to CH4 showing high Ni mass&#8208;specific activity and CH4 selectivity. Operando spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations identified ionic Ni species embedded in ceria as the catalytically active centers. Installation of highly dispersed ionic Ni species in the oxide matrix achieved a heterogeneous catalyst with high performance.







Abstract
CO2 hydrogenation to methane is gaining increasing interest as one of the most promising ways to store intermittent renewable energy in the form of chemical fuels. Ni particles supported on CeO2 represent a highly efficient, stable and inexpensive catalyst for this reaction. Herein, Ni&#8208;doped CeO2 nanoparticles were tested for CO2 methanation showing an extremely high Ni mass&#8208;specific activity and CH4 selectivity. Operando characterization reveals that this performance is tightly associated with ionic &#925;i and Ce3+ surface sites, while formation of metallic Ni does not seem to considerably promote the reaction. Theoretical calculations confirmed the stability of interstitial ionic Ni sites on ceria surfaces and highlighted the role of Ce&#8208;O frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), Ni&#8208;O classical Lewis pair (CLP) and Ni&#8208;Ce pair sites to the activation of H2 and CO2 molecules. To a large extent, the theoretical predictions were validated by in situ spectroscopy under H2 and CO2&#8201;:&#8201;H2 gaseous environments.

         <title>Hypsochromically&#8208;shifted Emission of Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks Generated through Post&#8208;synthetic Ligand Reduction</title>

Post&#8208;synthetic ligand reduction in luminescent MOFs results in the generation of materials that can emit green, white&#8208;blue and deep blue light.







Abstract
Luminescent materials with tunable emission are becoming increasingly desirable as we move towards needing efficient Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) for displays. Key to developing better displays is the advancement of strategies for rationally designing emissive materials that are tunable and efficient. We report a series of emissive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) generated using BUT&#8208;10 (BUT: Beijing University of Technology) that emits green light with &#955;max at 525&#8197;nm. Post&#8208;synthetic reduction of the ketone on the fluorenone ligand in BUT&#8208;10 generates new materials, BUT&#8208;10&#8208;M and BUT&#8208;10&#8208;R. The emission for BUT&#8208;10&#8208;R is hypsochromically&#8208;shifted by 113&#8197;nm. Multivariate BUT&#8208;10&#8208;M structures demonstrate emission with two maxima corresponding to the emission of both fluorenol and fluorenone moieties present in their structures. Our study represents a novel post&#8208;synthetic ligand reduction strategy for producing emissive MOFs with tunable emission ranging from green, white&#8208;blue to deep blue.

         <title>Monitoring the Progression of Early Atherosclerosis Using a Fluorescence Nanoprobe for the Detection and Imaging of Phosphorylation and Glucose Levels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we have developed a metal organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based fluorescence assay to analyze the progression of atherosclerosis by assessing the levels of protein phosphorylation and glucose in blood and tissue. The probe was prepared by post&#8208;modification of the MOF PCN&#8208;224 with I3&#8722;&#8208;RhB associate. Two&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging was used to observe changes in protein phosphorylation and glucose levels in early atherosclerosis mice models.







Abstract
Monitoring the early stage of atherosclerosis (AS) without plaque formation is of great significance. Herein, we developed a metal organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based fluorescence nanoprobe to analyze the progression of AS by assessing the levels of protein phosphorylation and glucose in blood and tissue. The probe was prepared by post&#8208;modification of the MOF with iodine (I3&#8722;)&#8208;rhodamine B (RhB) associate, which realizes the specific recognition of target object through the metal joint ZrIV and I3&#8722;&#8208;RhB, respectively. We investigated different stages of target object changes in the early non&#8208;plaque stage of AS in blood. It was found that the levels of phosphate and glucose in the blood were higher than those of the normal mice. The results of two&#8208;photon images showed that early AS mice had higher levels of protein phosphorylation and glucose than that of the normal mice. The present study provides a suitable fluorescence tool for further revealing the pathogenesis and progression of AS.

         <title>Nano&#8208;Impact Single&#8208;Entity Electrochemistry Enables Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Electrocatalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;impact single&#8208;entity electrochemistry has been shown to be superior to conventional ensemble electrochemistry for studies of plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis. This is due to differences in the relative positions of the Fermi levels of the plasmonic particles and the working electrode between the conventional ensemble and nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry setups.







Abstract
Plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis (PEEC), based on a combination of localized surface plasmon resonance excitation and an electrochemical bias applied to a plasmonic material, can result in improved electrical&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion compared to conventional electrocatalysis. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of nano&#8208;impact single&#8208;entity electrochemistry (SEE) for investigating the intrinsic activity of plasmonic catalysts at the single&#8208;particle level using glucose electrooxidation and oxygen reduction on gold nanoparticles as model reactions. We show that in conventional ensemble measurements, plasmonic effects have minimal impact on photocurrents. We suggest that this is due to the continuous equilibration of the Fermi level (EF) of the deposited gold nanoparticles with the EF of the working electrode, leading to fast neutralization of hot carriers by the measuring circuit. The photocurrents detected in the ensemble measurements are primarily caused by photo&#8208;induced heating of the supporting electrode material. In SEE, the EF of suspended gold nanoparticles is unaffected by the working electrode potential. As a result, plasmonic effects are the dominant source of photocurrents under SEE experimental conditions.

         <title>Photo&#8208;RAFT Polymerization for Hydrogel Synthesis through Barriers and Development of Light&#8208;Regulated Healable Hydrogels under NIR Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This photo&#8208;RAFT process enables the preparation of hydrogels under low&#8208;energy near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light without deoxygenation. Exploiting enhanced penetration of NIR light, photoinduced gelation is effectively performed through barriers.

We report an aqueous and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light mediated photoinduced reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (photo&#8208;RAFT) polymerization system catalyzed by tetrasulfonated zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPcS4&#8722;) in the presence of peroxides. Taking advantage of its fast polymerization rates and high oxygen tolerance, this system is successfully applied for the preparation of hydrogels. Exploiting the enhanced penetration of NIR light, photoinduced gelation is effectively performed through non&#8208;transparent biological barriers. Notably, the RAFT agents embedded in these hydrogel networks can be reactivated on&#8208;demand, enabling the hydrogel healing under NIR light irradiation. In contrast to the minimal healing capability (&lt;15&#8201;%) of hydrogels prepared by free radical polymerization (FRP), RAFT&#8208;mediated networks display more than 80&#8201;% recovery of tensile strength. Although healable polymer networks under UV and blue lights have already been established, this work is the first photochemistry system using NIR light, facilitating photoinduced healing of hydrogels through thick non&#8208;transparent barriers.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework with Multi&#8208;Cationic Molecular Chains for Gate Mechanism Controlled Superionic Conduction in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A COF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) with multi&#8208;cationic molecular chains (MCMCs) was developed for gate&#8208;mechanism controlled ion transport, achieving a high Li+ conductivity of 4.91&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and Li+ transference number of 0.71 simultaneously. The ultra&#8208;light COF&#8208;MCMC SSE enables a solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) with a high specific energy density of up to 403.4&#8197;Wh&#8722;1&#8201;kg&#8722;1 under a low N/P ratio and high cathode loading.







Abstract
Although solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) are high potential in achieving better safety and higher energy density, current solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) cannot fully satisfy the complicated requirements of SSBs. Herein, a covalent organic framework (COF) with multi&#8208;cationic molecular chains (COF&#8208;MCMC) was developed as an efficient SSE. The MCMCs chemically anchored on COF channels were generated by nano&#8208;confined copolymerization of cationic ionic liquid monomers, which can function as Li+ selective gates. The coulombic interaction between MCMCs and anions leads to easier dissociation of Li+ from coordinated states, and thus Li+ transport is accelerated. While the movement of anions is restrained due to the charge interaction, resulting in a high Li+ conductivity of 4.9&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and Li+ transference number of 0.71 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. The SSBs with COF&#8208;MCMC demonstrate an excellent specific energy density of 403.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with high cathode loading and limited Li metal source.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Hydroxyacid Potassium Synergists as an Efficient In Situ Defect Passivator for High Performance Tin&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

The researchers developed a novel in situ passivation of SnO2 with optimized SnO2/perovskite interfacial carrier extraction and transport for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.91&#8201;% and a champion fill factor (FF) up to 0.852 were obtained.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on SnO2 electron transport layers have attracted extensive research due to their compelling photovoltaic performance. Herein, we presented an in situ passivation of SnO2 with low&#8208;cost hydroxyacid potassium synergist during deposition to optimize the interface carrier extraction and transport for high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stabilities of PSCs. The orbital overlap of the carboxyl oxygen with the Sn atom alongwith the homogenous nano&#8208;particle deposition effectively suppresses the interfacial defects and releases the internal residual strains in the perovskite. Accordingly, a PCE of 24.91&#8201;% with a fill factor (FF) up to 0.852 is obtained for in situ passivated devices, which is one of the highest values for SnO2&#8208;based PSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintained 80&#8201;% of its initial PCE at 80&#8201;&#176;C over 600&#8197;h, 100&#8201;% PCE at ambient conditions for 1300&#8197;h, and 98&#8201;% after one week maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under continuous AM1.5G illumination.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Magnesiophilic Coordination Layer Stabilizes Mg Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mg0 atoms are exposed to electrolyte solvents, impurities, and anions, leading to side reactions on the anode surface and further passivation. In this work, aniline with magnesiophilic amine group and high stability to Mg0 forms a benign coordination layer to protect the Mg anode from these side reactions.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) are seriously plagued by the direct exposure of the Mg anode to the electrolyte components, leading to spontaneous and electrochemical side reactions and interfacial passivation. Herein, a benign coordination layer is constructed at the Mg/electrolyte interface where aniline with a strong magnesiophilic amine group and high stability to Mg is chosen as representative, which has higher adsorption energy than DME (1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane) and trace water. This Mg coordination environment mitigates side reactions, forming a non&#8208;passivating interface consisting of aniline and much fewer by&#8208;products after several cycles. Therefore, the Mg symmetrical cell operates with a low overpotential and uniform Mg0 deposition. This interfacial coordination can also be adopted for Mg anode protection in various electrolyte cases of Mg(TFSI)2 electrolyte systems.

         <title>Activatable NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Lipid Nanoparticles for Improved Messenger RNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) lipid nanoparticle containing pH activatable NIR&#8208;II Cy&#8208;lipid was developed for potentiating mRNA translation efficiency through a stimulus&#8208;responsive photothermal&#8208;promoted endosomal escape delivery (SPEED) strategy under 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation.







Abstract
Endosomal escape remains a central issue limiting the high protein expression of mRNA therapeutics. Here, we present second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing pH activatable NIR&#8208;II dye conjugated lipid (Cy&#8208;lipid) for potentiating mRNA delivery efficiency via a stimulus&#8208;responsive photothermal&#8208;promoted endosomal escape delivery (SPEED) strategy. In acidic endosomal microenvironment, Cy&#8208;lipid is protonated and turns on NIR&#8208;II absorption for light&#8208;to&#8208;heat transduction mediated by 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Then, the heat&#8208;promoted LNPs morphology change triggers rapid escape of NIR&#8208;II LNPs from the endosome, allowing about 3&#8208;fold enhancement of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) encoding mRNA translation capacity compared to the NIR&#8208;II light free group. In addition, the bioluminescence intensity induced by delivered luciferase encoding mRNA in the mouse liver region shows positive correlation with incremental radiation dose, indicating the validity of the SPEED strategy.

In acidic endosomal microenvironment, Cy-lipid is protonated and turns on NIR-II absorption for light-to-heat transduction mediated by 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Then, the heat-promoted LNPs morphology change triggers rapid escape of NIR-II LNPs from the endosome, allowing about 3-fold enhancement of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) encoding mRNA translation capacity compared to the NIR-II light free group. In addition, the bioluminescence intensity induced by delivered luciferase encoding mRNA in the mouse liver region shows positive correlation with incremental radiation dose, indicating the validity of the SPEED strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost, High&#8208;Strength Cellulose&#8208;based Quasi&#8208;Solid Polymer Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;strength cellulose&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte was developed with high Li+ conductivity, Li+ transference number (0.85) and excellent interface stability. The delicate design results in an unprecedented 1200 cycles with 97.7&#8201;% capacity retention at 1&#8197;C and 25&#176;C is achieved for the assembled solid&#8208;state batteries, which provides a crucial solution for the industrial production of next&#8208;generation batteries.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries are considered as the next generation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, their solid electrolytes suffer from low ionic conductivity, poor interface performance, and high production costs, restricting their commercial application. Herein, a low&#8208;cost cellulose acetate&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid composite polymer electrolyte (C&#8208;CLA QPE) was developed with a high Li+ transference number (
) of 0.85 and excellent interface stability. The prepared LiFePO4 (LFP)|C&#8208;CLA QPE|Li batteries exhibited excellent cycle performance with a capacity retention of 97.7&#8201;% after 1200 cycles at 1&#8197;C and 25&#8201;&#176;C. The experimental results and Density Function Theory (DFT) simulation revealed that the partially esterified side groups in the CLA matrix contribute to the migration of Li+ and enhance electrochemical stability. This work provides a promising strategy for fabricating cost&#8208;effective, stable polymer electrolytes for solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

Abstract
A concise asymmetric total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;quinocarcin has been accomplished with high step economy from commercially available starting materials. A catalytic enantioselective reductive 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of N&#8208;heteroaryl secondary amides with reactive dipolarophiles using iridium/copper relay catalysis was developed to prepare the key chiral pyrrolidine intermediate with three stereocenters. This protocol features excellent regio&#8208;, exo&#8208; and enantioselectivities, broad substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. The high efficiency was also ensured by a RhIII&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/cyclization and a tandem diastereoselective hydrogenation/cyclization to construct the tetrahydroisoquinoline&#8208;pyrrolidine tetracyclic core unit of quinocarcin.

         <title>Dynamic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Zinc Adeninate Framework (ZAF) for Immobilization of Catalytic DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic dynamic framework, ZAF, can be readily constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of zinc adeninate macrocycles through H&#8208;bonding interactions. ZAF features high biocompatibility, structural flexibility, pH responsivity, and open base pairing sites, where it can load catalytic ssDNA with 96&#8201;% loading efficiency.







Abstract
Effective immobilization and delivery of genetic materials is at the forefront of biological and medical research directed toward tackling scientific challenges such as gene therapy and cancer treatment. Herein we present a biologically inspired hydrogen&#8208;bonded zinc adeninate framework (ZAF) consisting of zinc adeninate macrocycles that self&#8208;assemble into a 3D framework through adenine&#8208;adenine interactions. ZAF can efficiently immobilize DNAzyme with full protection against enzyme degradation and physiological conditions until it is successfully delivered into the nucleus. As compared to zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), ZAFs are twofold more biocompatible with a significant loading efficiency of 96&#8201;%. Overall, our design paves the way for expanding functional hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based systems as potential platforms for the loading and delivery of biologics.

         <title>Formal Insertion of Alkenes Into C(sp3)&#8722;F Bonds Mediated by Fluorine&#8208;Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;F Insertion reactions represent a powerful approach to prepare complex fluorinated compounds, yet they are extremely scarce. Here we report a hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated system that allows for activation of activated alkyl fluorides without sequestering the released fluoride in an unreactive by&#8208;product. This allows for formal insertion of fluorinated styrenes into the C&#8722;F bond affording gem&#8208;difluorinated products.







Abstract
C&#8722;F Insertion reactions represent an attractive approach to prepare valuable fluorinated compounds. The high strength of C&#8722;F bonds and the low reactivity of the fluoride released upon C&#8722;F bond cleavage, however, mean that examples of such processes are extremely scarce in the literature. Here we report a reaction system that overcomes these challenges using hydrogen bond donors that both activate C&#8722;F bonds and allow for downstream reactions with fluoride. In the presence of hexafluoroisopropanol, benzyl and propargyl fluorides undergo efficient formal C&#8722;F bond insertion across &#945;&#8208;fluorinated styrenes. This process, which does not require any additional fluorinating reagent, occurs under mild conditions and delivers products featuring the gem&#8208;difluoro motif, which is attracting increasing interest in medicinal chemistry. Moreover, readily available organic bromides can be engaged directly in a one&#8208;pot process that avoids the isolation of organic fluorides.

         <title>Design of a Bilateral Disulfurating Reagent for Unsymmetrical Polysulfidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilateral disulfurating reagent is designed, allowing diverse functional groups to be bridged via S&#8722;S bonds. With this reagent, diverse electrophiles including inactivated alkyl Cl/Br/I/OMs and benzyl chloride, natural products, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals can be successively cross&#8208;linked with S&#8722;S bonds. Some products of this work showed good antibacterial activities.







Abstract
In this study, we designed a bilateral disulfurating reagent via S&#8722;S motif &#8220;snip and stitch&#8221; processes, allowing diverse functional groups to be bridged via S&#8722;S bonds. The reagent is readily synthesized in high yield using a one&#8208;step reaction from easily available starting materials and is air&#8208;stable. With this reagent, diverse electrophiles including inactivated alkyl Cl/Br/I/OMs and benzyl chloride were sequentially installed on either side of the S&#8722;S motif. Natural products, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals can be successively cross&#8208;linked with S&#8722;S bonds. Notably, the disulfurating reagent can be used in cyclic disulfide synthesis. At last, some desired products of this work showed good antibacterial activities, which could be employed as novel candidates to control plant pathogenic bacteria.

         <title>Dimension Engineering of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive 1D Molecular Crystals into Unusual 2D and 3D Zigzag Waveguides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative technique for the light&#8208;assisted shaping of 1D waveguides to 2D or 3D waveguides in organic crystals is reported. The photoisomerization&#8208;induced crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;amorphous phase transformation results in the mechanical bending of organic crystals on a 2D plane or in 3D free space.







Abstract
We demonstrate an innovative technique to achieve organic 2D and 3D waveguides with peculiar shapes from an acicular, stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular crystal, (2Z,2&#8242;Z)&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;(anthracene&#8208;9,10&#8208;diyl)bis(2&#8208;(3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylacrylonitrile), Ant&#8208;CF3. The greenish&#8208;yellow fluorescent (FL) Ant&#8208;CF3 molecular crystals exhibit laser power&#8208;dependent permanent mechanical bending in 2D and 3D. Investigation of a single&#8208;crystal using spatially&#8208;resolved Raman/FL/electron microscopy, and theoretical calculations revealed photothermal (Z,E)/(E,E) isomerization&#8208;assisted transition from crystalline to amorphous phase at the laser&#8208;exposed regions. This phenomenon facilitates the dimension engineering of a 1D crystal waveguide into 2D waveguide on a substrate or a 3D waveguide in free space. The bends can be used as interconnection points to couple different optical elements. The presented technique has broader implications in organic photonics and other crystal&#8208;related photonic technologies.

         <title>A Quencher&#8208;Based Blood&#8208;Autofluorescence&#8208;Suppression Strategy Enables the Quantification of Trace Analytes in Whole Blood</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we propose a strategy for the suppression of blood autofluorescence to develop an activatable fluorescent probe for reliable quantification of trace analytes in whole blood. As a result of the efficient quenching the blood autofluorescence, this probe achieved the accurate quantification of endogenous H2S in 20&#8208;fold dilutions of whole blood samples, which is the first attempt of quantifying endogenous H2S in whole blood.







Abstract
Precise quantification of trace components in whole blood via fluorescence is of great significance. However, the applicability of current fluorescent probes in whole blood is largely hindered by the strong blood autofluorescence. Here, we proposed a blood autofluorescence&#8208;suppressed sensing strategy to develop an activable fluorescent probe for quantification of trace analyte in whole blood. Based on inner filter effect, by screening fluorophores whose absorption overlapped with the emission of blood, a redshift BODIPY quencher with an absorption wavelength ranging from 600&#8211;700&#8197;nm was selected for its superior quenching efficiency and high brightness. Two 7&#8208;nitrobenzo[c] [1,2,5] oxadiazole ether groups were introduced onto the BODIPY skeleton for quenching its fluorescence and the response of H2S, a gas signal molecule that can hardly be quantified because of its low concentration in whole blood. Such detection system shows a pretty low background signal and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;back ratio, the probe thus achieved the accurate quantification of endogenous H2S in 20&#8208;fold dilution of whole blood samples, which is the first attempt of quantifying endogenous H2S in whole blood. Moreover, this autofluorescence&#8208;suppressed sensing strategy could be expanded to other trace analytes detection in whole blood, which may accelerate the application of fluorescent probes in clinical blood test.

         <title>Sulfenate Anion Catalyzed Diastereoselective Synthesis of Aziridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using sulfenate anion organocatalysts, 33 trans&#8208;aziridines were synthesized with high yields and excellent diastereoselectivity. This method starts with the readily accessible imines and tolerates broad substrate scope. Further functionalization of the synthesized aziridines yielded 12 novel amino&#8208;containing compounds. This work fills a gap in the synthetic and medicinal chemistry literature by providing facile access to trans&#8208;aziridines.







Abstract
Aziridines are highly valued synthetic targets in organic and medicinal chemistry. The organocatalytic synthesis of such structures with broad substrate scope and good diastereoselectivity, however, is rare. Herein, we report a broadly applicable and diastereoselective synthetic method for the synthesis of trans&#8208;aziridines from imines and benzylic or alkyl halides utilizing sulfenate anions (PhSO&#8211;) as the catalyst. Substrates bearing heterocyclic aromatic groups, alkyl, and electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor aryl groups were shown to be compatible with this method (33&#8197;examples), giving good yields and high diastereoselectivities (trans : cis &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1). Further functionalization of aziridines containing cyclopropyl or cyclobutyl groups was achieved through ring&#8208;opening reactions, with a cyclobutyl&#8208;substituted norephedrine derivative obtained through a four&#8208;step synthesis. We offer a mechanistic proposal involving reversible addition of the deprotonated benzyl sulfoxide to the imine to explain the high trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Absorbing B,N&#8208;Heteroarene as Photosensitizer for High&#8208;Performance NIR&#8208;to&#8208;Blue Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first B,N&#8208;heteroarene&#8208;based NIR photosensitizer with multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) characters has been designed and synthesized, which enables heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion with a high upconversion quantum yield (2.9&#8201;%, upper limit 50&#8201;%) and the record&#8208;large anti&#8208;Stokes shift (1.03&#8197;eV).







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizers is highly desirable for a variety of emerging applications. However, the development of NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue TTA&#8208;UC with a large anti&#8208;Stokes shift is extremely challenging because of the energy loss during the intersystem crossing (ISC). Here, we develop the first NIR&#8208;absorbing B,N&#8208;heteroarene&#8208;based sensitizer (BNS) with multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) characters to achieve efficient NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue TTA&#8208;UC. The small energy gap between the singlet and triplet excited states (0.14&#8197;eV) of BNS suppresses the ISC energy loss, and its long&#8208;delayed fluorescence lifetime (115&#8197;&#956;s) contributes to efficient triplet energy transfer. As a result, the largest anti&#8208;Stokes shift (1.03&#8197;eV) among all heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free NIR&#8208;activatable TTA&#8208;UC systems is obtained with a high TTA&#8208;UC quantum yield of 2.9&#8201;% (upper limit 50&#8201;%).

As a result, the largest anti-Stokes shift (1.03&#8197;eV) among all heavy-atom-free NIR-activatable TTA-UC systems is obtained with a high TTA-UC quantum yield of 2.9&#8201;% (upper limit 50&#8201;%).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordinating the Edge Defects of Bismuth with Sulfur for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Bi nanosheets with the edge defect sites coordinated with S via electrochemical reconstruction of Bi19Br3S27 nanowires (BBS), and the edge&#8208;sulfur modulated Bi catalyst demonstrates enhanced formate production and suppressed hydrogen evolution. In an alkaline electrolyte, the edge&#8208;sulfur modulated Bi nanosheets exhibit high current density (&#8776;400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and FE of HCOO&#8722; (&gt;90&#8201;%) and very low FE of H2 (&lt;5&#8201;%) over a wide potential range.







Abstract
Bismuth&#8208;based materials have been recognized as promising catalysts for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR). However, they show poor selectivity due to competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, we have developed an edge defect modulation strategy for Bi by coordinating the edge defects of bismuth (Bi) with sulfur, to promote ECO2RR selectivity and inhibit the competing HER. The prepared catalysts demonstrate excellent product selectivity, with a high HCOO&#8722; Faraday efficiency of &#8776;95&#8201;% and an HCOO&#8722; partial current of &#8776;250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under alkaline electrolytes. Density function theory calculations reveal that sulfur tends to bind to the Bi edge defects, reducing the coordination&#8208;unsaturated Bi sites (*H adsorption sites), and regulating the charge states of neighboring Bi sites to improve *OCHO adsorption. This work deepens our understanding of ECO2RR mechanism on bismuth&#8208;based catalysts, guiding for the design of advanced ECO2RR catalysts.

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Cross&#8208;Coupling of 1&#8208;Azonaphthalenes and 2&#8208;Naphthols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By judicious development of acylimidazolinone as activating group and the use of a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid (CBA) catalyst, the cross&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;azonaphthalenes with 2&#8208;naphthols was realized with high efficiency, exclusive C4&#8208;selectivity and excellent enantioselectivity. The reaction tolerates various functional groups and stereoretentive conversions of products to other binaphthyl compounds were found viable.







Abstract
Atroposelective cross&#8208;coupling is one of the most appealing routes to construct axially chiral binaphthyl molecules due to the modular and succinct nature. Although transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings offer reliable synthetic means, alternative reaction modes that could be applied to broader substrate range without their pre&#8208;functionalization is highly desirable. Herein we show that the application of chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst as organocatalyst could accomplish cross&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;azonaphthalenes and 2&#8208;naphthols with high efficiency, exclusive C4&#8208;selectivity as well as excellent enantioselectivity and functional group compatibility. The identification of acylimidazolinone auxiliary for azo activating group, effective remote catalyst control and arene resonance effect synergistically play key roles in the development of this method. The utility is further demonstrated by transformations of the products into other binaphthyl compounds with perfectly retained axial chirality.

         <title>Elaborating E/Z&#8208;Geometry of Alkenes via Cage&#8208;Confined Arylation Catalysis of Terminal Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light photosensitizing metal&#8208;organic cage was employed as an artificial enzyme&#8208;mimicking nanoreactor for the selective arylation of terminal olefins, giving rise to controllable syntheses of geometrically defined E&#8208; or Z&#8208;alkenes with benzonitrile as the turn on/off key.







Abstract
A visible light photosensitizing metal&#8208;organic cage is applied as an artificial supramolecular reactor to control the reaction of aryl radicals with terminal olefins under green light/solvent conditions, which facilitates selective transformation in the confined enzyme&#8208;mimicking environment to give a series of geometrically defined E/Z&#8208;alkenes. The hydrophobic cage displays good host&#8211;guest inclusion with aromatic substrates, promoting Meerwein arylation and protecting E&#8208;isomeric products during reaction; while a small amount of benzonitrile can turn on efficient E&#8594;Z isomerization. Besides &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, the hydrogen bonding and halogen bonding interactions also act as control forces for the arylation of aliphatic terminal olefins known as poor acceptors in classic Meerwein arylation. The application of this switchable cage&#8208;confined arylation catalysis has been demonstrated by the syntheses of Tapinarof and a marine natural product from the same substrate via controllable E/Z selectivity.

         <title>Synthesis of Sequence&#8208;specific Poly(ester&#8208;carbonate) Copolymers via Chemoselective Terpolymerization Controlled by the Stoichiometric Ratio of Phosphazene/Triethylborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(ester&#8208;carbonate) copolymers with different compositions, sequential structures, topologies, and PC contents were readily synthesized via chemoselective terpolymerization of CO2, epoxide and anhydride by simply adjusting the molar ratio of C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3/TEB.







Abstract
Chemoselective terpolymerization can produce polymer materials with diverse compositions and sequential structures, and thus have attracted considerable attention in the field of polymer synthesis. However, the intrinsic complexity of three&#8208;component system also brings great chanllenge, in regard to the reactivity and selectivity of different monomers. Herein, we report the terpolymerization of CO2/epoxide/anhydride by a binary organocatalytic C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3/TEB (triethylborane) system. Both the activity and chemoselectivity were highly dependent upon the molar ratio of C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3 to TEB, and sequence&#8208;controlled poly(ester&#8208;carbonate) copolymers were readily synthesized through one&#8208;pot/one&#8208;step methodology by tuning the stoichiometric ratio of phosphazene/TEB. In particular, C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3/TEB with a molar ratio of 1/0.5 exhibited an unprecedentedly high chemoselectivity for ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization (ROAC) of cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and phthalic anhydride (PA) first and then ROAC of CO2/CHO. Thus, well&#8208;defined triblock polycarbonate&#8208;b&#8208;polyester&#8208;b&#8208;polycarbonate copolymers can be produced from the mixture of CO2, CHO and PA using a bifunctional initiator. With C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3/TEB=1/1, tapered copolymers were obtained, while random copolymers with high content of polycarbonate (PC) were synthesized with further increasing the amount of TEB. The mechanism of the unexpected chemoselectivity was further investigated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Driven Iron&#8208;Induced Non&#8208;Oxidative Coupling of Methane to Ethane</title>

A photo&#8208;driven Fe3+ complex is efficient for the photochemical coupling of CH4 to C2H6 with high selectivity. Fe3+ was reduced to Fe2+, and the hydroxyl was oxidized to form a &#8901;OH radical for CH4 activation. Fe2+ can be reused for electrolytic H2 production and converted back to Fe3+, forming an energy&#8208;saving and sustainable system.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;driven CH4 conversion to multi&#8208;carbon products and H2 is attractive but challenging, and the development of efficient catalytic systems is critical. Herein, we construct a solar&#8208;energy&#8208;driven redox cycle for combining CH4 conversion and H2 production using iron ions. A photo&#8208;driven iron&#8208;induced reaction system was developed, which is efficient at selective coupling of CH4 as well as conversion of benzene and cyclohexane under mild conditions. For CH4 conversion, 94&#8201;% C2 selectivity and a C2H6 formation rate of 8.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 is achieved. Mechanistic studies reveal that CH4 coupling is induced by hydroxyl radical, which is generated by photo&#8208;driven intermolecular charge migration of an Fe3+ complex. The delicate coordination structure of the [Fe(H2O)5OH]2+ complex ensures selective C&#8722;H bond activation and C&#8722;C coupling of CH4. The produced Fe2+ can be used to reduce the potential for electrolytic H2 production, and then turns back into Fe3+, forming an energy&#8208;saving and sustainable recyclable system.

         <title>Chlorination&#8208;Mediated &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Enhances the Photodynamic Properties of a NIR&#8208;II Emitting Photosensitizer with Extended Conjugation</title>

NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emitting photosensitizers show promising applications in imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, the PDT efficiency of such photosensitizers with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation lengths still needs improvement. In this work, we demonstrate that the chlorination&#8208;mediated &#960;&#8211;&#960; organizing strategy can facilitate energy/charge transfer, subsequently improving the PDT performance of NIR&#8208;II emitting photosensitizers.







Abstract
NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emitting photosensitizers (PSs) have attracted great research interest due to their promising clinical applications in imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, it is still challenging to realize highly efficient PDT on NIR&#8208;II PSs. In this work, we develop a chlorination&#8208;mediated &#960;&#8211;&#960; organizing strategy to improve the PDT of a PS with conjugation&#8208;extended A&#8208;D&#8208;A architecture. The significant dipole moment of the carbon&#8208;chlorine bond and the strong intermolecular interactions of chlorine atoms bring on compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in the chlorine&#8208;substituted PS, which facilitates energy/charge transfer and promotes the photochemical reactions of PDT. Consequently, the resultant NIR&#8208;II emitting PS exhibits a leading PDT performance with a yield of reactive oxygen species higher than that of previously reported long&#8208;wavelength PSs. These findings will enlighten the future design of NIR&#8208;II emitting PSs with enhanced PDT efficiency.

         <title>1D Choline&#8208;PbI3&#8208;Based Heterostructure Boosts Efficiency and Stability of CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>

ChPbI3 was obtained by ChI treatment of the CsPbI3 surface to construct a 1D/3D heterostructure, which significantly improves the defect&#8208;assisted recombination and stability of CsPbI3. Benefiting from 1D/3D heterostructure, the assembled carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) delivered a champion/certified efficiency of 18.05&#8201;%/17.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Defects in perovskite are key factors in limiting the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Generally, choline halide (ChX) can effectively passivate defects by binding with charged point defects of perovskite. However, we verified that ChI can react with CsPbI3 to form a novel crystal phase of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) ChPbI3, which constructs 1D/3D heterostructure with 3D CsPbI3, passivating the defects of CsPbI3 more effectively and then resulting in significantly improved photoluminescence lifetime from 20.2&#8197;ns to 49.4&#8197;ns. Moreover, the outstanding chemical inertness of 1D ChPbI3 and the repair of undesired &#948;&#8208;CsPbI3 deficiency during its formation process can significantly enhance the stability of CsPbI3 film. Benefiting from 1D/3D heterostructure, CsPbI3 carbon&#8208;based PSCs (C&#8208;PSCs) delivered a champion efficiency of 18.05&#8201;% and a new certified record of 17.8&#8201;% in hole transport material (HTM)&#8208;free inorganic C&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Functional DNA Superstructures Exhibit Positive Homotropic Allostery in Ligand Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional DNA superstructures made of concatemeric aptamers display strongly cooperative binding to both small molecules and proteins, without loss of binding affinities of their parent aptamers, thus allowing for the design of a highly responsive sensing system responding over a narrow target range.







Abstract
Inspired by intrinsically disordered proteins in nature, DNA aptamers can be engineered to display strongly homotropic allosteric (or cooperative) ligand binding, representing a unique feature that could be of great utility in applications such as biosensing, imaging and drug delivery. The use of an intrinsic disorder mechanism, however, comes with an inherent drawback of significantly reduced overall binding affinity. We hypothesize that it could be addressed via the design of multivalent supramolecular aptamers. We built functional DNA superstructures (denoted as 3D DNA), made of long&#8208;chain DNA containing tandem repeating DNA aptamers (or concatemeric aptamers). The 3D DNA systems exhibit highly cooperative binding to both small molecules and proteins, without loss of binding affinities of their parent aptamers. We further produced a highly responsive sensor for fluorescence imaging of glutamate stimulation&#8208;evoked adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release in neurons, as well as force stimulus&#8208;triggered ATP release in astrocytes.

         <title>Phosphorothioated DNA Engineered Liposomes as a General Platform for Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Cell&#8208;Specific Intracellular Delivery and Genome Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;specific and stimuli&#8208;responsive cytosolic protein delivery was achieved through a macromolecular fusion machine composed of protein&#8208;loading liposomes and fusogenic phosphorothioated DNA coatings, which mimic the recognition and stimuli&#8208;responsive conformational changes of viral hemagglutinin. This fusion machine provides a versatile platform for various cell type&#8208;dependent biomacromolecules delivery both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Intracellular protein delivery is highly desirable for protein drug&#8208;based cell therapy. Established technologies suffer from poor cell&#8208;specific cytosolic protein delivery, which hampers the targeting therapy of specific cell populations. A fusogenic liposome system enables cytosolic delivery, but its ability of cell&#8208;specific and controllable delivery is quite limited. Inspired by the kinetics of viral fusion, we designed a phosphorothioated DNA coatings&#8208;modified fusogenic liposome to mimic the function of viral hemagglutinin. The macromolecular fusion machine docks cargo&#8208;loaded liposomes at the membrane of target cells, triggers membrane fusion upon pH or UV light stimuli, and facilitates cytosolic protein delivery. Our results showed efficient cell&#8208;targeted delivery of proteins of various sizes and charges, indicating the phosphorothioated DNA plug&#8208;in unit on liposomes could be a general strategy for spatial&#8208;temporally controllable protein delivery both in vitro and in vivo.

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidation of NO2 on TiO2: Evidence of a New Source of N2O5</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chemical mechanism for the generation of gaseous N2O5 in atmosphere via the photocatalytic oxidation of NO2 on TiO2 is shown, and this new source of N2O5 may have important implications to the near&#8208;ground air quality in urban areas and day time due to the presence of both abundant TiO2&#8208;containing building materials and high NOx concentrations.







Abstract
N2O5 is an important intermediate in the atmospheric nitrogen cycle. Using a flow tube reactor, N2O5 was found to be released from the TiO2 surface during the photocatalytic oxidation of NO2, revealing a previously unreported source of N2O5. The rate of N2O5 release from TiO2 was dependent on the initial NO2 concentration, relative humidity, O2/N2 ratio, and irradiation intensity. Experimental evidence and quantum chemical calculations showed that NO2 can react with the surface hydroxyl groups and the generated electron holes on the TiO2, followed by combining with another NO2 molecule to form N2O5. The latter was physisorbed on TiO2 and had a low adsorption energy of &#8722;0.13&#8197;eV. Box model simulations indicated that the new source of N2O5 released from TiO2 can increase the daytime N2O5 concentration by up to 20&#8201;% in urban areas if abundant TiO2&#8208;containing materials and high NOx concentrations were present. This joint experimental/theoretical study not only demonstrates a new chemical mechanism for N2O5 formation but also has important implications for air quality in urban areas.

         <title>Multimodal Self&#8208;sustainable Autonomous Locomotions of Light&#8208;driven Seifert Ribbon Actuators based on Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;driven liquid crystal elastomer ribbon actuator with multimodal self&#8208;sustainable autonomous locomotion is constructed based on the topology of Seifert surface. The Seifert ribbon actuator can self&#8208;sense the illumination area adjustment, and realize the adaptive switches between self&#8208;sustained oscillatory and rotary motions.







Abstract
Multimodal self&#8208;sustainable autonomous locomotions integrated into one individual system, are high&#8208;level intelligent behavioral characteristics of living organisms and are the scientific hotspot of bionic soft actuators. Here, we report a light&#8208;fueled soft actuator with multimodal self&#8208;sustainable movements based on a Seifert ribbon bounded by a Hopf link. The Seifert ribbon actuator can self&#8208;sense the illumination area adjustment, and the actuation component becomes either a discontinuous strip&#8208;like structure or a continuous toroidal structure, which can realize adaptive switches between self&#8208;sustained oscillatory and rotary motions. The two motion modes are applied to the self&#8208;oscillatory piezoelectric generation and self&#8208;rotational work multiplication of cargo transport, respectively. The unique smartness of Seifert surface topology advances the level of actuation intelligence with broad implications for the adaptability, multifunctionality, and autonomy of soft robots.

         <title>Simultaneous Ring Contraction and Expansion Reaction: Electrosynthesis of Heterocycle&#8208;Fused Fulleroids and Photovoltaic Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemically triggered simultaneous ring contraction and expansion reaction of fullerotetrahydropyridazines with electrophiles in the presence of a trace amount of oxygen affords pyrazoline&#8208;fused fulleroids with unprecedented 1,1,2,6&#8208; or 1,1,4,6&#8208;addition patterns.







Abstract
Simultaneous electrochemical ring contraction and expansion reactions remain unexplored to date. Herein, the reductive electrosynthesis of heterocycle&#8208;fused fulleroids from fullerotetrahydropyridazines and electrophiles in the presence of a trace amount of oxygen has been achieved with concurrent ring contraction and ring expansion. When trifluoroacetic acid and alkyl bromides are employed as electrophiles, heterocycle&#8208;fused fulleroids with a 1,1,2,6&#8208;configuration are regioselectively formed. In contrast, heterocycle&#8208;fused fulleroids with a 1,1,4,6&#8208;configuration are regioselectively produced as two separable stereoisomers if phthaloyl chloride is used as the electrophile. The reaction proceeds through multiple steps of electroreduction, heterocycle ring&#8208;opening, oxygen oxidation, heterocycle contraction, fullerene cage expansion, and nucleophilic addition. The structures of these fulleroids have been determined by spectroscopic data and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. The observed high regioselectivities have been rationalized by theoretical calculations. Representative fulleroids have been applied in organic solar cells as the third component and exhibit good performance.

         <title>Quantifying the Contribution of Hot Electrons in Photothermal Catalysis: A Case Study of Ammonia Synthesis over Carbon&#8208;supported Ru Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The actual reaction temperature of photothermal catalytic ammonia synthesis was determined according to Le Chatelier&#8242;s principle, enabling the contributions of hot&#8208;electron and local heating effects to be quantified separately. Further, we systematically investigated the hot&#8208;electron enhancement mechanism by disentangling the hot&#8208;electron effects from the local heating.







Abstract
Photothermal catalysis is one of the most promising green catalytic technologies, while distinguishing the effects of hot electrons and local heating remains challenging. Herein, we reported that the actual reaction temperature of photothermal ammonia synthesis over carbon&#8208;supported Ru catalyst can be measured based on Le Chatelier&#8242;s principle, enabling the hot&#8208;electron contribution to be quantified. By excluding local heating effects, we established that the activation energy via photothermal catalysis was much lower than that of thermocatalysis (54.9 vs. 126.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1), stemming from hot&#8208;electron injection lowering the energy barriers for both N2 dissociation and intermediates hydrogenation. Furthermore, hot&#8208;electron injection acted to suppress carbon support methanation, giving the catalyst outstanding operational stability over 1000&#8197;h. This work provides new insights into the hot&#8208;electron effects in ammonia synthesis, guiding the design of high&#8208;performance photothermal catalysts.

By excluding local heating effects, we established that the activation energy via photothermal catalysis was much lower than that of thermocatalysis (54.9 vs. 126.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), stemming from hot-electron injection lowering the energy barriers for both N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation and intermediates hydrogenation. Furthermore, hot-electron injection acted to suppress carbon support methanation, giving the catalyst outstanding operational stability over 1000&#8197;h. This work provides new insights into the hot-electron effects in ammonia synthesis, guiding the design of high-performance photothermal catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Tunable Enantioconvergence and Kinetic Resolution in the Coupling of Tertiary Cyclobutenols with Arylboroxines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable transformation including an enantioconvergent or a kinetic resolution step was used in the reaction of tertiary cyclobutenols with arylboroxines under a Ni/modified SPINOL catalytic system. This reaction allows the direct use of free hydroxyl groups as leaving groups while the strained ring remains untouched and provides enantioenriched cyclobutenes having a tertiary hydroxyl or an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter.







Abstract
We report that a nickel catalyst system with a modified 1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane&#8208;7,7&#8242;&#8208;diol&#8208;phosphoramidite (SPINOL) as the chiral ligand can enable the coupling of tertiary cyclobutenols and arylboroxines in an enantioconvergent manner, providing cyclobutenes with an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in good yields (up to 84&#8201;% yield) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Moreover, the catalytic system can be applied in the kinetic resolution of cyclobutenols under slightly modified conditions, giving enantioenriched tertiary cyclobutenols with an s factor of up to &gt;200. The reaction uses free hydroxyl groups as the leaving group without additional activation while the strained ring remains untouched. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the inherent discrepant reactivity of the two enantiomers is the key to the controllable enantioconvergent and kinetic resolution process.

         <title>Reversing Free&#8208;Electron Transfer of MoS2+x Cocatalyst for Optimizing Antibonding&#8208;Orbital Occupancy Enables High Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To create a beneficial transfer direction for cultivating moderate hydrogen&#8208;atom adsorption/desorption on a co&#8208;catalyst, an electron&#8208;reversal strategy is proposed that optimizes the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy. The embedded Au can reverse the free&#8208;electron transfer to MoS2+x to form electron&#8208;rich S(2+&#948;)&#8722;, which causes an increased antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy, thus weakening S&#8722;Hads bonds for photocatalytic H2 evolution.







Abstract
The interaction between a co&#8208;catalyst and photocatalyst usually induces spontaneous free&#8208;electron transfer between them, but the effect and regulation of the transfer direction on the hydrogen&#8208;adsorption energy of the active sites have not received attention. Herein, to steer the free&#8208;electron transfer in a favorable direction for weakening S&#8722;Hads bonds of sulfur&#8208;rich MoS2+x, an electron&#8208;reversal strategy is proposed for the first time. The core&#8211;shell Au@MoS2+x cocatalyst was constructed on TiO2 to optimize the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy. Research results reveal that the embedded Au can reverse the electron transfer to MoS2+x to generate electron&#8208;rich S(2+&#948;)&#8722; active sites, thus increasing the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy of S&#8722;Hads in the Au@MoS2+x cocatalyst. Consequently, the increase in the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy effectively destabilizes the H&#8197;1s&#8208;p antibonding orbital and weakens the S&#8722;Hads bond, realizing the expedited desorption of Hads to rapidly generate a lot of visible H2 bubbles. This work delves deep into the latent effect of the photocatalyst carrier on cocatalytic activity.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Kinetic Boron Conjugate Addition of &#947;&#8208;Substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated &#947;&#8208;Lactams</title>

         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric kinetic boron conjugate addition of &#947;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams followed by oxidation is reported with good results. This strategy provides an efficient access to valuable enantioenriched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams bearing simple &#947;&#8208;alkyl or aryl substituents, which showed inhibitory activities against cisplatin&#8208;sensitive ovarian cancer cells A2780. A new Lewis acid Cu&#8208;catalyzed mechanism was put forward.







Abstract
Chiral &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams bearing simple &#947;&#8208; substituents are found in biologically active molecules and natural products, however, their synthesis still remains difficult. Herein, we report an efficient kinetic resolution (KR) of &#947;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams via a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric boron conjugate addition, which also leads to the efficient synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;stereogenic carbon centers. The KR proceeded smoothly with a wide range of &#947;&#8208;alkyl or aryl substituted substrates including those bearing aromatic heterocycles and different N&#8208;protected substrates in up to 347 of s value. Their highly versatile transformations, synthetic utility in biologically active molecules, and inhibitory activities against cisplatin&#8208;sensitive ovarian cancer cell A2780 have also been demonstrated. Differing from the well&#8208;known mechanism involving Cu&#8722;B species in Cu&#8208;catalyzed boron conjugate additions, our mechanistic studies using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experiments indicate that a Lewis acid CuI&#8208;catalyzed mechanism is the likely pathway in the catalytic reaction.

         <title>Lithium Ferrocyanide Catholyte for High&#8208;Energy and Low&#8208;cost Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries
</title>

         <dc:description>
The designed redox&#8208;active material for aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFB), lithium ferrocyanide (Li4[Fe(CN)6]), exhibits a solubility of 2.32&#8197;M, much higher than Na4[Fe(CN)6] (0.56&#8197;M) and K4[Fe(CN)6] (0.76&#8197;M). It endows the constructed [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;&#8208;based ARFB system with high capacity up to 61.64&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 (pH&#8208;neutral) and 56.28&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 (alkaline) at a concentration of 2.30&#8197;M and 2.10&#8197;M cathode reactant, which is the highest value in all reported aqueous electrolytes.







Abstract
Aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFBs) are a promising technology for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, however, their commercial success relies on redox&#8208;active materials (RAM) with high electron storage capacity and cost competitiveness. Herein, a redox&#8208;active material lithium ferrocyanide (Li4[Fe(CN)6]) is designed. Li+ ions not only greatly boost the solubility of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to 2.32&#8197;M at room temperature due to weak intermolecular interactions, but also improves the electrochemical performance of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;. By coupling with Zn, ZIRFBs were built, and the capacity of the batteries was as high as 61.64&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 (pH&#8208;neutral) and 56.28&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 (alkaline) at a [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; concentration of 2.30&#8197;M and 2.10&#8197;M. These represent unprecedentedly high [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; concentrations and battery energy densities reported to date. Moreover, benefiting from the low cost of Li4[Fe(CN)6], the overall chemical cost of alkaline ZIRFB is as low as $11 per kWh, which is one&#8208;twentieth that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art VFB ($211.54&#8197;per&#8201;kWh). This work breaks through the limitations of traditional electrolyte composition optimization and will strongly promote the development of economical [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;&#8208;based RFBs in the future.

It endows the constructed [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-based ARFB system with high capacity up to 61.64&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (pH-neutral) and 56.28&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (alkaline) at a concentration of 2.30&#8197;M and 2.10&#8197;M cathode reactant, which is the highest value in all reported aqueous electrolytes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFBs) are a promising technology for grid-scale energy storage, however, their commercial success relies on redox-active materials (RAM) with high electron storage capacity and cost competitiveness. Herein, a redox-active material lithium ferrocyanide (Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]) is designed. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions not only greatly boost the solubility of [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to 2.32&#8197;M at room temperature due to weak intermolecular interactions, but also improves the electrochemical performance of [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;/3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. By coupling with Zn, ZIRFBs were built, and the capacity of the batteries was as high as 61.64&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (pH-neutral) and 56.28&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (alkaline) at a [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; concentration of 2.30&#8197;M and 2.10&#8197;M. These represent unprecedentedly high [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations and battery energy densities reported to date. Moreover, benefiting from the low cost of Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;], the overall chemical cost of alkaline ZIRFB is as low as $11 per kWh, which is one-twentieth that of the state-of-the-art VFB ($211.54&#8197;per&#8201;kWh). This work breaks through the limitations of traditional electrolyte composition optimization and will strongly promote the development of economical [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;/3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-based RFBs in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Layered Zeolite for Assembly of Two&#8208;Dimensional Separation Membranes for Hydrogen Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new layered zeolite (ECNU&#8208;28) with interlayer swollen structure is prepared hydrothermally using decamethonium bromide as the organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). Its phase exfoliation is realized under mild conditions, giving high&#8208;quality suspensions containing flat and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. The resulting 2D zeolite membrane prepared by vacuum filtration gives high&#8208;performance sieving of H2 from CO2 or CH4.







Abstract
Membrane separation is an energy&#8208;efficient and environmentally friendly process. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molecular sieving membranes featuring unique nanopores and low transport resistance have the potential to achieve highly permeable and selective mixture separation with low energy consumption. High&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio zeolite nanosheets with intrinsic molecular&#8208;sieving pores perpendicular to the layers are desirable building blocks for fabricating high&#8208;performance 2D zeolite membrane. However, a wider application of 2D zeolitic membranes is restricted by the limited number of recognized zeolite nanosheets. Herein, we report a swollen layered zeolite, ECNU&#8208;28, with SZR topology and eight&#8208;member ring (8&#8208;MR, 3.0&#8197;&#197;&#215;4.8&#8197;&#197;) pores normal to the nanosheets. It can be easily exfoliated to construct 2D membrane, which shows a high hydrogen selectivity up to 130 from natural gas and is promising for hydrogen purification and greenhouse gas capture.

         <title>Tuning Pore Polarization to Boost Ethane/Ethylene Separation Performance in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pore polarity tuning strategy has been realized through the solid&#8208;state transformation of graphene&#8208;sheet&#8208;like hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, which significantly improves the performance of one&#8208;step purification of C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 mixture.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) show great potential in energy&#8208;saving C2H6/C2H4 separation, but there are few examples of one&#8208;step acquisition of C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 because it is still difficult to achieve the reverse&#8208;order adsorption of C2H6 and C2H4. In this work, we boost the C2H6/C2H4 separation performance in two graphene&#8208;sheet&#8208;like HOFs by tuning pore polarization. Upon heating, an in situ solid phase transformation can be observed from HOF&#8208;NBDA(DMA) (DMA=dimethylamine cation) to HOF&#8208;NBDA, accompanied with transformation of the electronegative skeleton into neutral one. As a result, the pore surface of HOF&#8208;NBDA has become nonpolar, which is beneficial to selectively adsorbing C2H6. The difference in the capacities for C2H6 and C2H4 is 23.4&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 for HOF&#8208;NBDA, and the C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratio is 136&#8201;%, which are much higher than those for HOF&#8208;NBDA(DMA) (5.0&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 108&#8201;% respectively). Practical breakthrough experiments demonstrate HOF&#8208;NBDA could produce polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 (1/99, v/v) mixture with a high productivity of 29.2&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K, which is about five times as high as HOF&#8208;NBDA(DMA) (5.4&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1). In addition, in situ breakthrough experiments and theoretical calculations indicate the pore surface of HOF&#8208;NBDA is beneficial to preferentially capture C2H6 and thus boosts selective separation of C2H6/C2H4.

         <title>Arene&#8208;Perfluoroarene Force Driven Sublimation&#8208;Removable Chiral Coassemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthalene&#8208;F8 was introduced to modulate the perylene&#8208;conjugated peptoid self&#8208;assemblies, leading to the emergence of helical nanostructures. Sublimation was initiated in a vacuum oven which efficiently removed Naphthalene&#8208;F8 from coassemblies, which realized a physical protocol to facilitate the versatile fabrication of soft chiral assemblies and chiroptical materials.







Abstract
Multiple constituent coassembly is an emerging strategy to manipulate supramolecular chirality and chiroptical properties such as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). However, the second or third constituent could not be removed from pristine self&#8208;assembly. Here we developed a constitute&#8208;removable chiral coassembly using sublimation that could realize coassembly with tunable supramolecular chirality, luminescence and CPL properties. Octafluoronapthalene (OFN) with small sublimation enthalpy formed coassemblies with perylene&#8208;conjugated peptoids via arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (AP) interaction that induced the emergence of macroscopic chirality and hypsochromic luminescence from yellow to green. Coassembly with OFN accelerated one&#8208;dimensional growth and induced the emergence of macroscopic chirality and CPL. Despite the stability at ambient conditions, vacuum&#8208;treatment triggered fast sublimation of OFN, which behaved as a sacrificial template. Physical removal of OFN retained the helical nanoarchitectures as well as the basic features of Cotton effects and CPL activities. X&#8208;ray diffraction suggested the back&#8208;fill consolidation occurred on the molecular voids by OFN removal that slightly varied the templated molecular arrangements. Sublimation of perfluorinated building units is green and efficient and non&#8208;destructive, which is potentially applicable in constructing template&#8208;directed chiroptical materials and devices.

         <title>Bifunctional Interphase with Target&#8208;Distributed Desolvation Sites and Directionally Depositional Ion Flux for Sustainable Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MOF&#8208;based interphase with target&#8208;distributed desolvation sites and ionic channels is strategically designed for restricting side reactions and zinc dendrites. This layer accurately regulates active water and induces Zn2+ oriented deposition, achieving highly reversible zinc anodes.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) feature high safety and low cost, but intricate anodic side reactions and dendrite growth severely restrict their commercialization. Herein, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) grafted metal organic framework (MOF&#8208;E) is proposed as a dually&#8208;functional anodic interphase for sustainable Zn anode. Specifically, the target&#8208;distributed EDTA serves as an ion&#8208;trapped tentacle to accelerate the desolvation and ionic transport by powerful chemical coordination, while the MOFs offer suitable ionic channels to induce oriented deposition. As a result, MOF&#8208;E interphase fundamentally suppresses side reactions and guides horizontally arranged Zn deposition with (002) preferred orientations. The Zn|MOF&#8208;E@Cu cell exhibits a markedly improved Coulombic efficiency of 99.7&#8201;% over 2500 cycles, and the MOF&#8208;E@Zn|KVOH (KV12O30&#8208;y&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O) cell yields a steady circulation of 5000 cycles@90.47&#8201;% at 8&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

In 2019, IUPAC started the &#8220;Top Ten Emerging Technologies in Chemistry&#8221; initiative. This article reviews the impact of the initiative and how it contributes to different areas, including sustainability, technology transfer, and education.







Abstract
In the past 15&#8197;years, we've experienced an unprecedented series of crises, including financial (2008), health (2020), and most recently the supply chain disruptions and the energy emergency in Europe, caused by the war in Ukraine (2022). On top of that, climate change still poses a serious threat to our lives and our planet. These interconnected challenges create tremendous societal problems and compromise the viability of the chemical industry in an environment of price volatility and high inflation. Thus, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has launched a series of actions to tackle this and raise awareness of the role of chemistry in solving our major threats. Since 2019, IUPAC has identified the &#8220;Top Ten Emerging Technologies in Chemistry&#8221; to connect chemical researchers with industry, bridging the gap between science and innovation, maintaining the current competitiveness of the chemical industry, as well as tackling our most pressing global challenges.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Measurement of Nanometer Distances in Solution via 13C NMR Spectroscopy&#8212;Shrinking of Macrocycles with Increasing Temperature (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 25/2023)</title>

         <dc:description>
The determination of nanometer&#8208;scale distances in solution is an enormous challenge. In their Research Article (e202301465) Gebhard Haberhauer and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that distances in macrocycles can be measured using a molecular spring and 13C&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. The sensitivity of the method even allows the determination of thermoelasticity at the molecular level: One studied system expands at low temperatures and shrinks at high temperatures.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel preparation under NIR light&#160;via a photoinduced RAFT polymerization catalyzed by tetrasulfonated zinc phthalocyanine is reported by Cyrille Boyer et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202302451). Exploiting enhanced penetration of NIR light, photoinduced gelation is effectively performed through barriers. Thiocarbonylthio groups embedded in hydrogel networks facilitate the reactivation of polymer chains under NIR wavelengths, enabling the photoinduced healing of hydrogels through non&#8208;transparent barriers.

         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion battery prepared by low&#8208;cost cellulose acetate exhibits extraordinary electrochemical stability, as reported by Lei Tian, Caizhen Zhu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202302767). The cellulose part in cellulose acetate is like a mountain forest.

The copolymerization of kinetically trapped states of tetraphenylethylene containing glycine (TPE&#8208;G) and/or D&#8208;/L&#8208;alanine moieties leads to the formation of supramolecular multi&#8208;block copolymers, such as B&#8208;A&#8208;B, A&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;A, and C&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;C patterns (BCPs; tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;blocks) by a chain&#8208;growth process. The chirality of the supramolecular BCPs was not only successfully controlled by the chiral seed, but it also transferred to an achiral component during the chain&#8208;growth polymerization, as reported Sung&#8197;Ho Jung, Jong&#8197;Hwa Jung et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202300913).

         <title>Imaging Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Membrane Interactions: Ion&#8208;Channel Pores and Lipid&#8208;Bilayer Permeability in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;association of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) into oligomeric, protofibril, annular and fibril assemblies is intimately linked with neuronal toxicity and Alzheimer's disease. A&#946; can have a range of impacts on the lipid membrane including a carpeting effect and ion&#8208;channel pore formation. Imaging these interactions with the lipid bilayer is providing a clearer picture of A&#946;&#8208;induced membrane permeability, which leads to loss of cellular homeostasis.







Abstract
The accumulation of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptides (A&#946;) is central to the development of Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism by which A&#946; triggers a cascade of events that leads to dementia is a topic of intense investigation. A&#946; self&#8208;associates into a series of complex assemblies with different structural and biophysical properties. It is the interaction of these oligomeric, protofibril and fibrillar assemblies with lipid membranes, or with membrane receptors, that results in membrane permeability and loss of cellular homeostasis, a key event in Alzheimer's disease pathology. A&#946; can have an array of impacts on lipid membranes, reports have included: a carpeting effect; a detergent effect; and A&#946; ion&#8208;channel pore formation. Recent advances imaging these interactions are providing a clearer picture of A&#946; induced membrane disruption. Understanding the relationship between different A&#946; structures and membrane permeability will inform therapeutics targeting A&#946; cytotoxicity.

         <title>Visible&#8208;to&#8208;UV Photon Upconversion: Recent Progress in New Materials and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes recent progress in photon upconversion from visible to ultraviolet light based on triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation. The development of new chromophores, which have achieved high efficiency and low threshold excitation intensity, the material design for film formation, and their application in various photochemical processes are summarized, and the future challenges as an ultraviolet light source are discussed.







Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV, &#955;&lt;400&#8197;nm) light is essential for various photochemical reactions, but its intensity in the solar spectrum is very low, and light sources that artificially generate high&#8208;energy UV light are inefficient and environmentally unfriendly. A solution to this problem is photon upconversion (UC) from visible (vis, &#955;&gt;400&#8197;nm) light to UV light. Among several mechanisms, UC based on triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA&#8208;UC) in particular has made remarkable progress in recent years. The development of new chromophores has enabled highly efficient conversion of low&#8208;intensity visible light into UV light. In this review, we summarize the recent development of visible&#8208;to&#8208;UV TTA&#8208;UC, from the development of chromophores and their production into films to their application in various photochemical processes such as catalysis, bond activation and polymerization. Finally, challenges and opportunities in future material development and applications will be discussed.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Chiral Complexes of Lanthanides and d&#8208;Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini&#8208;review aims to catalogue all accounts of lanthanide and d&#8208;metal chiral complexes which show circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR). Recent improvements in the rational design of suitable complexes which show strong emission properties and high chiroptical activity will be discussed, as well as the setups capable of measuring NIR&#8208;CPL.







Abstract
In recent years, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has witnessed a renaissance, due to the increased popularity of CPL as a spectroscopic technique and greater accessibility to instrumentation. New efficient CPL emitters have been designed and many applications, ranging from electronic devices to microscopy have been proposed. Most examples of CPL are within the visible range, while few cases of near infrared (NIR) CPL active complexes are available. NIR&#8208;CPL compounds may have applications in the telecommunication industry, electronic devices and bioassays. In the following, we shall give an overview of the recent developments allowing for the measurements of NIR&#8208;CPL, and describe the chiroptical properties of metal complexes which achieve this feat.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Extracting Water from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
COFs as emerging crystalline porous materials have shown great potential for water harvesting, as their high porosity and exposed polar sites promote the sorption of water and penetrative pore channels accelerate water diffusions. Various strategies of designing high&#8208;performance COF sorbents in thermodynamics and dynamics are presented by accentuating the critical relationships between structures and water sorption properties.







Abstract
Water scarcity is becoming an increasingly pressing issue due to global population growth and industrialization. One effective approach to addressing this issue is sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH). Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a type of porous crystalline material that have emerged as promising sorbents for water harvesting due to their high surface area, tunable pore size, and customizable pore chemistry. In this mini&#8208;review, we provide an overview of the different types of COFs, their structural characteristics, and the diverse linkage chemistries used to construct them. Then, we summarize recent advances in using COF&#8208;based sorbents for atmospheric water harvesting, including strategies for controlling sorption properties and optimizing performance in terms of thermodynamics and dynamics. Finally, we discuss prospects and challenges associated with improving the efficiency of COF&#8208;based SAWH systems.

         <title>Chasing the Elusive &#8220;In&#8208;Between&#8221; State of the Copper&#8208;Amyloid &#946; Complex by X&#8208;ray Absorption through Partial Thermal Relaxation after Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of X&#8208;ray induced photoreduction and thermal relaxation unravels the structure of an intermediate of the CuII/CuI A&#946;1&#8211;16 redox cycling. The X&#8208;ray beam promotes CuII reduction to CuI at 10&#8197;K, then the sample undergoes partial structural relaxation at 200&#8197;K and a spectrum measured at 10&#8197;K is compatible with a possible &#8220;in&#8208;between&#8221; structure featuring an imidazole ring and a bi&#8208;dentate Asp residue in the Cu coordination site.







Abstract
The redox activity of Cu ions bound to the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide is implicated as a source of oxidative stress in the context of Alzheimer's disease. In order to explain the efficient redox cycling between CuII&#8208;A&#946; (distorted square&#8208;pyramidal) and CuI&#8208;A&#946; (digonal) resting states, the existence of a low&#8208;populated &#8220;in&#8208;between&#8221; state, prone to bind Cu in both oxidation states, has been postulated. Here, we exploited the partial X&#8208;ray induced photoreduction at 10&#8197;K, followed by a thermal relaxation at 200&#8197;K, to trap and characterize by X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) a partially reduced Cu&#8208;A&#946;1&#8211;16 species different from the resting states. Remarkably, the XAS spectrum is well&#8208;fitted by a previously proposed model of the &#8220;in&#8208;between&#8221; state, hence providing the first direct spectroscopic characterization of an intermediate state. The present approach could be used to explore and identify the catalytic intermediates of other relevant metal complexes.

         <title>Tuning the Electronic Properties of Platinum in Hybrid&#8208;Nanoparticle Assemblies for use in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy, we found that the contact of small Pt nanoparticles with large Au or Ag nanoparticles changes the Fermi level of Pt. This change could tune the performance of Pt catalysts in electrocatalytic water splitting.







Abstract
Platinum is the best electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we demonstrate that by contact electrification of Pt nanoparticle satellites on a gold or silver core, the Fermi level of Pt can be tuned. The electronic properties of Pt in such hybrid nanocatalysts were experimentally characterized by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) with the probe molecule 2,6&#8208;dimethyl phenyl isocyanide (2,6&#8208;DMPI). Our experimental findings are corroborated by a hybridization model and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Finally, we demonstrate that tuning of the Fermi level of Pt results in reduced or increased overpotentials in water splitting.

         <title>A Time&#8208;Resolved FRET Assay Identifies a Small Molecule that Inhibits the Essential Bacterial Cell Wall Polymerase FtsW</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
FtsW is a newly discovered peptidoglycan polymerase essential for cell division. We developed a time&#8208;resolved F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TR&#8208;FRET) assay, which we used to screen a Staphylococcus aureus lethal compound library for FtsW inhibitors. We identified a small molecule that inhibits FtsW in vitro. Using a fluorescently labeled, non&#8208;polymerizable Lipid&#8197;II derivative, we showed that this compound displaces Lipid&#8197;II from FtsW.







Abstract
The peptidoglycan cell wall is essential for bacterial survival. To form the cell wall, peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases (PGTs) polymerize Lipid&#8197;II to make glycan strands and then those strands are crosslinked by transpeptidases (TPs). Recently, the SEDS (for shape, elongation, division, and sporulation) proteins were identified as a new class of PGTs. The SEDS protein FtsW, which produces septal peptidoglycan during cell division, is an attractive target for novel antibiotics because it is essential in virtually all bacteria. Here, we developed a time&#8208;resolved F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TR&#8208;FRET) assay to monitor PGT activity and screened a Staphylococcus aureus lethal compound library for FtsW inhibitors. We identified a compound that inhibits S.&#8197;aureus FtsW in vitro. Using a non&#8208;polymerizable Lipid&#8197;II derivative, we showed that this compound competes with Lipid&#8197;II for binding to FtsW. The assays described here will be useful for discovering and characterizing other PGT inhibitors.

         <title>Synthesis of Complex Thiazoline&#8208;Containing Peptides by Cyclodesulfhydration of N&#8208;Thioacyl&#8208;2&#8208;Mercaptoethylamine Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
The spontaneous cyclodesulfhydration of N&#8208;thioacyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercaptoethylamines to thiazolines and its application to the efficient and epimerization&#8208;free synthesis of thiazoline&#8208;containing peptides is described. The novel method features mild reaction conditions and short reaction times while tolerating reactive functional groups, providing rapid access to complex thiazoline&#8208;containing peptides including the natural product mollamide&#8197;F.







Abstract
Herein we report a mild, efficient, and epimerization&#8208;free method for the synthesis of peptide&#8208;derived 2&#8208;thiazolines and 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazines based on a cyclodesulfhydration of N&#8208;thioacyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercaptoethylamine or N&#8208;thioacyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercaptopropylamine derivatives. The described reaction can be easily carried out in aqueous solutions at room temperature and it is triggered by change of the pH, leading to complex thiazoline or dihydrothiazine derivatives without epimerization in excellent to quantitative yields. The new method was applied in the total synthesis of the marine metabolite mollamide&#8197;F, resulting in the revision of its stereochemistry.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric P&#8722;C Coupling of Secondary Phosphine Oxides and Aryl Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intermolecular dynamic kinetic asymmetric P&#8722;C coupling of secondary phosphine oxides and aryl iodides is catalyzed by copper complexes with a carefully tuned diamine ligand. The reaction features a broad substrate scope and affords the corresponding products with high yields and enantioselectivities. Versatile transformations of these products gave diverse P&#8208;chiral scaffolds, which are valuable in asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective P&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling of secondary phosphine oxides (SPOs) is an attractive method for synthesizing P&#8208;stereogenic phosphorus compounds, but the development of such a dynamic kinetic asymmetric process remains a considerable challenge. Here we report an unprecedented highly enantioselective dynamic kinetic intermolecular P&#8722;C coupling of SPOs and aryl iodides catalyzed by copper complexes ligated by a finely modified chiral 1,2&#8208;diamine ligand. The reaction tolerates a wide range of SPOs and aryl iodides, affording P&#8208;stereogenic tertiary phosphine oxides (TPOs) in high yields and with good enantioselectivity (average 89.2&#8201;%&#8201;ee). The resulting enantioenriched TPOs were transformed into structurally diverse P&#8208;chiral scaffolds, which are highly valuable as ligands and catalysts in asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>Dual Photochemical H&#8208;Atom Transfer and Cobalt Catalysis for the Desaturative Synthesis of Phenols from Cyclohexanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic photocatalytic H&#8208;atom transfer and cobalt dual catalysis enables the desaturative synthesis of phenols from cyclohexanone derivatives by formal removal of four H&#8208;atoms.







Abstract
Phenols are integral aromatic molecules widely encountered in the structure of natural products and routinely utilised for the synthesis of high&#8208;value materials. Accessing highly substituted derivatives can often be difficult, especially when their functionalization pattern does not match the intrinsic reactivity leveraged by electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) chemistry. Here, we provide an alternative and mechanistically distinct approach for phenol synthesis using saturated cyclohexanone precursors. This process operates at ambient temperature, under simple purple light irradiation, and features a dual catalytic manifold carrying four sequential H&#8208;atom transfer processes.

         <title>Elucidation of a Dearomatization Route in the Biosynthesis of Oxysporidinone Involving a TenA&#8208;like Cytochrome P450 Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dearomative biosynthetic route from sambutoxin to oxysporidinone in Fusarium oxysporum, in which two enzymes act sequentially and repeatedly on the phenol moiety of the substrate, was elucidated. OsdM, a TenA&#8208;like cytochrome P450 enzyme, oxidizes the phenol ring and forms a [6&#8208;5&#8208;6] ring system. OsdN then catalyzes two successive ene reduction steps, which are followed by another hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by OsdM.







Abstract
Oxidative dearomatization of phenols is an important transformation for synthesis of complex molecules. Oxysporidinone and related 2&#8208;pyridones feature a hydroxy&#8208;substituted cyclohexanone ring, which has been proposed to form by phenol dearomatization, although the details of the biochemical process are still unknown. In this study, we identified the oxysporidinone biosynthetic gene cluster in Fusarium oxysporum by regulator activation and gene knockout studies. Through in vivo and in vitro studies, we confirmed that the phenol dearomatization process involves two enzymes. OsdM, a TenA&#8208;like cytochrome P450 with expected ring&#8208;expansion activity, converts the phenol ring and the 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone core into an unexpected fused [6&#8208;5&#8208;6] ring system. OsdN, on the other hand, catalyzes two successive ene reduction reactions, followed by hydroxylation by OsdM. This new route enriches current knowledge on enzymatic phenol dearomatization and the mechanism of TenA&#8208;like P450s.

         <title>C64 Nanographene Tetraimide&#8212;A Receptor for Phthalocyanines with Subnanomolar Affinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsubstituted phthalocyanines are insoluble and thus challenging to dissolve as monomers in solution. Here a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy is described to solubilize phthalocyanines in organic solvents by complexation with a C64 nanographene tetraimide. A subnanomolar binding affinity of C64 nanographene&#8211;phthalocyanine complex allowed the capture of phthalocyanines into the solution phase.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines are extensively used by the dye and pigment industry and in photovoltaic and photodynamic therapy research due to their intense absorption of visible light, outstanding stability, and versatility. As pigments, the unsubstituted phthalocyanines are insoluble owing to strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking interactions, which causes limitations for the solution chemistry for both free base and metalated phthalocyanines. Here we show a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy to dissolve phthalocyanines into solution. C64 nanographene tetraimide (1) binds two free base/zinc/copper phthalocyanines in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 stoichiometry to solubilize phthalocyanines as evidenced by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis absorption and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Binding studies using a tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted soluble phthalocyanine revealed binding affinities of up to 109&#8197;M&#8722;1 in tetrachloromethane, relating to a Gibbs free energy of &#8722;52&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Energy decomposition analysis revealed that complexes between 1 and phthalocyanines are stabilized by dispersion interactions followed by electrostatics as well as significant charge&#8208;transfer interactions.

C&lt;sub&gt;64&lt;/sub&gt; nanographene tetraimide (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) binds two free base/zinc/copper phthalocyanines in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 stoichiometry to solubilize phthalocyanines as evidenced by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis absorption and single-crystal X-ray analysis. Binding studies using a tetra-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl-substituted soluble phthalocyanine revealed binding affinities of up to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in tetrachloromethane, relating to a Gibbs free energy of &#8722;52&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Energy decomposition analysis revealed that complexes between &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and phthalocyanines are stabilized by dispersion interactions followed by electrostatics as well as significant charge-transfer interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Access to Polysulfides through Photocatalyzed Dithiosulfonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a general photocatalyzed difunctionalization of alkenes, alkynes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and [1.1.1]propellane with dithiosulfonates. The resulting dithiosulfonylated styrene is an excellent nucleophilic disulfuration reagent, which can react with a variety of electrophiles to access unsymmetric disulfides efficiently.







Abstract
In this study, we outline a general method for photocatalyzed difunctionalization of alkenes, a diene, alkynes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and [1.1.1]propellane using dithiosulfonate reagents (ArSO2&#8208;SSR) with improved atom economy. Both &#8220;ArSO2&#8208;&#8221; and &#8220;&#8208;SSR&#8221; on the dithiosulfonate are transferred under mild conditions with broad substrate scope, high stereoselectivity, and complete regioselectivity. Significantly, the resulting dithiosulfonylated styrene is a general and practical nucleophilic disulfuration reagent, reacting with a variety of electrophiles efficiently. Both reactions can be conducted on gram scale, rendering the approach highly valuable.

         <title>Comprehensive Study of the Enhanced Reactivity of Turbo&#8208;Grignard Reagents
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adding LiCl to a Grignard reagent one can easily enhance the reactivity of these widely used organometallic reagents. While numerous examples of this extraordinary reactivity are reported, the reactive species stayed hidden. By using structural elucidation in the solid state and in solution, we were able not only to identify a reactive species but also to prove its mechanistic value by quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
Since its introduction in 2004, Knochel's so called Turbo&#8208;Grignard reagents revolutionized the usage of Grignard reagents. Through the simple addition of LiCl to a magnesium alkyl an outstanding increase in reactivity can be achieved. Though the exact composition of the reactive species remained mysterious, the reactive mixture itself is readily used not only in synthesis but also found its way into more distant fields like material science. To unravel this mystery, we combined single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction with in&#8208;solution NMR&#8208;spectroscopy and closed our investigations with quantum chemical calculations. Using such a variety of methods, we have gained insight into and an explanation for the extraordinary reactivity of this extremely convenient reagent by determining the structure of the first bimetallic reactive species [t&#8208;Bu2Mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;LiCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4&#8201;thf] with two tert&#8208;butyl anions at the magnesium center and incorporated lithium chloride.

         <title>Preserving Macroporosity in Type III Porous Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first macropore&#8208;containing Type III porous liquid (PL) is prepared through a hierarchical filler design strategy. The 4&#8197;&#197; micropores in the hollow metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), function as a perfect size&#8208;exclusion barrier to prevent PDMS from occupying the inner cavities. Thus, it can reversibly host and release up to 27&#8197;wt&#8201;% water which enables its thermal conductivity to be tuned, making it a rare example of liquid thermal switch.







Abstract
Preserving large permanent pore structures in a fluid may endow conventional liquids with emergent physical properties. However, such materials are challenging to make because of the tendency of the pores to be filled and occupied by the solvent molecules. Here, we report the design and synthesis of the first Type III porous liquid (PL) containing uniform yet stable 480&#8197;nm cavities. This was achieved by first constructing a single crystalline hollow metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, through chemical etching. The thin yet defect&#8208;free MOF shell effectively excludes the bulky poly(dimethylsiloxane) solvent molecules from entering the cavity through its 4&#8197;&#197; aperture, resulting in the preservation of both micro&#8208; and macroporosity in the PL. These enormous void spaces allow the PL to reversibly host and release up to 27&#8197;wt&#8201;% water for up to 10&#8197;cycles. The switching between the &#8220;dry&#8221; state and the &#8220;wet&#8221; state led to a large changes of the thermal conductivity of the PL from 0.140 to 0.256&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1, affording a guest&#8208;responsive liquid thermal switch with a switching ratio of 1.8.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Functionalization of Carbazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbazole alkaloids are of great interest to organic and medicinal chemists and material scientists. This unique direct C&#8722;H functionalization has enabled efficient derivatization of commercially available carbazoles in a highly site&#8208;selective manner via a unique six&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate. This reaction boasts good functional group compatibility and displays distinct reactivities based on C3&#8208;substituents of unsymmetrical substrates.







Abstract
Carbazole alkaloids hold great potential in pharmaceutical and material sciences. However, the current approaches for C1 functionalization of carbazoles rely on the use of a pre&#8208;installed directing group, severely limiting their applicability and hindering their overall efficiency. Herein, we report for the first time the development of direct Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation and acylation of carbazoles assisted by norbornene (NBE) as a transient directing mediator. Notably, the involvement of a six&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate was suggested in this case, representing the first example of such intermediacy within the extensively studied Pd/norbornene reactions realm.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Redox Properties of Heteroleptic Molybdenum Complexes through Ligand&#8208;Ligand&#8208;Cooperativity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;ligand cooperativity is introduced as a novel option for fine&#8208;tuning redox properties of molecular complexes. The effect was found when combining dithiolene and 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;3,7&#8208;diphosphacyclooctane ligands in one complex. During electrochemical measurements, a non&#8208;covalent interaction in the second ligand&#8208;sphere results in an electronic conversation between both ligands, which has an unprecedented impact on the observed redox transitions.







Abstract
Heteroleptic molybdenum complexes bearing 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;3,7&#8208;diphosphacyclooctane (P2N2) and non&#8208;innocent dithiolene ligands were synthesized and electrochemically characterized. The reduction potentials of the complexes were found to be fine&#8208;tuned by a synergistic effect identified by DFT calculations as ligand&#8208;ligand cooperativity via non&#8208;covalent interactions. This finding is supported by electrochemical studies combined with UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature&#8208;dependent NMR spectroscopy.

     alt="Fine-Tuning Redox Properties of Heteroleptic Molybdenum Complexes through Ligand-Ligand-Cooperativity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ligand-ligand cooperativity is introduced as a novel option for fine-tuning redox properties of molecular complexes. The effect was found when combining dithiolene and 1,5-diaza-3,7-diphosphacyclooctane ligands in one complex. During electrochemical measurements, a non-covalent interaction in the second ligand-sphere results in an electronic conversation between both ligands, which has an unprecedented impact on the observed redox transitions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heteroleptic molybdenum complexes bearing 1,5-diaza-3,7-diphosphacyclooctane (P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and non-innocent dithiolene ligands were synthesized and electrochemically characterized. The reduction potentials of the complexes were found to be fine-tuned by a synergistic effect identified by DFT calculations as ligand-ligand cooperativity via non-covalent interactions. This finding is supported by electrochemical studies combined with UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-dependent NMR spectroscopy. The observed behavior is reminiscent of enzymatic redox modulation using second ligand sphere effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spectroscopic Signatures of Internal Hydrogen Bonds of Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Acid Sites in the Zeolite H&#8208;MFI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We use chemically accurate quantum mechanical (QM) methods to study the Br&#248;nsted acid site heterogeneity due to aluminum substitution in different crystallographic positions of H&#8208;MFI. We assign free Br&#248;nsted acid sites (blue) to observed OH stretching vibrations and 1H NMR shifts at around 3610&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and 4&#8197;ppm, respectively, and H&#8208;bonded Br&#248;nsted acid sites (orange) to the signals observed at around 3250&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and 7&#8197;ppm, respectively.







Abstract
The location of Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid sites (bridging OH groups, b&#8208;OH) at different crystallographic positions of zeolite catalysts influences their reactivity due to varying confinement. Selecting the most stable b&#8208;OH conformers at each of the 12 T&#8208;sites (T=Si/Al) of H&#8208;MFI, a representative set of 26 conformers is obtained which includes free b&#8208;OH groups pointing into the empty pore space and b&#8208;OH groups forming H&#8208;bonds across five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered rings of TO4 tetrahedra. Chemically accurate coupled&#8208;cluster&#8208;quality calculations for periodic models show that the strength of internal H&#8208;bonds and, hence, the OH bond length vary substantially with the framework position. For 11 of the 19 H&#8208;bonded b&#8208;OH groups examined, our predictions fall into the full width at half maximum range of the experimental signals at 3250&#177;175&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and 7.0&#177;1.4&#8197;ppm which supports previously debated assignments of these signals to H&#8208;bonded b&#8208;OH sites.

Methanol induces a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization of N&#8208;heterocyclic diazoolefins. The products of these formal (3+3) cycloaddition reactions, quinoidal tetrazines, are strong organic reducing agents.







Abstract
The head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization of N&#8208;heterocyclic diazoolefins is described. The products of these formal (3+3) cycloaddition reactions are strongly reducing quinoidal tetrazines. Oxidation of the tetrazines occurs in a stepwise fashion, and we were able to isolate a stable radical cation and diamagnetic dications. The latter are also accessible by oxidative dimerization of diazoolefins.

         <title>Practical Antibody Recruiting by Metabolic Labeling with Caged Glycans</title>

We propose a glycan&#8208;display approach that combines metabolic labeling and a glycan&#8208;caging strategy as a facile method for editing cell&#8208;surface glycans. This method enables the introduction of antigen glycans onto cancer cells to induce immune responses through antibody recruiting in the presence of their antibodies, demonstrating the practical utility of the caging strategy in glycocalyx editing.







Abstract
We propose a de novo glycan display approach that combines metabolic labeling and a glycan&#8208;caging strategy as a facile editing method for cell&#8208;surface glycans. This method enables the introduction of antigen glycans onto cancer cells to induce immune responses through antibody recruiting. The caging strategy prevents the capture of &#945;&#8208;rhamnose (an antigen glycan) by endogenous antibodies during the introduction of the glycan to the targeted cell surface, and subsequent uncaging successfully induces immune responses. Therefore, this study proposes a practical method for editing the cell&#8208;surface glycocalyx under promiscuous conditions, such as those in vivo, which paves the way for the development of glycan function analysis and regulation.

         <title>A Simple, Selective, and General Catalyst for Ring Closing Depolymerization of Polyesters and Polycarbonates for Chemical Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyesters and polycarbonates are depolymerized using the combination of zinc dichloride and polyethylene glycol as a catalyst under reactive distillation conditions carried out at temperatures significantly below the ceiling temperature of the polymers evaluated. Selective polyester depolymerization occurred in the presence of other polymer classes, thereby demonstrating the promise for using the chemistry for the chemical recycling of plastics.







Abstract
The ability to efficiently and selectively process mixed polymer waste is important to address the growing plastic waste problem. Herein, we report that the combination of ZnCl2 and an additive amount of poly(ethylene glycol) under vacuum can readily and selectively depolymerize polyesters and polycarbonates with high ceiling temperatures (Tc&gt;200&#8201;&#176;C) back to their constitute monomers. Mechanistic experiments implicate a random chain scission mechanism and a catalyst structure containing one equivalent of ZnCl2 per ethylene glycol repeat unit in the poly(ethylene glycol). In addition to being general for a wide variety of polyesters and polycarbonates, the catalyst system could selectively depolymerize a polyester in the presence of other commodity plastics, demonstrating how reactive distillation using the ZnCl2/PEG600 catalyst system can be used to separate mixed plastic waste.

&lt;p&gt;Polyesters and polycarbonates are depolymerized using the combination of zinc dichloride and polyethylene glycol as a catalyst under reactive distillation conditions carried out at temperatures significantly below the ceiling temperature of the polymers evaluated. Selective polyester depolymerization occurred in the presence of other polymer classes, thereby demonstrating the promise for using the chemistry for the chemical recycling of plastics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to efficiently and selectively process mixed polymer waste is important to address the growing plastic waste problem. Herein, we report that the combination of ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and an additive amount of poly(ethylene glycol) under vacuum can readily and selectively depolymerize polyesters and polycarbonates with high ceiling temperatures (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;200&#8201;&#176;C) back to their constitute monomers. Mechanistic experiments implicate a random chain scission mechanism and a catalyst structure containing one equivalent of ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per ethylene glycol repeat unit in the poly(ethylene glycol). In addition to being general for a wide variety of polyesters and polycarbonates, the catalyst system could selectively depolymerize a polyester in the presence of other commodity plastics, demonstrating how reactive distillation using the ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/PEG600 catalyst system can be used to separate mixed plastic waste.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Concise Synthesis of Chiral Tricyclic Lactams by Tandem Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Reductive Amination/Lactamization Using Ammonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and economical one&#8208;pot approach to chiral fused tricyclic lactams from readily available ketoesters was developed by using cheap ammonium salts as the nitrogen source through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed tandem dynamic kinetic asymmetric reductive amination/lactamization. This protocol provides highly efficient access to drug intermediates and organocatalysts containing chiral polycyclic N&#8208;heterocycles.







Abstract
The atom&#8208; and step&#8208;efficient synthesis of chiral fused tricyclic lactams from readily available ketoesters using cheap ammonium salts as the nitrogen source is reported. This ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed system operates through an efficient tandem dynamic kinetic asymmetric reductive amination (ARA)/lactamization and produces chiral fused tricyclic lactams in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr and 98&#8201;% yield). The robust method was also applied to the concise synthesis of key intermediates in the synthesis of rivastigmine analogues and chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysts.

         <title>Formal &#947;&#8722;C&#8722;H Functionalization of Cyclobutyl Ketones: Synthesis of cis&#8208;1,3&#8208;Difunctionalized Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential C&#8722;H/C&#8722;C functionalization strategy was reported to effect the otherwise challenging synthesis of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutane building blocks. Numerous aryl, heteroaryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl groups can be installed at the 3&#8208;position of the cyclobutane ring with exclusive cis&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Difunctionalized cyclobutanes are an emerging scaffold in medicinal chemistry that can confer beneficial pharmacological properties to small&#8208;molecule drug candidates. However, the diastereocontrolled synthesis of these compounds typically requires complicated synthetic routes, indicating a need for novel methods. Here, we report a sequential C&#8722;H/C&#8722;C functionalization strategy for the stereospecific synthesis of cis&#8208;&#947;&#8208;functionalized cyclobutyl ketones from readily available cyclobutyl aryl ketones. Specifically, a bicyclo[1.1.1]pentan&#8208;2&#8208;ol intermediate is generated from the parent cyclobutyl ketone via an optimized Norrish&#8208;Yang procedure. This intermediate then undergoes a ligand&#8208;enabled, palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C cleavage/functionalization to produce valuable cis&#8208;&#947;&#8208;(hetero)arylated, alkenylated, and alkynylated cyclobutyl aryl ketones, the benzoyl moiety of which can subsequently be converted to a wide range of functional groups including amides and esters.

         <title>Isolated Electron Trap&#8208;Induced Charge Accumulation for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated Mo atoms in a high oxidation state have been incorporated into the lattice of Cd0.5Zn0.5S (CZS@Mo) nanorods, which exhibit photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 11.32&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Experimental and theoretical simulation results imply that the highly oxidized Mo species lead to mobile&#8208;charge imbalances in CZS and induce the directional photogenerated electrons transfer, resulting in effectively inhibited electron&#8208;hole recombination and greatly enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.







Abstract
The solar&#8208;driven evolution of hydrogen from water using particulate photocatalysts is considered one of the most economical and promising protocols for achieving a stable supply of renewable energy. However, the efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting is far from satisfactory due to the sluggish electron&#8208;hole pair separation kinetics. Herein, isolated Mo atoms in a high oxidation state have been incorporated into the lattice of Cd0.5Zn0.5S (CZS@Mo) nanorods, which exhibit photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 11.32&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (226.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1; catalyst dosage 20&#8197;mg). Experimental and theoretical simulation results imply that the highly oxidized Mo species lead to mobile&#8208;charge imbalances in CZS and induce the directional photogenerated electrons transfer, resulting in effectively inhibited electron&#8208;hole recombination and greatly enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.

         <title>Engineering the Substrate Specificity of a P450 Dimerase Enables the Collective Biosynthesis of Heterodimeric Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Diketopiperazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of heterodimeric tryptophan&#8208;containing diketopiperazines (HTDKPs) is restricted by the limited substrate scopes of the HTDKP&#8208;forming P450 dimerases. Engineering of three important residues (F387, F388, and E73) in NasF5053 significantly expanded its substrate specificity and enabled the collective biosynthesis of at least 93 HTDKPs.







Abstract
Heterodimeric tryptophan&#8208;containing diketopiperazines (HTDKPs) are an important class of bioactive secondary metabolites. Biosynthesis offers a practical opportunity to access their bioactive structural diversity, however, it is restricted by the limited substrate scopes of the HTDKPs&#8208;forming P450 dimerases. Herein, by genome mining and investigation of the sequence&#8208;product relationships, we unveiled three important residues (F387, F388 and E73) in these P450s that are pivotal for selecting different diketopiperazine (DKP) substrates in the upper binding pocket. Engineering these residues in NasF5053 significantly expanded its substrate specificity and enabled the collective biosynthesis, including 12&#8197;self&#8208;dimerized and at least 81 cross&#8208;dimerized HTDKPs. Structural and molecular dynamics analysis of F387G and E73S revealed that they control the substrate specificity via reducing steric hindrance and regulating substrate tunnels, respectively.

         <title>Tailoring Extremely Narrow FWHM in Hypsochromic and Bathochromic Shift of Polycyclo&#8208;Heteraborin MR&#8208;TADF Materials for High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing double boron&#8208;based emitters with extremely narrow band spectrum and high efficiency in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is crucial and challenging. Herein, we report two materials, NO&#8208;DBMR and Cz&#8208;DBMR, based on polycyclic heteraborin skeletons by role&#8208;play of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels. The NO&#8208;DBMR contains an oxygen atom, whereas the Cz&#8208;DBMR has a carbazole core in the double boron&#8208;embedded &#957;&#8208;DABNA structure. The synthesized materials resulted in an unsymmetrical pattern for NO&#8208;DBMR and surprisingly a symmetrical pattern for Cz&#8208;DBMR. Consequently, both materials showed extremely narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 14 nm in hypsochromic (pure blue) and bathochromic (Bluish green) shifted emission without losing their high color fidelity. Furthermore, both materials show high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of over 82%, and an extremely small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#8710;EST) of 0.04 eV, resulting in high&#160;kRISC&#160;of 105 s&#8722;1. Due to the efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics, the&#160; OLEDs based on&#160;heteraborins manifested maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 33.7 and 29.8% for NO&#8208;DBMR and Cz&#8208;DBMR, respectively. This is the first work reported with this type of strategy for achieving an extremely narrow FWHM in hypsochromic and bathochromic shifted emissions with a similar molecular skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal Stability and Outgassing Behaviors of High&#8208;nickel Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>LiNiO2&#8208;based high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes are regarded as promising cathode materials for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density automotive lithium batteries. Most of the attention thus far has been paid towards addressing their surface and structural instability issues brought by the increase of Ni content (&gt; 90%) with an aim to enhance the cycle stability. However, the poor safety performance remains an intractable problem for their commercialization in the market, yet it has not received appropriate attention. In this review, we focus on the gas generation and thermal degradation behaviors of high&#8208;Ni cathodes, which are critical factors in determining their overall safety performance. A comprehensive overview of the mechanisms of outgassing and thermal runaway reactions is presented and analyzed from a chemistry perspective. Finally, we discuss the challenges and the insights into developing robust, safe high&#8208;Ni cathodes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydrodifluoromethylation of alkynes with BrCF2H via nickel catalysis is described. This protocol proceeds via a migratory insertion of nickel hydride to alkyne followed by a CF2H&#8208;coupling, enabling straightforward access to diverse branched CF2H&#8208;alkenes with high efficiency and exclusive regioselectivity. The mild condition applies to a wide array of aliphatic and aryl alkynes with good functional group compatibility. Mechanistic&#160;studies are presented to support the proposed pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>A Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Pathologically Activated Assay for Efficient Bioorthogonal Catalytic Selective Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since polyoxometalates (POMs) can undergo reversible multi&#8208;electron redox transformations, they have been used to modulate the electronic environment of metal nanoparticles for catalysis. Besides, POMs possess unique electronic structures and acid&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly ability. These properties inspire us to tackle the drawbacks of the well&#8208;known copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction when applied in biomedical applications, such as low catalytic efficiency and unsatisfactory disease selectivity in living systems. Herein, we construct the molybdenum (Mo)&#8208;based POM nanoclusters doped with Cu (Cu&#8208;POM NCs) as a highly efficient bioorthogonal catalyst, which is responsive to pathologically acid and H2S for selective antibiofilm therapy. Leveraging the merits of POM, the Cu&#8208;POM NCs exhibit biofilm&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assemble behavior, efficient CuAAC reactions&#8208;mediated in situ synthesis of antibacterial molecules, and NIR&#8208;II photothermal effect selectively triggered by H2S in pathogens. It should be noted that the consumption of bacterial H2S at the pathological site by Cu&#8208;POM NCs extremely decreases the number of persister bacteria, which is conducive to the inhibition of bacterial tolerance and elimination of biofilms. Unlocked at pathological sites and endowed with NIR&#8208;II photothermal property, the constructed POM&#8208;based bioorthogonal catalytic platform provides new insights into the design of efficient and selective bioorthogonal catalysts for disease therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic 2&#8208;Iodoethanol Coupling to Produce 1,4&#8208;Butanediol Mediated by TiO2 and a Catalytic Nickel Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic 2&#8208;iodoethanol (IEO) coupling provides 1,4&#8208;butanediol (BDO) of particular interest to produce degradable polyesters. However, the reduction potential of IEO is too negative (&#8722;1.9 vs NHE) to be satisfied by most of the semiconductors, and the kinetics of transferring one electron for IEO coupling is slow. Here we design a Ni&#8208;complex cocatalyst, which works synergistically with TiO2, realizing reductive coupling of IEO powered by photo&#8208;energy. Coordinating by terpyridine stabilizes Ni2+ from being photo&#8208;deposited to TiO2, thereby retaining the steric configuration beneficial for IEO coupling. The Ni&#8208;complex can rapidly extract electrons from TiO2, generating a low&#8208;valent Ni capable of reducing IEO. The photocatalytic IEO coupling thus provides BDO in 72% selectivity. By a stepwise procedure, BDO is obtained with 70% selectivity from ethylene glycol. This work put forward a strategy for the photocatalytic reduction of molecules requiring strong negative potential.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic 2-iodoethanol (IEO) coupling provides 1,4-butanediol (BDO) of particular interest to produce degradable polyesters.

         <title>Anthracene&#8208;Porphyrin Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated nanoribbons attract interest because of their unusual electronic structures and charge&#8208;transport behavior. Here, we report the synthesis of a series of fully edge&#8208;fused porphyrin&#8208;anthracene oligomeric ribbons (dimer and trimer), together with a computational study of the corresponding infinite polymer. The porphyrin dimer and trimer were synthesized in high yield, via oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of singly linked precursors, using 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH). The crystal structure of the dimer shows that the central &#960;&#8208;system is flat, with a slight S&#8208;shaped wave distortion at each porphyrin terminal. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation causes a dramatic red&#8208;shift in the absorption spectra: the absorption maxima of the fused dimer and trimer appear at 1188 nm and 1642 nm, respectively (for the nickel complexes dissolved in toluene). The coordinated metal in the dimer was changed from Ni to Mg, using p&#8208;tolylmagnesium bromide, providing access to free&#8208;base and Zn complexes. These results open a versatile avenue to longer &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanoribbons with integrated metalloporphyrin units.</dc:description>

         <title>Methane Oxidation over Cu2+/[CuOH]+ Pairs and Site&#8208;Specific Kinetics in Copper Mordenite Revealed by Operando Electron Paramagnetic Resonance and UV&#8208;Visible Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;exchanged mordenite (MOR) is a promising material for partial CH4 oxidation. The structural diversity of Cu species within MOR makes it difficult to identify the active Cu sites and to determine their redox and kinetic properties. In this study, the Cu speciation in Cu&#8208;MOR materials with different Cu loadings has been determined using operando electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and operando ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy as well as in situ photoluminescence (PL) and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. A novel pathway for CH4 oxidation involving paired [CuOH]+ and bare Cu2+ species has been identified. The reduction of bare Cu2+ ions facilitated by adjacent [CuOH]+ demonstrates that the frequently reported assumption of redox&#8208;inert Cu2+ centers does not generally apply. The measured site&#8208;specific reaction kinetics show that dimeric Cu species exhibit a faster reaction rate and a higher apparent activation energy than monomeric Cu2+ active sites highlighting their difference in the CH4 oxidation potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemically Mediated Ring Expansion of Indoles and Pyrroles with Chlorodiazirines: Synthetic Methodology and Thermal Hazard Assessment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that arylchlorodiazirines serve as photo&#8208;activated halocarbene precursors for the selective one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of N&#8208;substituted pyrroles and indoles to the corresponding pyridinium and quinolinium salts. Preliminary investigations indicate that the same strategy also enables the conversion of N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles to pyrimidinium salts. The N&#8208;substituent of the substrate plays an essential role in: (1) increasing substrate scope by preventing product degradation, (2) enhancing yields by suppressing co&#8208;product inhibition, and (3) activating the azinium products towards subsequent synthetic manipulations. This latter point is illustrated by subjecting the quinolinium salts to four complementary partial reductions, which provide concise access to ring&#8208;expanded products with different degrees of increased C(sp3) character. Thermal analysis of the diazirines by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) provides detailed insight into their energetic properties, and highlights the safety benefits of photolyzing &#8211; rather than thermolyzing &#8211; these reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Transfer Reductive Catalytic Fractionation of Lignocellulose: High Monomeric Yield with Switchable Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lignin solubilization and in situ hydrogenolysis are crucial for reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) of lignocellulose to aromatic monomers. In this study, we reported a typical hydrogen bond acceptor of choline chloride (ChCl) to tailor the hydrogen&#8208;donating environment of the Ru/C&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen&#8208;transfer RCF of lignocellulose. The ChCl&#8208;tailored hydrogen&#8208;transfer RCF of lignocellulose was conducted under mild temperature and low&#8208;pressure (&lt;1 bar) conditions, which was applicable to other lignocellulosic biomass sources. We obtained an approximate theoretical yield of propylphenol monomer of 59.2 wt% and selectivity of 97.3% using an optimal content of ChCl (10 wt%) in ethylene glycol at 190 &#176;C for 8 h. When the content of ChCl in ethylene glycol was increased to 110 wt%, the selectivity of propylphenol switched toward propylenephenol (yield of 36.2 wt% and selectivity of 87.6%). The findings in this work provide valuable information for transforming lignin from lignocellulose into value&#8208;add products.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Synthesis and Concurrent Immobilization of Imine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks on Electrodes Using an Electrogenerated Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline porous materials with prospective uses in various devices. However, general bulk synthetic methods usually produce COFs as powders that are insoluble in most of the common organic solvents, arising challenges for the subsequent molding and fixing of these materials on substrates.&#160;Here, we report a novel synthetic methodology that utilizes an electrogenerated acid (EGA), which is produced at an electrode surface by electrochemical oxidation of a suitable precursor, acting as an effective Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst for imine bond formation from the corresponding amine and aldehyde monomers. Simultaneously, it provides the corresponding COF film deposited on the electrode surface. The COF structures obtained with this method exhibited high crystallinities and porosities, and the film thickness could be controlled. Furthermore, such process was applied for the synthesis of various imine&#8208;based COFs, including a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) COF structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanisms of Cysteine&#8208;Lysine Covalent Linkage &#8208; The Role of Reactive Oxygen Species and Competition with Disulfide Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, a new naturally occurring covalent linkage was characterised, involving a cysteine and a lysine, bridged through an oxygen atom. The latter was dubbed as the NOS bond, reflecting the individual atoms involved in this uncommon bond which finds little parallel in lab chemistry. It is found to form under oxidising conditions and reversible upon addition of reducing agents. Further studies have identified the bond in crystal structures across a variety of systems and organisms, potentially playing an important role in regulation, cellular defense and replication. Not only that, double NOS bonds have been identified and even found to be competitive in relation to the formation of disulfide bonds. This raises several questions about how this exotic bond comes to be, what are the intermediates involved in its formation and how it competes with other pathways of sulfide oxidation. With this objective in mind, we revisited our first proposed mechanism for the reaction with model electronic structure calculations, adding information about the reactivity with alternative reactive oxygen species and other potential competing products of oxidation. We present a network with more than 30 reactions which provides one of the most encompassing pictures for cysteine oxidation pathways to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Humidity&#8208;Induced Large Electronic Conductivity Change of 107&#160;on a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Highly Sensitive Water Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic conductivity (EC) of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is sensitive to guest molecules with strong oxidation. Water, nearly ubiquitous, is a relatively mild species, however the effect of H2O on the EC of MOFs is rarely reported. Herein, we explored the effect of H2O on EC in representative MOFs, (NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and its derivatives, by experimental and theoretical investigations. Unexpectedly, a large EC increase of 107 on H2SO4@(NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 by H2O was observed. Br&#248;nsted acid&#8211;base pairs formed between the &#8208;NH2 and H2SO4 played an important role in promoting the charge transfer from H2O to MOF and resulted in large change in the EC. Based on H2SO4@(NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, an high&#8208;performance chemiresistive humidity sensing material was developed with the highest sensitivity, broadest detection range and lowest limit of detection amongst all the reported sensing materials. This work not only demonsrate that H2O with a weak oxidation nature could remarkably influence the EC of MOFs, but it also revealed that the post&#8208;modification of the structure of MOFs could enhance the influence of the guest molecule on their EC to design high&#8208;performance sensing materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Twisted TADF Molecules and Their Applications in OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have attracted great potential in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Among thousands of TADF materials, highly twisted TADF emitters has become a hotspot in recent years. Compared with traditional TADF materials, highly twisted TADF emitters tend to show multi&#8208;channel charge transfer characters and form rigid molecular structures. This is advantageous for TADF materials as non&#8208;radiative decay processes can be suppressed to facilitate efficient exciton utilization. Accordingly, OLEDs with excellent device performances have also been reported. In this review, we have summarized the recent progress of highly twisted TADF materials and related devices, and overviewed the molecular design strategies, photophysical studies and the performances of OLED devices. In addition, the challenges and perspectives of highly twisted TADF molecules and relative OLEDs are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Crosslinked F&#8208;rich Polymer to Inhibit Lead Leakage for Sustainable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells have demonstrated commercial viability, but still face the risk of contamination from lead leakage and long&#8208;term stability problems caused by defects. Here, an organic small molecule (octafluoro&#8208;1,6&#8208; hexanediol diacrylate) is introduced into the perovskite film to form a polymer through in&#8208;situ thermal crosslinking, of which the carbonyl group anchors the uncoordinated Pb2+ of perovskite and reduces the leakage of lead, along with the &#8208;CF2&#8208; hydrophobic group protecting the Pb2+ from water invasion. Additionally, the polymer passivates varieties of Pb&#8208;related and I&#8208;related defects through coordination and hydrogen bonding interactions, regulating the crystallization of perovskite film with reduced trap density, releasing lattice strain, and promoting carrier transport and extraction. The optimal efficiencies of polymer&#8208;incorporated devices are 24.76% (0.09 cm2) and 20.66% (14 cm2). More importantly, the storage stability, thermal stability, and operational stability have been significantly improved.</dc:description>

         <title>Vibration&#8208;driven Reduction of CO2&#160;to Acetate with 100% Selectivity by SnS Nanobelt Piezocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting CO2 into high&#8208;value C2 chemicals such as acetate with high selectivity and efficiency is a critical issue in renewable energy storage. Herein, for the first time we present a vibration&#8208;driven piezocatalysis with tin (II) monosulfide (SnS) nanobelts for conversion of CO2 to acetate with 100% selectivity, and the highest production rate (2.21 mM h&#8722;1) compared with reported catalysts. Mechanism analysis reveal that the polarized charges triggered by periodic mechanical vibration promote the adsorption and activation of CO2. The electron transfer can be facilitated due to built&#8208;in electric field, decreased band gap and work function of SnS under stress. Remarkably, reduced distance between active sites leads to charge enrichment on Sn sites, promoting the C&#8208;C coupling, reducing the energy barriers of the rate determining step. It puts forward a bran&#8208;new strategy for converting CO2 into high&#8208;value C2 products with efficient, low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly piezocatalysis utilizing mechanical energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interactions to Boost Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrolysis of Ammonia Borane: Nickel&#8211;Platinum Nanoparticles Supported on Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Titania</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia borane (AB) is a promising material for chemical H2 storage owing to its high H2 density (up to 19.6 wt%). However, the development of an efficient catalyst for driving H2 evolution through AB hydrolysis remains challenging. Therefore, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven strategy for generating H2 through AB hydrolysis was implemented in this study using Ni&#8211;Pt nanoparticles supported on phosphorus&#8208;doped TiO2 (Ni&#8211;Pt/P&#8208;TiO2) as photocatalysts. Through surface engineering, P&#8208;TiO2 was prepared by phytic&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted phosphorization and then employed as an ideal support for immobilizing Ni&#8211;Pt nanoparticles via a facile co&#8208;reduction strategy. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation at 283 K, Ni40Pt60/P&#8208;TiO2 exhibited improved recyclability and a high turnover frequency of 967.8 molH2&#8729;molPt&#8208;1&#8729;min&#8208;1. Characterization experiments and density functional theory calculations indicated that the enhanced performance of Ni40Pt60/P&#8208;TiO2 originated from a combination of the Ni&#8211;Pt alloying effect, the Mott&#8211;Schottky junction at the metal&#8211;semiconductor interface, and strong metal&#8211;support interactions. These findings not only underscore the benefits of utilizing multipronged effects to construct highly active AB&#8208;hydrolyzing catalysts, but also pave a path toward designing high&#8208;performance catalysts by surface engineering to modulate the electronic metal&#8211;support interactions for other visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of cis&#8208;Decalins by Merging the Birch Reduction and Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we show the combination of the Birch reduction of readily available anisole derivatives and the catalytic asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;pyrones can serve as a powerful platform for the diverse synthesis of synthetically important cis&#8208;decalin scaffolds. Enabled by a well&#8208;modified chiral bis(oxazoline) ligand/Cu(II) complex, a wide range of polysubstituted cis&#8208;decalin scaffolds with up to six continuous stereocenters was generated efficiently. The synthetic potential of this method is demonstrated by the concise synthesis of sesquiterpene (+)&#8208;occidentalol and a key intermediate for seven triterpenes. Mechanistic studies suggest the in situ formed 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes are the key intermediates, and efficient kinetic resolution occurs when C2 and/or C3 substituted 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes are utilized as substrates. DFT calculations elucidate the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction proceeds in a stepwise fashion, and reveal the originations of the stereoselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Boron&#8208;Dipyrromethene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Emitters Enable High&#8208;Performance Narrowband Red Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Didoes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Narrowband organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are receiving significant attention and have demonstrated impressive performance in blue and green OLEDs. However, developing high&#8208;performance narrowband red OLEDs remains a highly desired yet challenging task. Herein, we have developed narrowband red fluorescent emitters by utilizing a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) skeleton in combination with a methyl&#8208;shield strategy. These emitters exhibit small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima (FWHM) ranging from 21 nm (0.068 eV) to 25 nm (0.081 eV) and high photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;PL) ranging from 88.5% to 99.0% in toluene solution. Using BODIPY&#8208;based luminescent materials as emitters, high&#8208;performance narrowband red OLEDs have been assembled with external quantum efficiency as high as 18.3% at 623 nm and 21.1% at 604 nm. This work represents, to our knowledge, the first successful case of achieving NTSC pure&#8208;red OLEDs with the Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of [0.67, 0.33] based on conventional fluorescent emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Helicenes Defected by Heteroatoms and Heptagons with Narrow Emissions and Superior Photoluminescence Quantum Yields
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heteroatomic&#8208; and heptagons&#8208; doped multiple helicenes were successfully synthesized and confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, which exhibit distinguished circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and circular dichroism (CD) signals, with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values.







Abstract
The incorporation of heteroatoms and/or heptagons as the defects into helicenes expands the variety of chiroptical materials with novel properties. However, it is still challenging to construct novel boron&#8208;doped heptagon&#8208;containing helicenes with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values. We report an efficient and scalable synthesis of a quadruple helicene 4Cz&#8208;NBN with two nitrogen&#8208;boron&#8208;nitrogen (NBN) units and a double helicene 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 bearing two NBN&#8208;doped heptagons, the latter could be formed via a two&#8208;fold Scholl reaction of the former. The helicenes 4Cz&#8208;NBN and 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 exhibit excellent PLQYs up to 99&#8201;% and 65&#8201;% with narrow FWHM of 24&#8197;nm and 22&#8197;nm, respectively. The emission wavelengths are tunable via stepwise titration experiments of 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 toward fluoride, enabling distinguished circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from green, orange (4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1&#8208;F1) to yellow (trans/cis&#8208;4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1&#8208;F2) with near&#8208;unity PLQYs and broader circular dichroism (CD) ranges. The five structures of the aforementioned four helicenes were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This work provides a novel design strategy for construction of non&#8208;benzenoid multiple helicenes exhibiting narrow emissions with superior PLQYs.

         <title>Extending the &#960;&#8208;Conjugated System in Spiro&#8208;Type Hole Transport Material Enhances the Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel spiro&#8208;type hole transport material (HTM) was developed by extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system (DP). The new HTM features a stabilized HOMO level, a higher glass transition temperature, and improved morphology on the perovskite layer compared to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. When incorporated into an n&#8208;i&#8208;p device, the DP&#8208;based HTM achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 25.24&#8201;% for small&#8208;area devices and 21.86&#8201;% for modules.







Abstract
Hole transport materials (HTMs) are a key component of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The small molecular 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;amine&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, termed &#8220;Spiro&#8221;) is the most successful HTM used in PSCs, but its versatility is imperfect. To improve its performance, we developed a novel spiro&#8208;type HTM (termed &#8220;DP&#8221;) by substituting four anisole units on Spiro with 4&#8208;methoxybiphenyl moieties. By extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of Spiro in this way, the HOMO level of the HTM matches well with the perovskite valence band, enhancing hole mobility and increasing the glass transition temperature. DP&#8208;based PSC achieves high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.24&#8201;% for small&#8208;area (0.06&#8197;cm2) devices and 21.86&#8201;% for modules (designated area of 27.56&#8197;cm2), along with the certified efficiency of 21.78&#8201;% on a designated area of 27.86&#8197;cm2. The encapsulated DP&#8208;based devices maintain 95.1&#8201;% of the initial performance under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 conditions after 2560&#8197;hours and 87&#8201;% at the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 conditions over 600&#8197;hours.

         <title>Tailoring Ion Ordering in Perovskite Oxide for High&#8208;Temperature Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskites exhibit excellent high&#8208;temperature oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities as the anodes of solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). However, the relationship between the ion ordering and OER performances is rarely investigated. Herein, a series of PrBaCo2&#8722;xFexO5+&#948; perovskites with tailored ion orderings are constructed. Physicochemical characterizations and density functional theory calculations confirm that the oxygen bulk migration and surface transport capacities as well as the OER activities are promoted by the A&#8208;site cation ordering, but weakened by the oxygen vacancy ordering. Hence, SOEC with the A&#8208;site&#8208;ordered and oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;disordered PrBaCo2O5+&#948; anode exhibits the highest performance of 3.40 A cm&#8722;2 at 800 &#176;C and 2.0 V. This work sheds light on the critical role of ion orderings in the high&#8208;temperature OER performance and paves a new way for screening novel anode materials of SOECs.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvation Structure with Enhanced Anionic Coordination for Stable Anodes in Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;O2 batteries have garnered much attention due to their high theoretical energy density. However, the irreversible lithium plating/stripping on the anode limits their performance, which has been paid little attention. Herein, a solvation&#8208;regulated strategy for stable lithium anodes in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (G4) based electrolyte is attempted in Li&#8208;O2 batteries. Trifluoroacetate anions (TFA&#8208;) with strong Li+ affinity are incorporated into the lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI)/G4 electrolyte to attenuate the Li+&#8208;G4 interaction and form anion&#8208;dominant solvates. The bisalt electrolyte with 0.5 M LiTFA and 0.5 M LiTFSI mitigates G4 decomposition and induces an inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This contributes to decreased desolvation energy barrier from 58.20 to 46.31 kJ mol&#8208;1, compared with 1.0 M LiTFSI/G4, for facile interfacial Li+ diffusion and high efficiency. It yields extended lifespan of 120 cycles in Li&#8208;O2 battery with a limited Li anode (7 mAh cm&#8208;2). This work gains comprehensive insights into rational electrolyte design for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Variations in Intracellular Organometallic Reaction Frequency Captured by Single&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Studies of organometallic reactions in living cells commonly rely on ensemble&#8208;averaged measurements, which can obscure the detection of reaction dynamics or location&#8208;specific behavior. This information is necessary to guide the design of bioorthogonal catalysts with improved biocompatibility, activity, and selectivity. By leveraging the high spatial and temporal resolution of single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy, we have successfully captured single&#8208;molecule events promoted by Ru complexes inside live A549 human lung cells. By observing individual allylcarbamate cleavage reactions in real&#8208;time, our results revealed that they occur with greater frequency inside the mitochondria than in the non&#8208;mitochondria regions. The estimated turnover frequency of the Ru complexes was at least 3&#8208;fold higher in the former than the latter. These results suggest that organelle specificity is a critical factor to consider in intracellular catalyst design, such as in developing metallodrugs for therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation and Reactivity Study of a Versatile Trifluoromethylthiolating Agent: S&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Trifluoromethanesulfonothioate (TTST)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel, air and thermally stable, yet highly reactive trifluoromethylthiolating reagent, CF3SO2SCF3 (1), was prepared easily in one step from commercially inexpensive CF3SO2Na and Tf2O. 1 is a highly versatile and atom&#8208;efficient reagent that can generate one equivalent of CF3S+, two equivalents of CF3S&#8208;, or a combination of CF3S./CF3. species. Many high&#8208;yielding CF3S reactions of C, O, S, and N&#8208;nucleophiles were achieved, including the simple&#8208;step preparations of many reported CF3S reagents. 1 delivered a hitherto hard&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize ArSOCF3 that was followed by a novel CF3SII&#8208;rearrangement. Through Cu or TDAE/Ph3P combinations, 1 generated two equivalents of CF3S anion species, and the photo&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkenes with 1 provided CF3/CF3S&#8208;containing products in high atom&#8208;efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design and Expedient Synthesis of Heparan Sulfate Mimetics from Natural Aminoglycosides for Structure and Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heparan sulfate (HS) contains variably repeating disaccharide units organized into high and low&#8208;sulfated domains. This rich structural diversity enables HS to interact with many proteins and regulate key signaling pathways. Efforts to understand structure&#8208;function relationships and harness the therapeutic potential of HS are hindered by the inability to synthesize an extensive library of well&#8208;defined HS structures. We herein report a rational and expedient approach to access a library of 27 oligosaccharides from natural aminoglycosides as HS mimetics in 7 &#8211; 12 steps. This strategy significantly reduces the number of steps compared to the traditional synthesis of HS oligosaccharides from monosaccharide building blocks. Combined with computational insights, we identify a new class of four trisaccharide compounds derived from aminoglycoside tobramycin that mimic natural HS and have a strong binding to heparanase but a low affinity for off&#8208;target platelet factor&#8208;4 protein. This work contributes to a better understanding of HS&#8208;protein interactions and provides a useful tool for the development of anti&#8208;heparanase therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimeric Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkenylation of Alkynes with a Versatile Silicon&#8208;Based Directing Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a manganese&#8208;catalyzed, branched&#8208;selective hydroalkenylation of terminal alkynes, under mild conditions through facile installation of a versatile silanol as a removable directing group. With an alkenyl boronic acid as the coupling partner, this reaction produces stereodefined (E,E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes with high regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The protocol features mild reaction conditions such as room temperature and an air atmosphere, while maintaining excellent functional group compatibility. The resulting 1,3&#8208;dienesilanol products serve as versatile building blocks, as the removal of the silanol group allows for the synthesis of both branched terminal 1,3&#8208;dienes for downstream coupling reactions, as well as stereoselective construction of linear (E,E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes and (E,E,E)&#8208; or (E,E,Z)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trienes. In addition, a Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition can smoothly and selectively deliver silicon&#8208;containing pentasubstituted cyclohexene derivatives. Mechanistic investigations, in conjunction &#160;with DFT calculations, suggest a bimetallic synergistic activation model to account for the observed enhanced catalytic efficiency and good regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Histidine&#8208;Rich Peptides Enhance Endosomal Escape for Antibody&#8208;Targeted Intracellular Delivery of Functional Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, the clinical application of protein/peptide therapeutics is mainly limited to the modulation of diseases in extracellular spaces. Intracellular targets are hardly accessed, owing largely to the endosomal&#160;entrapment of internalized proteins/peptides. Here, we report a strategy to design and construct peptides that enable endosome&#8208;to&#8208;cytosol delivery based on an extension of the "histidine switch" principle. By substituting the Arg/Lys residues in cationic cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) with histidine, we obtained peptides with pH&#8208;dependent membrane&#8208;perturbation activity. These peptides that do not penetrate cells randomly (like CPPs) yet do imitate the endosomal escape of CPPs following cellular uptake. Working with one such 16&#8208;residue peptide (hsLMWP) with high endosomal escape capacity, we engineered modular fusion proteins and successively achieved antibody&#8208;targeted delivery of diverse protein cargoes &#8212;including the pro&#8208;apoptotic protein BID (BH3&#8208;interacting domain death agonist) and Cre recombinase &#8212;into the cytosol of multiple cancer cell types. After extensive in vitro testing, an in vivo analysis with xenograft mice ultimately demonstrated that a trastuzumab&#8208;hsLMWP&#8208;BID fusion conferred strong anti&#8208;tumor efficacy without apparent side effects. Notably, our fusion protein features a modular design, allowing flexible applications for any antibody/cargo combination of choice. Therefore, the potential applications extend throughout life science and biomedicine, including gene editing, cancer treatment, immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing Capacity Degradation of Ge Anode Triggered by Interfacial LiH Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Germanium (Ge), as a fast&#8208;charging and high specific capacity (1568 mAh g&#8722;1) alloy anode, is greatly hampered in practical application by poor cyclability. To date, the understanding of cycling performance degradation remains elusive. This study illustrates that, contrary to conventional beliefs, most of the Ge material in failed anodes still retains good integrity and does not undergo severe pulverization. It is revealed that capacity degradation is clearly correlated to the interfacial evolution of lithium hydride (LiH). Tetralithium germanium hydride (Li4Ge2H), as a new species derived from LiH, is identified as the culprit of Ge anode degradation, which is the dominant crystalized component in an ever&#8208;growing and ever&#8208;insulating interphase. The significantly increased thickness of SEI is accompanied by the accumulation of insulating Li4Ge2H upon cycling, which severely retards the charge transport process and ultimately triggers the anode failure. We believe that the comprehensive understanding of the failure mechanism presented in this study is of great significance to promoting the design and development of alloy anode for the next generation of lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>
