         <title>Unprecedented Relaxivity Gap in pH&#8208;Responsive Fe(III)&#8208;Based MRI Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two mononuclear ferric complexes are reported that respond to a pH change with a 27&#8208; and 71&#8208;fold jump, respectively, in their capacity to accelerate the longitudinal relaxation rate of water&#8208;hydrogen nuclei, and this starting from a negligible base value of only 0.06. This unprecedented performance bodes well for tackling the sensitivity issues hampering the development of Molecular MRI. The two chelates also excel in the fully reversible and fatigue&#8208;less nature of this phenomenon. The structural reasons for this performance reside in the macrocyclic nature of the hexa&#8208;dentate ligand, as well as the presence of a single pendant arm displaying a five&#8208;membered lactam or carbamate which show (perturbed) pKa values of 3.5 in the context of this N6&#10234;N5O1 coordination motif.</dc:description>

         <title>Disruption of Zinc Homeostasis by A Novel Platinum(IV)&#8208;Terthiophene Complex for Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc homeostatic medicine is of great potential for cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy, however, there are few reports on anti&#8208;tumor compounds that can trigger Zn2+&#8208;mediated immune responses. In this work, we developed a novel cyclometalated Pt(IV)&#8208;terthiophene complex Pt3, not only inducing DNA damage and cellular metabolism dysregulation, but also disrupting zinc homeostasis as indicated by the abnormal transcriptional level of zinc regulatory proteins, excess accumulation of Zn2+ in cytoplasm, and down&#8208;regulation of metallothioneins (MTs), which further caused redox imbalance. The simultaneous disruption of zinc and redox homeostasis in response to Pt3 treatment activated gasdermin&#8208;D mediated pyroptosis accompanied with cytoskeleton remodeling, thus releasing pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines to promote dendritic cells (DCs) maturation and T cells tumor&#8208;infiltration, eventually eliminating both primary and distant tumors in vivo. As far as we know, this is the first metal complex that can regulate zinc homeostasis to activate anti&#8208;tumor immunity.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Difunctionalization of Sulfur Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient protocols for accessing iodo&#8208;implanted diaryl and aryl(vinyl) sulfides have been developed using iodonium salts as reactive electrophilic arylation and vinylation reagents. The reactions take place under transition metal&#8208;free conditions, employing odorless and convenient sulfur reagents. A wide variety of functional groups are tolerated in the S&#8208;diarylation, leading to the regioselective late&#8208;stage application of several heterocycles and drug molecules under mild reaction conditions. A novel S&#8208;difunctionalization pathway was discovered using vinyliodonium salts, which proceeds under additive&#8208;free reaction conditions and grants excellent stereoselectivity in the synthesis of (aryl)vinyl sulfides. A one&#8208;pot strategy combining transition metal&#8208;free diarylation and subsequent reduction provided facile access to electron&#8208;rich thioanilines and a direct synthesis of a potential drug candidate derivative. The retained iodo group allows a wide array of further synthetic transformations. Mechanistic insights were elucidated by isolating the key intermediate, and the relevant energy profile was substantiated by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Stability Challenges and Opportunities in Acidic Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) has been regarded as a promising technology for renewable hydrogen production. However, acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with long&#8208;term stability imposes a grand challenge in its large&#8208;scale industrialization. In this review, critical factors that may lead to catalyst&#8217;s instability in couple with potential solutions are comprehensively discussed, including mechanical peeling, substrate corrosion, active&#8208;site over&#8208;oxidation/dissolution, reconstruction, oxide crystal structure collapse through the lattice oxygen&#8208;participated reaction pathway, etc. Last but not least, personal prospects are provided in terms of rigorous stability evaluation criteria,&#160;in situ/operando&#160;characterizations, economic feasibility and practical electrolyzer consideration, highlighting the ternary relationship of structure evolution, industrial&#8208;relevant activity and stability to serve as a roadmap towards the ultimate application of&#160;PEMWE.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Catalysis of Polysulfides in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries through Adsorption Competition by Tuning Cationic Geometric Configuration of Dual&#8208;active Sites in Spinel Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fundamentally understanding the structure&#8208;property relationship is critical to design advanced electrocatalysts for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, which remains a formidable challenge. Herein, by manipulating the regulable cations in spinel oxides, their geometrical&#8208;site&#8208;dependent catalytic activity for sulfur redox is investigated. Experimental and theoretical analyses validate that the modulation essence of cooperative catalysis of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is dominated by LiPSs adsorption competition between Co3+ tetrahedral (Td) and Mn3+ octahedral (Oh) sites on Mn3+Oh&#8208;O&#8208;Co3+Td backbones. Specifically, high&#8208;spin Co3+Td with stronger Co&#8208;S covalency anchors LiPSs persistently, while electron delocalized Mn3+Oh with adsorptive orbital (dz2) functions better in catalyzing specialized LiPSs conversion. This work inaugurates a universal strategy for sculpting geometrical configuration to achieve charge, spin, and orbital topological regulation in electrocatalysts for Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Cationic Disordering Induces two Distinct Degradation Pathways in Co&#8208;Free Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are one of the most attractive cathode materials in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries, their degradation mechanisms are still not completely elucidated. Herein, we report a strong dependence of degradation pathways on the long&#8208;range cationic disordering of Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich Li1&#8208;m(Ni0.94Al0.06)1+mO2 (NA). Interestingly, a disordered layered phase with lattice mismatch can be easily formed in the near&#8208;surface region of NA particles with very low cation disorder (NA&#8208;LCD, m &#8804; 0.06) over electrochemical cycling, while the layered structure is basically maintained in the core of particles forming a &#8220;core&#8208;shell&#8221; structure. Such surface reconstruction triggers a rapid capacity decay during the first 100 cycles between 2.7 and 4.3 V at 1 C or 3 C. On the contrary, the local lattice distortions are gradually accumulated throughout the whole NA particles with higher degrees of cation disorder (NA&#8208;HCD, 0.06 &#8804; m &#8804; 0.15) that lead to a slow capacity decay upon cycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenoxazine Polymer&#8208;based p&#8208;type Positive Electrode for Aluminum&#8208;ion Batteries with Ultra&#8208;long Cycle Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) are a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the abundant reserves, low cost, good safety, and high theoretical capacity of Al. However, AIBs with inorganic positive electrodes still suffer from sluggish kinetics and structural collapse upon cycling. Herein, we propose a novel p&#8208;type poly(vinylbenzyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenoxazine) (PVBPX) positive electrode for AIBs. The dual active sites enable PVBPX to deliver a high capacity of 133 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1. More impressively, the expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugated construction, insolubility, and anionic redox chemistry without bond rearrangement of PVBPX for AIBs contribute to an amazing ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 50000 cycles. The charge storage mechanism is that the AlCl4&#8722; ions can reversibly coordinate/dissociate with the N and O sites in PVBPX sequentially, which is evidenced by both experimental and theoretical results. These findings establish a foundation to advance organic AIBs for large&#8208;scale energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insight&#160;into Peptidyl&#8208;Cysteine Oxidation by the Copper&#8208;Dependent Formylglycine&#8208;Generating Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The copper&#8208;dependent formylglycine&#8208;generating enzyme (FGE) catalyzes the oxygen&#8208;dependent oxidation of specific peptidyl&#8208;cysteine residues to formylglycine. Our QM/MM calculations provide a very likely mechanism for this transformation. The reaction starts with dioxygen binding to the tris&#8208;thiolate Cu(I) center to form a triplet Cu(II)&#8208;superoxide complex. The rate&#8208;determining hydrogen atom abstraction involves a triplet&#8208;singlet crossing to form a Cu(II)&#8208;OOH species that couples with the substrate radical, leading to a Cu(I)&#8208;alkylperoxo intermediate. This is accompanied by proton transfer from the hydroperoxide to the S atom of the substrate via a nearby water molecule. The subsequent O&#8208;O bond cleavage is coupled with the C&#8208;S bond breaking that generates the formylglycine and a Cu(II)&#8208;oxyl complex. Moreover, our results suggest that the aldehyde oxygen of the final product originates from O2, which will be useful for future experimental work.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzotrithiophene&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalysts with Controlled&#160;Conjugation of Building Blocks for Charge Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks have recently shown high potential for photocatalytic hydrogen production. However, their structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationship has not been sufficiently explored to identify a research direction for structural design. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of four benzotrithiophene (BTT)based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different conjugations of building units, and their photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. All four BTT&#8208;COFs had slipped parallel stacking patterns with high crystallinity and specific surface areas. The change in the degree of conjugation was found to rationally tune the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Based on the experimental and calculation results, the tunable photocatalytic performance could be mainly attributed to the electron affinity and charge trapping of the electron accepting units. This study provides important insights for designing covalent organic frameworks for efficient photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Twisted Conformation Thiopyrylium Photosensitizers for in vivo Near Infrared&#8208;II Imaging and Rapid Inactivation of Coronavirus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite significant effort, a majority of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers have short excitation wavelengths, thereby hampering their biomedical applications. Here, we present a facile approach for developing efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers. Based on a series of thiopyrylium&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II (1000&#8208;1700 nm) dyads, we found that the star dyad HD with a sterically bulky and electron&#8208;rich moiety exhibited configuration torsion and significantly enhanced intersystem crossing (ISC) compared to the parent dyad. The electron excitation characteristics of HD changed from local excitation (LE) to charge transfer (CT)&#8208;domain, contributing to a ~ 6&#8208;fold reduction in energy gap (&#916;EST), a ~ 10&#8208;fold accelerated ISC process, and a ~ 31.49&#8208;fold elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) quantum yield. The optimized SP@HD&#8208;PEG2K&#160;lung&#8208;targeting dots enabled real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II lung imaging, which precisely guided rapid pulmonary coronavirus inactivation.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Tunability of Charge Transport in 2D Inorganic Molecular Crystals by Pressure Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant tunability of charge transport in two&#8208;dimensional inorganic molecular crystals, from an insulator to a semiconductor, is revealed for the first time through in situ high&#8208;pressure experimental characterizations.







Abstract
The unique intermolecular van der Waals force in emerging two&#8208;dimensional inorganic molecular crystals (2DIMCs) endows them with highly tunable structures and properties upon applying external stimuli. Using high pressure to modulate the intermolecular bonding, here we reveal the highly tunable charge transport behavior in 2DIMCs for the first time, from an insulator to a semiconductor. As pressure increases, 2D &#945;&#8208;Sb2O3 molecular crystal undergoes three isostructural transitions, and the intermolecular bonding enhances gradually, which results in a considerably decreased band gap by 25&#8201;% and a greatly enhanced charge transport. Impressively, the in situ resistivity measurement of the &#945;&#8208;Sb2O3 flake shows a sharp drop by 5 orders of magnitude in 0&#8211;3.2&#8197;GPa. This work sheds new light on the manipulation of charge transport in 2DIMCs and is of great significance for promoting the fundamental understanding and potential applications of 2DIMCs in advanced modern technologies.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Syntheses of Preussomerins: Control of Spiroacetal Stereogenicity by Photochemical Reaction of a Naphthoquinone through 1,6&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical reactions of naphthoquinones triggered by 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer have been developed. This reaction proceeds in stereospecific manner without loss of the stereochemical information of the substrate, enabling the enantioselective total synthesis of preussomerin EGs. The constructed spiroacetal center is the sole stereogenic center in the product, which had been previously impossible to set by exploiting conventional methods.







Abstract
We report the enantioselective total syntheses of preussomerins EG1, EG2, and EG3. The key transformation is a stereospecific photochemical reaction involving 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer to achieve retentive replacement of a C&#8722;H with a C&#8722;O bond, enabling otherwise&#8208;difficult control of the spiroacetal stereogenic center.

         <title>Halide Chemistry in Tin Perovskite Optoelectronics: Bottlenecks and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efforts to boost tin halide perovskite optoelectronics have focused heavily on the instability of SnII, while other inconspicuous chemical processes have remained unexplored. This Minireview highlights the key role of native halide chemistry in the stability, device performance, ecological impact and prospects for visible light emission in this class of materials. Halide management routes towards viable optoelectronics are also proposed.







Abstract
Tin halide perovskites (Sn HaPs) are the top lead&#8208;free choice for perovskite optoelectronics, but the oxidation of perovskite Sn2+ to Sn4+ remains a key challenge. However, the role of inconspicuous chemical processes remains underexplored. Specifically, the halide component in Sn HaPs (typically iodide) has been shown to play a key role in dictating device performance and stability due to its high reactivity. Here we describe the impact of native halide chemistry on Sn HaPs. Specifically, molecular halogen formation in Sn HaPs and its influence on degradation is reviewed, emphasising the benefits of iodide substitution for improving stability. Next, the ecological impact of halide products of Sn HaP degradation and its mitigation are considered. The development of visible Sn HaP emitters via halide tuning is also summarised. Lastly, halide defect management and interfacial engineering for Sn HaP devices are discussed. These insights will inspire efficient and robust Sn HaP optoelectronics.

     alt="Halide Chemistry in Tin Perovskite Optoelectronics: Bottlenecks and Opportunities"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to boost tin halide perovskite optoelectronics have focused heavily on the instability of Sn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;, while other inconspicuous chemical processes have remained unexplored. This Minireview highlights the key role of native halide chemistry in the stability, device performance, ecological impact and prospects for visible light emission in this class of materials. Halide management routes towards viable optoelectronics are also proposed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tin halide perovskites (Sn HaPs) are the top lead-free choice for perovskite optoelectronics, but the oxidation of perovskite Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; remains a key challenge. However, the role of inconspicuous chemical processes remains underexplored. Specifically, the halide component in Sn HaPs (typically iodide) has been shown to play a key role in dictating device performance and stability due to its high reactivity. Here we describe the impact of native halide chemistry on Sn HaPs. Specifically, molecular halogen formation in Sn HaPs and its influence on degradation is reviewed, emphasising the benefits of iodide substitution for improving stability. Next, the ecological impact of halide products of Sn HaP degradation and its mitigation are considered. The development of visible Sn HaP emitters via halide tuning is also summarised. Lastly, halide defect management and interfacial engineering for Sn HaP devices are discussed. These insights will inspire efficient and robust Sn HaP optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

While the number of submissions to the journal continued to increase in 2022, the Editorial Team also implemented a number of changes with support of the GDCh and the journal's advisory bodies. For example, &#8220;Team Profiles&#8221; are author profiles that celebrate joint efforts as the basis of an inclusive research culture. In looking forward, two new members will join the International Advisory Board in 2023.

         <title>A Configurationally Confined Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Two&#8208;Coordinate Cu(I) Complex for Efficient Blue Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from linear two&#8208;coordinate coinage metal complexes is sensitive to the geometric arrangement of the ligands. Herein we realize the tuning of configuration from coplanar to orthogonal gradually by variation of substituents. In a complex with confined twist configuration, its blue emission peaking at 458 nm presents a high &#934;PL of 0.74 and a short &#964;TADF of 1.9 &#956;s, which indicates a fast enough kr,TADF of 3.9&#215;105 s&#8208;1 and a depressed knr of 1.4&#215;105 s&#8208;1. Such outstanding luminescent properties are attributed to the proper overlap of HOMO and LUMO on Cu(I) d orbitals that guarantees not only small &#916;EST but also sufficient transition oscillator strength for fast  [[EQUATION]] . Vacuum&#8208;deposited blue OLEDs with either doped or host&#8208;free emissive layer present external quantum efficiencies over 20% and 10%, respectively, demonstrating the practicality of the configurationally confined strategy for efficient linear Cu(I) TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Ranking Peptide Binders by Affinity with AlphaFold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>AlphaFold has revolutionized structural biology by predicting highly accurate structures of proteins and their complexes with peptides and other proteins. However, for protein&#8211;peptide systems, we are also interested in identifying the highest affinity binder among a set of candidate peptides.&#160; We present a novel competitive binding assay using AlphaFold to predict structures of the receptor in the presence of two peptides. For systems in which the individual structures of the peptides are well predicted, the assay captures the higher affinity binder in the bound state, and the other peptide in the unbound form with statistical significance. We test the application on six protein receptors for which we have experimental binding affinities to several peptides. We find that the assay is best suited for identifying medium to strong peptide binders that adopt stable secondary structures upon binding.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The electrochemical activation of CuInS2/MoS x  for photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2 production was revealed for the first time through in operando Raman spectroscopy. During the activation process, the initial metallic MoS x  phase was transformed to semiconducting MoS x , which facilitates charge carrier transfer between CuInS2 and MoS x . Ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy suggest the existence of MoO3 after the activation process. However, apart from contradicting these results, in operando Raman spectroscopy revealed some of the intermediate steps of the activation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Applications of Trifluoromethanesulfonic Anhydride in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride has been widely used in synthetic organic chemistry, not only for the conversion of various oxygen&#8208;containing compounds to the triflates, but also for the electrophilic activation and further conversion of amides, sulfoxides, andphosphorus oxides. In recent years, the utilization of Tf2O as an activator for nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, nitriles and nitro groups has become a promising tool for the development of new valuable methods with considerable success. In addition, Tf2O has been used as an efficient radical trifluoromethylation and trifluoromethylthiolation reagent due to the contained SO2CF3 fragment, and significant progress has been made in this area. This minireview summarizes the recent progress in the applications of Tf2O in the above two aspects, and aims to illustrate the role and potential application of this reagent in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strong mutual coupling of and even the opposite change in the key parameters, such as the band gap (Eg) and second&#8208;order harmonic generation (SHG), leads to the extreme scarcity in high&#8208;performance IR nonlinear optical (NLO) chalcogenides. Herein, we report 8 new sulfides, Na2Ba[(AgxNa1&#8208;x)2Sn2S7] (1, x = 0; 1 series, x = 0.1&#8211;0.6; Na2Ba[(Li0.58Na0.42)2Sn2S7], 1&#8208;0.6Li); Na2Sr[Cu2Sn2S7] (2); and Na2Ba[Cu2Sn2S7] (3). We use the structural tolerance factor ( [[EQUATION]] ) to connect the chemical composition, crystal structure, and NLO properties. Guided by these correlations, a better balance between Eg and SHG is realized in 1, which exhibits a large Eg of 3.42 eV and excellent NLO properties (SHG: 1.5 &#215; AGS; laser&#8208;induced damage threshold: 12 &#215; AGS), representing the best performance among the known Hg&#8208; or As&#8208;free sulfides to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic Properties of a Biologically Relevant [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;O)2] Diamond Core Motif with a Short Iron&#8208;Iron distance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diiron cofactors in enzymes perform diverse challenging transformations. The structures of high valent intermediates (Q in methane monooxygenase and X in ribonucleotide reductase) are debated since Fe&#8208;Fe distances of 2.5&#8208;3.4 &#197; were attributed to &#8220;open&#8221; or &#8220;closed&#8221; cores with bridging or terminal oxo groups. We report the crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization of a FeIII2(&#181;&#8208;O)2 complex (2) with tetrahedral (4C) centres and short Fe&#8208;Fe distance (2.52 &#197;), persisting in organic solutions. 2 shows a large Fe K&#8208;pre&#8208;edge intensity, which is caused by the pronounced asymmetry at the TD Fe(III) centres due to the short Fe&#8208;&#181;&#8208;O bonds. A ~2.5 &#197; Fe&#8208;Fe distance is unlikely for six&#8208;coordinate sites in Q or X, but for a Fe2(&#956;&#8208;O)2 core containing four&#8208;coordinate (or by possible extension five&#8208;coordinate) iron centres there may be enough flexibility to accommodate a particularly short Fe&#8208;Fe separation with intense pre&#8208;edge transition. This finding may broaden the scope of models considered for the structure of high&#8208;valent diiron intermediates formed upon O2 activation in biology.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diiron cofactors in enzymes perform diverse challenging transformations.

         <title>The highly controlled and efficient polymerization of ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The highly controlled and efficient polymerization of ethylene is a very attractive but challenging target. Herein we report on a Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization catalyst, which combines a high degree of control and very high activity in ethylene oligo&#8208; or polymerization with extremely high chain transfer agent (triethylaluminum) to catalyst ratios (catalyst economy). Our Zr catalyst is long living and temperature stable. The chain length of the polyethylene products increases over time under constant ethylene feed or until a certain volume of ethylene is completely consumed to reach the expected molecular weight. Very high activities are observed if the catalyst elongates 60.000 or more alkyl chains and the polydispersity of the strictly linear polyethylene materials obtained are very low. The key for the combination of high control and efficiency seems to be a catalyst stabilized by only one strongly bound monoanionic N&#8208;ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanded Conformations of Monomeric Tau Initiate Its Amyloidogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding early amyloidogenesis is key to rationally develop therapeutic strategies. Tau protein forms well&#8208;characterized pathological deposits but its aggregation mechanism is still poorly understood. Using single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy based on &#160;a mechanical protection strategy, we studied the conformational landscape of the monomeric tau repeat domain (tau&#8208;RD244&#8208;368). We found two sets of conformational states, whose frequency is influenced by mutations and the chemical context. While pathological mutations &#8710;280K and P301L and a pro&#8208;amyloidogenic milieu favored expanded conformations and destabilized local structures, an anti&#8208;amyloidogenic environment promoted a compact ensemble, including a conformer whose topology might mask two amyloidogenic segments. Our results reveal that to initiate aggregation, monomeric tau&#8208;RD244&#8208;368 decreases its polymorphism adopting expanded conformations. This could account for the distinct structures found in vitro and across tauopathies.</dc:description>

         <title>Unimer Exchange is not Necessary for Morphological Transitions in Polymerization Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) has established itself as a powerful and straightforward method to produce polymeric nano&#8208;objects of various morphologies in (aqueous) solution. Generally, spheres are formed in the early stages of polymerization that may evolve to higher order morphologies (worms or vesicles), as the solvophobic block grows during polymerization. Hitherto, the mechanisms involved in these morphological transitions during PISA are still not well understood. Combining a systematic study of a representative PISA system with rheological measurements, we demonstrate that &#8208; unexpectedly &#8208; unimer exchange is not necessary to form higher order morphologies during radical RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA.&#160; Instead, in the investigated aqueous PISA, the monomer present in the polymerization medium is responsible for the morphological transitions, even though it slows down unimer exchange.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Mineralizing Agents on Aluminum Distribution and Acidity of ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intensive research on improving the catalytic properties of zeolites is focused on modulating their acidity and the distribution of associated Al sites. Herein, by studying a series of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites over a broad range of Al content, we demonstrate how the nature of the mineralizing agent (F&#8208; or OH&#8208;) used in hydrothermal syntheses directly impacts Al sites distribution. The proportions of Al sites, probed by 27Al NMR, depend on the Si/Al ratio for F&#8208;, but remain identical for OH&#8208; (from Si/Al=30 to 760). This leads to contrasting variations in weak and strong acidities. Such opposite effect of mineralizers is explained by the spatial location of negative charges and the resulting balance between short&#8208; and long&#8208;range electrostatic interactions. This understanding paves the way for additional and simple opportunities to control zeolites&#8217; acidity.</dc:description>

         <title>An Anomalous&#160;Electron Configuration Among 3d Transition Metal Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Physical properties of materials are mainly determined by valence electron configurations, where different valence shells would induce divergent phenomena. In compounds containing Sc2+, 3d electron occupancy is expected, the same as other transition metal atoms like Ti3+. But this situation still awaits experimental verification. Here, we selected ScS to measure the valence electron density and orbital population of Sc2+ through delicate quantitative convergent&#8208;beam electron diffraction. With the absence of 3d orbital features around Sc&#8208;atom sites and the nearly bare population of t2g orbital, the unintuitive occupation of 4s orbital in Sc2+ is concluded. It should be the first time to report such a special electron configuration in a transition metal compound, in which 4s rather than 3d orbital is preferred. Our findings reveal the distinct behavior of Sc and probable ways to modulate material properties by controlling electron orbitals.</dc:description>

         <title>The First Synthesis of Subporphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Because of the rich coordination chemistry and unique optical and electrochemical properties, porphyrin analogues have been intensively investigated. Among them, subporphyrin has been a long&#8208;awaited molecule, but only the boron complex is known to date because the central boron atom plays a crucial role as a template in the synthesis. The challenge related to the synthesis of a genuine subporphyrin (boron&#8208;free) has finally been met and reported in a recent article from Kim, Osuka, and Song. A key strategy of their synthesis lies in the introduction of an exocyclic double bond at the meso&#8208;position and subsequent reduction to form macrocyclic conjugation. Considering the fact that the flourishing of porphyrin chemistry is ultimately linked to the availability of free base porphyrins, this seminal work will facilitate studies on coordination chemistry and applications in materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Translation of Different mRNAs in Cells via Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Photouncaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coumarin&#8208;based photo&#8208;cleavable 5&#8242; cap analog (CouCap) was synthesized and incorporated into mRNA. In combination with a nitropiperonyl&#8208;protected 5&#8242; cap analog, translation of multiple mRNAs can now be activated by light of different wavelengths. No mRNA sequence nor chemical modifications remain after photo&#8208;cleavage.







Abstract
The 5&#8242; cap is a hallmark of eukaryotic mRNA involved in the initiation of translation. Its modification with a single photo&#8208;cleavable group can bring translation of mRNA under the control of light. However, UV irradiation causes cell stress and downregulation of translation. Furthermore, complex processes often involve timed expression of more than one gene. The approach would thus greatly benefit from the ability to photo&#8208;cleave by blue light and to control more than one mRNA at a time. We report the synthesis of a 5&#8242; cap modified with a 7&#8208;(diethylamino)coumarin (CouCap) and adapted conditions for in vitro transcription. Translation of the resulting CouCap&#8208;mRNA is muted in vitro and in mammalian cells, and can be initiated by irradiation with 450&#8197;nm. The native cap is restored and no non&#8208;natural residues nor sequence alterations remain in the mRNA. Multiplexing for two different mRNAs was achieved by combining cap analogs with coumarin&#8208; and ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;based photo&#8208;cleavable groups.

         <title>(BO)2&#8208;Doped Tetrathia[7]helicene: A Configurationally Stable Blue Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BO&#8208;doped thiahelicene has been synthesized by a four&#8208;step procedure and its optoelectronic and chiroptical properties investigated. The incorporation of two B&#8722;O bonds into the tetrathia[7]helicene framework has resulted in a configurationally stable (&#916;Genant&#8800;=27.4&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) blue emitter (&#934;PL=6&#8201;%).&#8220;







Abstract
Helicenes combine two central themes in chemistry: extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and chirality. Hetero&#8208;atom doping preserves both characteristics and allows modulation of the electronic structure of a helicene. Herein, we report the (BO)2&#8208;doped tetrathia[7]helicene 1, which was prepared from 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene in four steps. 1 is formally derived by substituting two (Mes)B&#8722;O moieties in place of (H)C=C(H) fragments in two benzene rings of the parent tetrathia[7]helicene. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a dihedral angle of 50.26(9)&#176; between the two terminal thiophene rings. The (P)&#8208;/(M)&#8208;1 enantiomers were separated by chiral HPLC and are configurationally stable at room temperature. The experimentally determined enantiomerization barrier of 27.4&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 is lower than that of tetrathia[7]helicene (39.4&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The circular dichroism spectra of (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;1 show a perfect mirror&#8208;image relationship. 1 is a blue emitter (&#955;em=411&#8197;nm) with a photoluminescence quantum efficiency of &#934;PL=6&#8201;% (cf. tetrathia[7]helicene: &#955;em&#8776;405&#8197;nm, &#934;PL=5&#8201;%).

         <title>Helical Bilayer Nonbenzenoid Nanographene Bearing a [10]Helicene with Two Embedded Heptagons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A helical bilayer nonbenzenoid nanographene has been synthesized with a novel [10]helicene backbone bearing two heptagons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed its highly twisted bilayer geometry with a small interlayer distance of 3.2&#8197;&#197;, in which the intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation between the two layers is determined. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties of the P/M enantiomers of this helical nanographene have also been evaluated.







Abstract
The precision synthesis of helical bilayer nanographenes (NGs) with new topology is of substantial interest because of their exotic physicochemical properties. However, helical bilayer NGs bearing non&#8208;hexagonal rings remain synthetically challenging. Here we present the efficient synthesis of the first helical bilayer nonbenzenoid nanographene (HBNG1) from a tailor&#8208;made azulene&#8208;embedded precursor, which contains a novel [10]helicene backbone with two embedded heptagons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis reveals its highly twisted bilayer geometry with a record small interlayer distance of 3.2&#8197;&#197; among the reported helical bilayer NGs. Notably, the close interlayer distance between the two layers offers intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation as revealed by in situ spectroelectrochemistry studies together with DFT simulations. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties of the P/M enantiomers of HBNG1 are also evaluated by circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Reshaping the 2&#8208;Pyrone Synthase Active Site for Chemoselective Biosynthesis of Polyketides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implementation of novel synthetic pathways into metabolic network is challenging. Empowered by protein engineering and synthetic biology, a whole&#8208;cell transformation process is reported to utilize engineered 2&#8208;pyrone synthase with novel reactivity in metabolic networks to convert carboxylic acids and intracellular malonyl&#8208;CoA directly into the pyrone products with high yields, catalytic efficiency and good selectivity.







Abstract
Engineering enzymes with novel reactivity and applying them in metabolic pathways to produce valuable products are quite challenging due to the intrinsic complexity of metabolic networks and the need for high in vivo catalytic efficiency. Triacetic acid lactone (TAL), naturally generated by 2&#8208;pyrone synthase (2PS), is a platform molecule that can be produced via microbial fermentation and further converted into value&#8208;added products. However, these conversions require extra synthetic steps under harsh conditions. We herein report a biocatalytic system for direct generation of TAL derivatives under mild conditions with controlled chemoselectivity by rationally engineering the 2PS active site and then rewiring the biocatalytic pathway in the metabolic network of E.&#8197;coli to produce high&#8208;value products, such as kavalactone precursors, with yields up to 17&#8197;mg/L culture. Computer modeling indicates sterics and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions play key roles in tuning the selectivity, efficiency and yield.

&lt;p&gt;Implementation of novel synthetic pathways into metabolic network is challenging. Empowered by protein engineering and synthetic biology, a whole-cell transformation process is reported to utilize engineered 2-pyrone synthase with novel reactivity in metabolic networks to convert carboxylic acids and intracellular malonyl-CoA directly into the pyrone products with high yields, catalytic efficiency and good selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering enzymes with novel reactivity and applying them in metabolic pathways to produce valuable products are quite challenging due to the intrinsic complexity of metabolic networks and the need for high in vivo catalytic efficiency. Triacetic acid lactone (TAL), naturally generated by 2-pyrone synthase (2PS), is a platform molecule that can be produced via microbial fermentation and further converted into value-added products. However, these conversions require extra synthetic steps under harsh conditions. We herein report a biocatalytic system for direct generation of TAL derivatives under mild conditions with controlled chemoselectivity by rationally engineering the 2PS active site and then rewiring the biocatalytic pathway in the metabolic network of &lt;i&gt;E.&#8197;coli&lt;/i&gt; to produce high-value products, such as kavalactone precursors, with yields up to 17&#8197;mg/L culture. Computer modeling indicates sterics and hydrogen-bond interactions play key roles in tuning the selectivity, efficiency and yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Porosity and Charge Effects in a Supramolecular Porphyrin Cage Promote Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a supramolecular strategy to enhance photochemical reduction of CO2 to CO leveraging synergy between multiple second&#8208;sphere interactions. Post&#8208;synthetic click chemistry enables modular synthesis of porous porphyrin organic cages bearing 24 cationic groups. The coordinated use of both porosity and charge to augment CO2 reduction activity beyond additive effects results in fast and selective catalysis under low CO2 concentrations.







Abstract
We present a supramolecular approach to catalyzing photochemical CO2 reduction through second&#8208;sphere porosity and charge effects. An iron porphyrin box (PB) bearing 24 cationic groups, FePB&#8208;2(P), was made via post&#8208;synthetic modification of an alkyne&#8208;functionalized supramolecular synthon. FePB&#8208;2(P) promotes the photochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with 97&#8201;% selectivity for CO product, achieving turnover numbers (TON) exceeding 7000 and initial turnover frequencies (TOFmax) reaching 1400&#8197;min&#8722;1. The cooperativity between porosity and charge results in a 41&#8208;fold increase in activity relative to the parent Fe tetraphenylporphyrin (FeTPP) catalyst, which is far greater than analogs that augment catalysis through porosity (FePB&#8208;3(N), 4&#8208;fold increase) or charge (Fe p&#8208;tetramethylanilinium porphyrin (Fe&#8208;p&#8208;TMA), 6&#8208;fold increase) alone. This work establishes that synergistic pendants in the secondary coordination sphere can be leveraged as a design element to augment catalysis at primary active sites within confined spaces.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Transfer Hydroiodination of Terminal Alkynes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a shuttle approach for the Rh&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroiodination of terminal alkynes to vinyl iodides. For aliphatic alkynes, a ligand&#8208; and substrate&#8208;dependent stereodivergence is observable. The vinyl iodides are engaged in a variety of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X bond&#8208;forming reactions. The method is used to shorten a synthetic sequence to a cis&#8208;fatty acid. Deuterium&#8208;labeling and stoichiometric experiments give insights into the mechanism.







Abstract
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroiodination of aromatic and aliphatic terminal alkynes is reported. Depending on the choice of ligand and substrate, either (E)&#8208; or (Z)&#8208;configured alkenyl iodides are obtained in high to exclusive isomeric purity. The reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance, employing easily accessible or commercially available aliphatic iodides as HI surrogates through a shuttle process. The synthesized vinyl iodides were applied in several C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions with full retention of the stereoselectivity. The developed method could be used to significantly shorten the total synthesis of a marine cis&#8208;fatty acid. Additionally, initial deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments and stoichiometric reactions shed some light on the potential reaction mechanism.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonding Heteroditopic [2]Catenanes for Recognition of Alkali Metal/Halide Ion Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of halogen bonding heteroditopic [2]catenanes exhibit positive cooperative ion&#8208;pair recognition behaviour, which has been exploited for the extraction of solid sodium or potassium halide salts into organic media. Changing the size of the component macrocycles dramatically influences the ion&#8208;binding affinity, stoichiometry, and ion&#8208;pair complexation mode of the [2]catenanes.







Abstract
The first examples of halogen bonding (XB) heteroditopic homo[2]catenanes were prepared by discrete Na+ template&#8208;directed assembly of oligo(ethylene glycol) units derived from XB donor&#8208;containing macrocycles and acyclic bis&#8208;azide precursors, followed by a CuI&#8208;mediated azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition macrocyclisation reaction. Extensive 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopic studies show the [2]catenane hosts exhibit positive cooperative ion&#8208;pair recognition behaviour, wherein XB&#8208;mediated halide recognition is enhanced by alkali metal cation pre&#8208;complexation. Notably, subtle changes in the catenanes&#8217; oligo(ethylene glycol) chain length dramatically alters their ion&#8208;binding affinity, stoichiometry, complexation mode, and conformational dynamics. Solution&#8208;phase and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies provide evidence for competing host&#8208;separated and direct&#8208;contact ion&#8208;pair binding modes. We further demonstrate the [2]catenanes are capable of extracting solid alkali&#8208;metal halide salts into organic media.

         <title>The Eschenmoser's Salt as a Formylation Agent for the Synthesis of Indolizinecarbaldehydes and Their Use for Colorimetric Nitrite Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the unprecedented use of the Eschemoser's salt&#8212;a well&#8208;known and commercial reagent for (dimethylamino)methylation reactions&#8212;as a formylation agent of indolizines. The method is simple and mild, whereas the classical formylation methods failed. Moreover, some indolizinecarbaldehydes have been transformed into highly conjugated push&#8208;pull dyes and have proven to be selective and sensitive colorimetric anion sensors for nitrite detection.







Abstract
C&#8722;H bond formylation is the most immediate way to incorporate the versatile formyl group into (hetero)aromatics. However, the type of reagents and severe conditions involved in the classical formylation methods often curtail their application, especially in the presence of other functional groups. Herein, we present the Eschenmoser's salt, a commercially available (dimethylamino)methylating chemical, as a useful reagent for the C&#8722;H formylation of indolizines and other compounds. The method is straightforward and mild, furnishing indolizinecarbaldehydes in modest&#8208;to&#8208;good yields with exclusive and remote regioselectivity. Furthermore, these compounds can be easily transformed into push&#8208;pull dyes and are highly selective in the colorimetric detection of nitrite, a substance extensively employed as preservative in the food industry, the concentration of which is crucial to control to prevent harmful effects in living organisms. The assay is simple, allowing the naked&#8208;eye detection of nitrite in solution or on a cotton swab for a wide range of concentrations.

         <title>Benchmark Dynamics of Dipolar Molecular Rotors in Fluorinated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al&#8208;MOF, constructed with a wheelshaped ligand containing geminal rotating fluorine atoms shows a fluid configuration landscape in crystals, even at 2&#8197;K. The multiple configurational interchanges that arise from a correlated cascade mechanism propagating through the structure, as shown by Molecular Dynamics, phonon calculations and NMR relaxation, occur even at temperatures that usually prohibit any dipole rotation.







Abstract
Fluorinated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs), comprising a wheel&#8208;shaped ligand with geminal rotating fluorine atoms, produced benchmark mobility of correlated dipolar rotors at 2&#8197;K, with practically null activation energy (Ea=17&#8197;cal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). 1H T1 NMR revealed multiple relaxation phenomena due to the exchange among correlated dipole&#8208;rotor configurations. Synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction at 4&#8197;K, Density Functional Theory, Molecular Dynamics and phonon calculations showed the fluid landscape and pointed out a cascade mechanism converting dipole configurations into each other. Gas accessibility, shown by hyperpolarized&#8208;Xe NMR, allowed for chemical stimuli intervention: CO2 triggered dipole reorientation, reducing their collective dynamics and stimulating a dipole configuration change in the crystal.

&lt;p&gt;Al-MOF, constructed with a wheelshaped ligand containing geminal rotating fluorine atoms shows a fluid configuration landscape in crystals, even at 2&#8197;K. The multiple configurational interchanges that arise from a correlated cascade mechanism propagating through the structure, as shown by Molecular Dynamics, phonon calculations and NMR relaxation, occur even at temperatures that usually prohibit any dipole rotation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorinated Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), comprising a wheel-shaped ligand with geminal rotating fluorine atoms, produced benchmark mobility of correlated dipolar rotors at 2&#8197;K, with practically null activation energy (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=17&#8197;cal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; NMR revealed multiple relaxation phenomena due to the exchange among correlated dipole-rotor configurations. Synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction at 4&#8197;K, Density Functional Theory, Molecular Dynamics and phonon calculations showed the fluid landscape and pointed out a cascade mechanism converting dipole configurations into each other. Gas accessibility, shown by hyperpolarized-Xe NMR, allowed for chemical stimuli intervention: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; triggered dipole reorientation, reducing their collective dynamics and stimulating a dipole configuration change in the crystal. Dynamic materials under limited thermal noise and high responsiveness enable the fabrication of molecular machines with low energy dissipation and controllable dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Luminescent Chiral Nanographene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perylene&#8208;based chiral nanographene has been synthesized through helical &#960;&#8208;extension of highly emissive chromophores whilst maintaining the frontier molecular orbital distributions. This nanographene exhibits excellent luminescence properties, with a record high &#934;F of 93&#8201;% among chiral nanographenes and a remarkable CPL brightness of 32&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Chiral nanographenes with both high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) and large dissymmetry factors (glum) are essential to the development of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. However, most studies have been focused on the improvement of glum, whereas how to design highly emissive chiral nanographenes is still unclear. In this work, we propose a new design strategy to achieve chiral nanographenes with high &#934;F by helical &#960;&#8208;extension of strongly luminescent chromophores while maintaining the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) distribution pattern. Chiral nanographene with perylene as the core and two dibenzo[6]helicene fragments as the wings has been synthesized, which exhibits a record high &#934;F of 93&#8201;% among the reported chiral nanographenes and excellent CPL brightness (BCPL) of 32&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Nanoporous Films with Oriented Arrays of Molecular Motors for Photoswitching the Guest Adsorption and Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regular array of oriented molecular motors is presented by incorporating overcrowded alkene molecules as linker in metal&#8211;organic framework thin films. By switching between the stable and metastable states, the adsorption and diffusion properties of the guest molecules are controlled.







Abstract
Molecular motors are fascinating nanomachines. However, constructing smart materials from such functional molecules presents a severe challenge in material science. Here, we present a bottom&#8208;up layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of oriented overcrowded&#8208;alkene molecular motors forming a crystalline metal&#8211;organic framework thin film. While all stator parts of the overcrowded&#8208;alkene motors are oriented perpendicular to the substrate, the rotors point into the pores, which are large enough allowing for the light&#8208;induced molecular rotation. Taking advantage of the thin film's transparency, the motor rotation and its activation energy are determined by UV/Vis spectroscopy. As shown by gravimetric uptake experiments, molecular motors in crystalline porous materials are used, for the first time, to control the adsorption and diffusion properties of guest molecules in the pores, here, by switching with light between the (meta&#8208;)stable states. The work demonstrates the potential of designed materials with molecular motors and indicates a path for the future development of smart materials.

         <title>Aqueous Photoelectrochemical CO2 Reduction to CO and Methanol over a Silicon Photocathode Functionalized with a Cobalt Phthalocyanine Molecular Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoelectrode assembly based on planar p&#8208;typle silicon and a cobalt phthalocyanine molecular catalyst is developed for photoelectrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and methanol under solar irradiation and in aqueous media.







Abstract
We report a precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free molecular catalyst&#8208;based photocathode that is active for aqueous CO2 reduction to CO and methanol. The photoelectrode is composed of cobalt phthalocyanine molecules anchored on graphene oxide which is integrated via a (3&#8208;aminopropyl)triethoxysilane linker to p&#8208;type silicon protected by a thin film of titanium dioxide. The photocathode reduces CO2 to CO with high selectivity at potentials as mild as 0&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE). Methanol production is observed at an onset potential of &#8722;0.36&#8197;V vs RHE, and reaches a peak turnover frequency of 0.18&#8197;s&#8722;1. To date, this is the only molecular catalyst&#8208;based photoelectrode that is active for the six&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to methanol. This work puts forth a strategy for interfacing molecular catalysts to p&#8208;type semiconductors and demonstrates state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance for photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction to CO and methanol.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;Bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z
</title>

         <dc:description>
A C(13)/C(13&#8242;) bis&#8208;desmethyl analogue of the natural product disorazole&#8197;Z has been prepared by cyclodimerization through double Stille cross&#8208;coupling as the key enabling step. C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;Bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z binds to tubulin in a very similar mode as the natural product and inhibits cancer cell proliferation in vitro with low nanomolar potency, thus retaining the potent growth inhibitory capacity of disorazole&#8197;Z.







Abstract
We describe the total synthesis of the macrodiolide C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z through double inter&#8208;/intramolecular Stille cross&#8208;coupling of a monomeric vinyl stannane/vinyl iodide precursor to form the macrocycle. The key step in the synthesis of this precursor was a stereoselective aldol reaction of a formal Evans acetate aldol product with crotonaldehyde. As demonstrated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, the binding mode of C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z to tubulin is virtually identical with that of the natural product disorazole&#8197;Z. Likewise, C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z inhibits tubulin assembly with at least the same potency as disorazole&#8197;Z and it appears to be a more potent cell growth inhibitor.

         <title>Boraalkenes Made by a Hydroboration Route: Cycloaddition and B=C Bond Cleavage Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkene hydroboration by the in situ generated IMes(X)BH+ cations followed by deprotonation gave the neutral boraalkenes. They underwent [2+2] cycloaddition with a variety of heterocumulenes among them carbon dioxide and carbon disulfide. A two&#8208;step reaction sequence led to the formal CS2 insertion product with complete rupture of the B=C double bond. A boraalkene/CO2 cycloaddition product opened its core B&#8722;C bond upon treatment with HB(C6F5)2.







Abstract
Hydroboration of styrene or vinylcyclohexane with the IMes(C6F5)BH+ cation followed by deprotonation provided a convenient synthetic entry to the [B]=CHCH2R boraalkenes 9&#8201;a and 9&#8201;b. The in situ generated IMes(SCN)BH+ system reacted similarly with 1,1&#8208;diphenylethene followed by deprotonation to give the isothiocyanato substituted boraalkene 9&#8201;c. The boraalkenes underwent [2+2] cycloaddition reactions with a small series of heterocumulenes to give the respective four&#8208;membered heterocycles. The [B]=CHCH2R+CO2 cycloadducts 13&#8201;a and 13&#8201;b added the borane HB(C6F5)2 with cleavage of the central B&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond. CS2 underwent an unusual reaction with the boraalkenes, namely insertion into the B=C bond with formation of the borylated dithioketene acetal under complete rupture of the strong B=C double bond. The intermediate dithiobora&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactone type intermediate was isolated in the case of the isothiocyanato&#8208;boraalkene reaction and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction.

&lt;p&gt;Alkene hydroboration by the in situ generated IMes(X)BH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations followed by deprotonation gave the neutral boraalkenes. They underwent [2+2] cycloaddition with a variety of heterocumulenes among them carbon dioxide and carbon disulfide. A two-step reaction sequence led to the formal CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; insertion product with complete rupture of the B=C double bond. A boraalkene/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cycloaddition product opened its core B&#8722;C bond upon treatment with HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>Tough and Conductive Nacre&#8208;inspired MXene/Epoxy Layered Bulk Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural nacre provides an inspiration for fabricating tough and conductive MXene/epoxy layered bulk nanocomposites through strong interfacial interactions between MXene and epoxy resin. The resultant conductive nacre&#8208;like layered bulk nanocomposites show self&#8208;monitoring of the structural integrity and outstanding electromagnetic interference shielding.







Abstract
A long&#8208;standing quest in materials science has been the development of tough epoxy resin nanocomposites for use in numerous applications. Inspired by nacre, here we report tough and conductive MXene/epoxy layered bulk nanocomposites. The orientation of MXene lamellar scaffolds is enhanced by annealing treatment. The improved interfacial interactions between MXene lamellar scaffold and epoxy through surface chemical modification resulted in a synergistic effect. Tailoring the interlayer spacing of MXene nanosheets to a critical distance resulted in a fracture toughness about eight times higher than that of pure epoxy, surpassing other epoxy nanocomposites. Our nacre&#8208;inspired MXene/epoxy layered bulk nanocomposites also show high electrical conductivity that provides self&#8208;monitoring capability for structural integrity and exhibits an excellent electromagnetic interference shielding efficiency. Our proposed strategy provides an avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance epoxy nanocomposites.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on Covalent Triazine Frameworks: at the Crossroad between Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review highlights single&#8208;atom catalysis on covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), thus focusing on the available insights on factors influencing nuclearity and coordination environment of metal species on CTFs and the effect on catalytic performance.







Abstract
Heterogeneous single&#8208;site and single&#8208;atom catalysts potentially enable combining the high catalytic activity and selectivity of molecular catalysts with the easy continuous operation and recycling of solid catalysts. In recent years, covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) found increasing attention as support materials for particulate and isolated metal species. Bearing a high fraction of nitrogen sites, they allow coordinating molecular metal species and stabilizing particulate metal species, respectively. Dependent on synthesis method and pretreatment of CTFs, materials resembling well&#8208;defined highly crosslinked polymers or materials comparable to structurally ill&#8208;defined nitrogen&#8208;containing carbons result. Accordingly, CTFs serve as model systems elucidating the interaction of single&#8208;site, single&#8208;atom and particulate metal species with such supports. Factors influencing the transition between molecular and particulate systems are discussed to allow deriving tailored catalyst systems.

         <title>Giant Water Uptake Enabled Ultrahigh Proton Conductivity of Graphdiyne Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphdiyne oxide (GDYO) featuring a sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;co&#8208;hybridized carbon matrix is found to show ultrahigh proton conductivity. The unique carbon hybridization enables the significant water uptake of GDYO. The giant water uptake of GDYO is beneficial for the formation of multiple proton conduction pathways and the dissociation of a huge numbers of protons, thus leading to ultrahigh proton conductivity.







Abstract
Proton conductors have attracted great attention in various fields, especially in energy production. Here, we find that graphdiyne oxide (GDYO), derived from graphdiyne (GDY), features the highest proton conductivity of 0.54&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (100&#8201;% RH, 348&#8197;K) among the oxidized carbon allotropes reported so far. The sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;co&#8208;hybridized carbon skeleton of GDY enables GDYO with the giant water uptake, which is 2.4 times larger than that of graphene oxide (GO), resulting in ultrahigh proton conductivity by increasing the proton concentration and proton conduction pathways. This ultrahigh proton conductivity of GDYO is further proved in a methanol fuel cell by using GDYO membrane as proton exchange membrane. The GDYO membrane enables the cell with higher open circuit voltage, larger power density and lower methanol permeability, compared with commercial Nafion 117. Moreover, the GDYO membrane bears high ion exchange capacity, good acidic stability and low swelling ratio.

         <title>Blending to Make Nonhealable Polymers Healable: Nanophase Separation Observed by CP/MAS 13C NMR Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blending with only 20&#8197;mol&#8201;% of PTUEG3 resulted in making PTUC8 to be self&#8208;healable at ambient temperatures without spoiling its non&#8208;hygroscopic properties. A nanophase&#8208;separated structure as observed by CP/MAS 13C NMR spectroscopy is responsible: PTUEG3&#8208;rich domains certainly contribute to the self&#8208;healing properties, while PTUC8&#8208;rich non&#8208;hygroscopic domains likely prevent the polymer blend from humidity&#8208;induced plasticization.







Abstract
Can commodity polymers are made to be healable just by blending with self&#8208;healable polymers? Here we report the first study on the fundamental aspect of this practically challenging issue. Poly(ether thiourea) (PTUEG3; Tg=27&#8201;&#176;C) reported in 2018 is extraordinary in that it is mechanically robust but can self&#8208;heal even at 12&#8201;&#176;C. In contrast, poly(octamethylene thiourea) (PTUC8; Tg=50&#8201;&#176;C), an analogue of PTUEG3, cannot heal below 92&#8201;&#176;C. We found that their polymer blend self&#8208;healed in a temperature range above 32&#8201;&#176;C even when its PTUEG3 content was only 20&#8197;mol&#8201;%. Unlike PTUEG3 alone, this polymer blend, upon exposure to high humidity, barely plasticized, keeping its excellent mechanical properties due to the non&#8208;hygroscopic nature of the PTUC8 component. CP/MAS 13C NMR analysis revealed that the polymer blend was nanophase&#8208;separated, which possibly accounts for why such a small amount of PTUEG3 provided the polymer blend with humidity&#8208;tolerant self&#8208;healable properties.

         <title>Synthesis of Fibrous Phosphorus Micropillar Arrays with Pyro&#8208;Phototronic Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed transformations of amorphous red phosphorus (ARP) structures lead to the self&#8208;assembled synthesis of high&#8208;quality, large&#8208;scale fibrous phosphorus micropillar (FP&#8208;MP) arrays with pyro&#8208;phototronic effects.







Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up preparation of two&#8208;dimensional material micro&#8208;nano structures at scale facilitates the realisation of integrated applications in optoelectronic devices. Fibrous Phosphorus (FP), an allotrope of black phosphorus (BP), is one of the most promising candidate materials in the field of optoelectronics with its unique crystal structure and properties.[1] However, to date, there are no bottom&#8208;up micro&#8208;nano structure preparation methods for crystalline phosphorus allotropes.[1c,&#8201;2] Herein, we present the bottom&#8208;up preparation of fibrous phosphorus micropillar (FP&#8208;MP) arrays via a low&#8208;pressure gas&#8208;phase transport (LP&#8208;CVT) method that controls the directional phase transition from amorphous red phosphorus (ARP) to FP. In addition, self&#8208;powered photodetectors (PD) of FP&#8208;MP arrays with pyro&#8208;phototronic effects achieved detection beyond the band gap limit. Our results provide a new approach for bottom&#8208;up preparation of other crystalline allotropes of phosphorus.

         <title>Porous Materials for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water pollution is a growing threat to humanity due to the pervasiveness of contaminants in water bodies. Significant efforts have been made to separate these hazardous components to purify polluted water through various methods. However, conventional remediation methods suffer from limitations such as low uptake capacity or selectivity and can&#8217;t meet current water quality standards. Recently, advanced porous materials (APMs) have shown promise of improved segregation of contaminants over traditional porous materials in uptake capacity and selectivity. These materials feature merits of high surface area and versatile functionality, rendering them ideal platforms for the design of novel adsorbents. This review summarizes the development and employment of APMs in a variety of water treatments accompanied by assessments of task&#8208;specific adsorption performance. Finally, our perspectives on future opportunities for APMs in water purification have been discussed, as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Computer&#8208;Driven Development of Ylide Functionalized Phosphines for Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hiyama Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed couplings of silicon enolates with aryl electrophiles are of great synthetic utility, but often limited to expensive bromide substrates. A comparative experimental study confirmed that none of the established ligand systems allows to couple inexpensive aryl chlorides with &#945;&#8208;trimethylsilyl alkylnitriles. In contrast, ylide functionalized phosphines (YPhos) led to encouraging results. A statistical model was developed that correlates the reaction yields with ligand features. It was employed to predict catalyst structures with superior performance. With this cheminformatics approach, YPhos ligands were tailored specifically to the demands of Hiyama couplings. The newly synthesized ligands displayed record&#8208;setting activities, enabling the elusive coupling of aryl chlorides with &#945;&#8208;trimethylsilyl alkyl nitriles. The preparative utility of the catalyst system was demonstrated by the synthesis of pharmaceutically meaningful &#945;&#8208;aryl alkylnitriles, &#945;&#8208;arylcarbonyls and biaryls.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Generation of Hydrogen Radical (H&#8226;) with GSH for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a reactive hydrogen species, hydrogen radical (H&#8226;) scarcely sees applications in tumor biological therapy due to very limited resources of bio&#8208;friendly H&#8226; generator. In this work, we report that TAF can act as an organic photosensitizer as well as an efficient photocatalytic H&#8226; generator with reduced glutathione (GSH) as a fuel. The intracellular H&#8226;&#8208;participating photocatalysis leads to cell death by triple amplification of oxidative stress via a hybrid ferroptosis&#8208;apoptosis pathway under normoxia or apoptosis through biological reductions under hypoxia. TAF presents ultrahigh photocytotoxicity and excellent biosafety with photocytotoxicity index at an order of magnitude of 102&#8722;103 on both normoxic and hypoxic cells. The in vitro data suggest that H&#8226; therapy is promising to overcome the challenge of tumor hypoxia at low doses of both photocatalyst and light. And the capability of near infrared two&#8208;photon excitation would benefit broad biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;state Fluorescence from Carbon Dots Widely Tunable from Blue to Deep Red through Surface Ligand Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) find widespread attention due to their remarkable fluorescent and electronic properties. However, aggregation&#8208;caused quenching currently limits the application of CDs in colored displays. The construction of CDs with color&#8208;tunable solid&#8208;state fluorescence (SSF) is rarely reported, since the preparation of SSF CDs is technically challenging. Herein, through surface ligand modulation, SSF CDs with an emission&#8208;color span of almost 300 nm (from blue to deep red) were obtained. In&#8208;depth structure&#8208;property studies reveal that intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding inside SSF CDs provokes the emission properties in the aggregated state. Photodynamic characterizations demonstrate emission wavelengths can be switched smoothly by deliberately altering conjugation ability between substituent ligands and CDs core. Three&#8208;dimensional printing patterning is used to create a range of emissive objects, demonstrating the commercial potential for use in optical lamps.</dc:description>

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable Dual&#8208;Mode Organic Afterglow from Classical Aggregation&#8208;Caused Quenching Compounds for White&#8208;light&#8208;Manipulated Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Color&#8208;tunable dual&#8208;mode organic afterglow excited by ultraviolet (UV)&#160;and white light was achieved from classical aggregation&#8208;caused quenching compounds for the first time. Specifically, two luminescent systems, which could produce significant organic afterglow composed of persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and ultralong organic phosphorescence at ambient conditions, were constructed by doping fluorescein sodium and calcein sodium into aluminum sulfate. Their lifetimes surpassed 600 ms, and the dopant concentrations were as low as 5[[EQUATION]]10&#8208;6wt%. Moreover, the persistent luminescence colors of the materials could be tuned from blue to green and then to yellow by simply varying the concentrations of guest compounds or the temperature in the range of 260~340 K. Inspired by these exciting results, the afterglow materials were used for UV&#8208; and white&#8208;light&#8208;manipulated anti&#8208;counterfeiting and preparation of elastomers with different colors of persistent luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Altering oxygen binding by redox&#8208;inactive metal substitution to control catalytic activity: oxygen reduction on manganese oxide nanoparticles as a model system</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Establishing generic catalyst design principles by identifying structural features of materials that influence their performance will advance the rational engineering of new catalytic materials. In this study, by investigating metal&#8208;substituted manganese oxide (spinel) nanoparticles, Mn3O4:M (M = Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu), we rationalize the dependence of the activity of Mn3O4:M for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the enthalpy of formation of the binary MO oxide, &#916;fH&#176;(MO), and the Lewis acidity of the M2+ substituent. Incorporation of elements M with low &#916;fH&#176;(MO) enhances the oxygen binding strength in Mn3O4:M, which affects its activity in ORR due to the established correlation between ORR activity and the binding energy of *O/*OH/*OOH species. Our work provides a perspective on the design of new compositions for oxygen electrocatalysis relying on the rational substitution/doping by redox&#8208;inactive elements.</dc:description>

         <title>Comprehensive H2O Molecules Regulation via Deep Eutectic Solvents&#160;for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The corrosion, parasitic reactions, and aggravated dendrite growth severely restrict development of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Here, we report a novel strategy to break the hydrogen bond network between water molecules and construct the sulfolane&#8722;H2O deep eutectic solvents. This strategy cuts off the transfer of protons/hydroxides and inhibits the activity of H2O, as reflected in a much lower freezing point (&lt; &#8722;80 &#176;C), a significantly larger electrochemical stable window (&gt; 3 V), and suppressed evaporative water from electrolytes. Stable Zn plating/stripping for over 9600 h was obtained. Based on experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations, it has been proved that sulfolane can effectively regulate solvation shell and simultaneously build the multifunctional Zn&#8722;electrolyte interface. Moreover, the multi&#8208;layer homemade modular cell and 1.32 Ah pouch cell further confirm its prospect for practical application.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Approach to Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers via Catalytic Atroposelective Transfer Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diaryl ethers are widespread in biologically active compounds, ligands and catalysts. It is known that the diaryl ether skeleton may exhibit atropisomerism when both aryl rings are unsymmetrically substituted by steric hindered groups. Despite recent advances, only a very few catalytic asymmetric methods have been developed to construct such kind of axially chiral compounds. We described herein a dynamic kinetic resolution approach to axially chiral diaryl ethers via Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed atroposelective transfer hydrogenation (ATH) reaction of dicarbaldehydes with anilines. The desired diaryl ethers could be obtained in moderate to good chemical yields (up to 79%) and high enantioselectivities (up to 95% ee) under standard reaction conditions. Such structural motifs are interesting precursors for further transformations and may have potential applications in synthesis of chiral ligands or catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Activity of Enzyme Immobilized on Hydrophobic ZIF&#8208;8 Modified by Ni2+ Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient enzyme immobilization to promote their recyclability and activity is highly desirable. Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) has been proved to be effective platforms for enzyme immobilization due to its easy preparation and biocompatibility. However, the intrinsic hydrophobic characteristic hinders its further development in this filed. Herein, a facile synthesis approach was developed to immobilize pepsin (PEP) on the ZIF&#8208;8 carrier by using Ni2+ ions as anchor (ZIF&#8208;8@PEP&#8208;Ni). By contrast, the direct coating of PEP on the surface of ZIF&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8@PEP) engendered significant conformational changes. Electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was employed to study the catalytic activity of immobilized PEP. The ZIF&#8208;8@PEP&#8208;Ni composite attains remarkable OER performance with an ultralow overpotential of only 127 mV at 10 mA&#8226;cm&#8208;2, which is much lower than the 690 and 919 mV&#8226;cm&#8208;2 overpotential values of ZIF&#8208;8@PEP and PEP, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>The Asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig Amination Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past few decades, the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig reaction has emerged as a powerful tool for forging C&#8211;N bonds, and has been vital to the pharmaceuticals, materials, and catalysis fields. However, asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination for constructing point chirality, planar chirality, and axial chirality remain in their infancy owing to limited substrate scope and laggard ligand design. The recent surge in interest in the synthesis of C&#8211;N/N&#8211;N atropisomers, has witnessed a renaissance in asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination chemistry as the first practical protocol for the preparation of C&#8211;N atropisomers. This review highlights reported asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination protocols and provides a brief overview of their chemical practicality.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Strategy for Screening Custom&#8208;Designed Warhead&#8208;Armed Cyclic Peptide Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Demand for peptide&#8208;based pharmaceuticals has been steadily increasing, but only limited success has been achieved to date. To expedite peptide&#8208;based drug discovery, we developed a general scheme for cell&#8208;based screening of cyclic peptide inhibitors armed with a user&#8208;designed warhead. We combined unnatural amino acid incorporation and split intein&#8208;mediated peptide cyclization techniques and integrated a yeast&#8208;based colorimetric screening assay to generate a new scheme that we call the custom&#8208;designed warhead&#8208;armed cyclic peptide screening platform (CWCPS). This strategy successfully discovered a potent inhibitor, CY5&#8208;6Q, that targets human histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) with a KD value of 15 nM. This approach can be a versatile and general platform for discovering cyclic peptide inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Tension PAINT Imaging with a Molecular Beacon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;PAINT enabled super&#8208;resolution imaging through the transient binding of fluorescently&#8208;labelled single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) imagers to target ssDNA. However, its performance is constrained by imager background fluorescence, resulting in relatively long image acquisition and potential artifacts. We designed a molecular beacon (MB) as the PAINT imager. Unbound MB in solution reduces the background fluorescence due to its natively quenched state. They are fluorogenic upon binding to target DNA to create individual fluorescence events. We demonstrate that MB&#8208;PAINT provides localization precision similar to traditional linear imager DNA&#8208;PAINT. We also show that MB&#8208;PAINT is ideally suited for fast super&#8208;resolution imaging of molecular tension probes in living cells, eliminating the potential of artifacts from free&#8208;diffusing imagers in traditional DNA&#8208;PAINT at the cell&#8208;substrate interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper Complexes with Diazoolefin Ligands and their Photochemical Conversion into Alkenylidene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I) complex with a diazoolefin ligand was converted into an alkenylidene complex by in crystallo photolysis.







Abstract
Homometallic copper complexes with alkenylidene ligands are discussed as intermediates in catalysis but the isolation of such complexes has remained elusive. Herein, we report the structural characterization of copper complexes with bridging and terminal alkenylidene ligands. The compounds were obtained by irradiation of CuI complexes with N&#8208;heterocyclic diazoolefin ligands. The complex with a terminal alkenylidene ligand required isolation in a crystalline matrix, and its structural characterization was enabled by in crystallo photolysis at low temperature.

         <title>CAPturAM, a Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Strategy for Selective Enrichment and Detection of Physiological CAPAM&#8208;Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CAPturAM, an antibody&#8208;free chemical biology approach, allows for direct enrichment and detection of physiological CAPAM&#8208;targets by harnessing CAPAM's cosubstrate promiscuity to install propargyl groups on all its targets. These are then functionalized with an affinity handle, enriched, and assessed via RT&#8208;qPCR.







Abstract
Modified nucleotides impact all aspects of eukaryotic mRNAs and contribute to regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional and translational level. At the 5&#8242; cap, adenosine as first transcribed nucleotide is often N6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methyl adenosine (m6Am). This modification is tissue dependent and reversible, pointing to a regulatory function. CAPAM was recently identified as methyltransferase responsible for m6Am formation, however, the direct assignment of its target transcripts proves difficult. Antibodies do not discriminate between internal N6&#8208;methyl adenosine (m6A) and m6Am. Here we present CAPturAM, an antibody&#8208;free chemical biology approach for direct enrichment and probing of physiological CAPAM&#8208;targets. We harness CAPAM's cosubstrate promiscuity to install propargyl groups on its targets. Subsequent functionalization with an affinity handle allows for their enrichment. Using wildtype and CAPAM&#8722;/&#8722; cells, we successfully applied CAPturAM to confirm or disprove CAPAM&#8208;targets, facilitating the verification and identification of CAPAM targets.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Networks Locking on Inorganic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs), single&#8208;layer networks of covalently linked monomers, show perspectives as membranes and in electronics. However, 2D polymerization of monomers in orthogonal directions limited the formation of 2DPs on nanoparticles (NPs) with high surface curvatures. Here we propose a high&#8208;curvature 2D polymerization to form a single&#8208;layer 2DP network as a non&#8208;contacting ligand on the surface of NPs for their stabilization and functionalization. The high&#8208;curvature 2D polymerization of amphiphilic Gemini monomers was conducted in&#8208;situ on surfaces of NPs with various sizes, shapes, and materials, forming highly cross&#8208;linked 2DPs. Selective etching of core&#8208;shell NPs led to 2DPs as a non&#8208;contact ligand of yolk&#8208;shell structures with excellent shape retention and high NP&#8208;surface accessibility. In addition, by copolymerization, the 2DP ligands can covalently link to other functional molecules. This work promotes the development of 2DPs on NPs for their functional modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Interbacterial Chemical Communication&#8208;Triggered Nascent Proteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CAPPEX strategy enables communication&#8208;triggered nascent proteomic analysis in complex bacterial populations. Applying CAPPEX, a tryptophan&#8208;indole axis that contributes to the colonization resistance of commensal E. coli to Salmonella was discovered.







Abstract
Metabolic labeling with clickable noncanonical amino acids has enabled nascent proteome profiling, which can be performed in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. However, nascent proteomics in an intercellular communication&#8208;dependent manner remains challenging. Here we develop communication&#8208;activated profiling of protein expression (CAPPEX), which integrates the LuxI/LuxR quorum sensing circuit with the cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific nascent proteomics method to enable selective click&#8208;labeling of newly synthesized proteins in a specific bacterium upon receiving chemical signals from another reporter bacterium. CAPPEX reveals that E. coli competes with Salmonella for tryptophan as the precursor for indole, and the resulting indole suppressed the expression of virulence factors in Salmonella. This tryptophan&#8208;indole axis confers attenuation of Salmonella invasion in host cells and living mice. The CAPPEX strategy should be widely applicable for investigating various interbacterial communication processes.

         <title>f&#8208;block MOFs: A Pathway to Heterometallic Transuranics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like baking cookies to personal taste, preparation of a library of heterometallic actinide&#8208;MOFs allows for tailoring of the &#8220;flavor&#8221; of material properties. Mixing the radionuclide ingredients in proper ratios reveals structure&#8211;property relationships and unique design principles for new classes of actinide&#8208;based materials.

A novel series of heterometallic f&#8208;block&#8208;frameworks including the first examples of transuranic heterometallic 238U/239Pu&#8208;metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and a novel monometallic 239Pu&#8208;analog are reported. In combination with theoretical calculations, we probed the kinetics and thermodynamics of heterometallic actinide(An)&#8208;MOF formation and reported the first value of a U&#8208;to&#8208;Th transmetallation rate. We concluded that formation of uranyl species could be a driving force for solid&#8208;state metathesis. Density of states near the Fermi edge, enthalpy of formation, band gap, proton affinity, and thermal/chemical stability were probed as a function of metal ratios. Furthermore, we achieved 97&#8201;% of the theoretical maximum capacity for An&#8208;integration. These studies shed light on fundamental aspects of actinide chemistry and also foreshadow avenues for the development of emerging classes of An&#8208;containing materials, including radioisotope thermoelectric generators or metalloradiopharmaceuticals.

&lt;p&gt;Like baking cookies to personal taste, preparation of a library of heterometallic actinide-MOFs allows for tailoring of the &#8220;flavor&#8221; of material properties. Mixing the radionuclide ingredients in proper ratios reveals structure&#8211;property relationships and unique design principles for new classes of actinide-based materials. In addition, the prepared frameworks provide a recipe for novel, pre-designed transuranic MOFs.

         <title>Expanding the Toolbox of Target Directed Bio&#8208;Orthogonal Synthesis: In Situ Direct Macrocyclization by DNA Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the first instance of bioorthogonal macrocyclization directed by non&#8208;canonical DNAs as templates. The size complementarity of the macrocyclic core with the G&#8208;quartet of a G&#8208;quadruplex DNA plays a key role to drive the macrocyclization over oligomerization. In cellulo macrocyclization has also been established leading to a peptidomimetic macrocycle with promising therapeutic properties.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that noncanonical DNA can direct macrocyclization&#8208;like challenging reactions to synthesize gene modulators. The planar G&#8208;quartets present in DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) provide a size complementary reaction platform for the bio&#8208;orthogonal macrocyclization of bifunctional azide and alkyne fragments over oligo&#8208; and polymerization. G4s immobilized on gold&#8208;coated magnetic nanoparticles have been used as target templates to enable easy identification of a selective peptidomimetic macrocycle. Structurally similar macrocycles have been synthesized to understand their functional role in the modulation of gene function. The innate fluorescence of the in situ formed macrocycle has been utilized to monitor its cellular localization using a G4 antibody and its in cell formation from the corresponding azide and alkyne fragments. The successful execution of in situ macrocyclization in vitro and in cells would open up a new dimension for target&#8208;directed therapeutic applications.

Carbon&#8208;13 Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (C&#8208;13 RASER) is demonstrated on a bolus of liquid hyperpolarized ethyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate. Spontaneous RASER signal emissions were detected using a non&#8208;cryogenic 1.4T&#8197;NMR spectrometer equipped with a radio&#8208;frequency detection coil with a quality factor of 32 without any modifications for over 3&#8197;minutes, paving the way to new frontiers for HP 13C contrast agents.







Abstract
The feasibility of Carbon&#8208;13 Radiofrequency (RF) Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (C&#8208;13 RASER) is demonstrated on a bolus of liquid hyperpolarized ethyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate. Hyperpolarized ethyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate was prepared via pairwise addition of parahydrogen to vinyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate and polarization transfer from nascent parahydrogen&#8208;derived protons to the carbon&#8208;13 nucleus via magnetic field cycling yielding C&#8208;13 nuclear spin polarization of approximately 6&#8201;%. RASER signals were detected from samples with concentration ranging from 0.12 to 1&#8197;M concentration using a non&#8208;cryogenic 1.4T&#8197;NMR spectrometer equipped with a radio&#8208;frequency detection coil with a quality factor (Q) of 32 without any modifications. C&#8208;13 RASER signals were observed for several minutes on a single bolus of hyperpolarized substrate to achieve 21&#8197;mHz NMR linewidths. The feasibility of creating long&#8208;lasting C&#8208;13 RASER on biomolecular carriers opens a wide range of new opportunities for the rapidly expanding field of C&#8208;13 magnetic resonance hyperpolarization.

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence through Cooperative and Energy&#8208;Transfer Mechanisms in Yb3+&#8208;Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC) and Yb3+ ions were assembled into Yb&#8208;BTC metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Yb&#8208;BTC MOFs) showing upconversion luminescence under near&#8208;infrared excitation via cooperative luminescence. In addition, various activators were doped into the Yb&#8208;BTC MOFs and their upconversion luminescence and energy&#8208;transfer mechanisms were studied. These MOFs show excellent potential for optical information storage.







Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) have versatile luminescence properties, however it is challenging to achieve lanthanide&#8208;based upconversion luminescence in these materials. Here, 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC) and trivalent Yb3+ ions were used to generate crystalline Yb&#8208;BTC MOF 1D&#8208;microrods with upconversion luminescence under near infrared excitation via cooperative luminescence. Subsequently, the Yb&#8208;BTC MOFs were doped with a variety of different lanthanides to evaluate the potential for Yb3+&#8208;based upconversion and energy transfer. Yb&#8208;BTC MOFs doped with Er3+, Ho3+, Tb3+, and Eu3+ ions exhibit both the cooperative luminescence from Yb3+ and the characteristic emission bands of these ions under 980&#8197;nm irradiation. In contrast, only the 497&#8197;nm upconversion emission band from Yb3+ is observed in the MOFs doped with Tm3+, Pr3+, Sm3+, and Dy3+. The effects of different dopants on the efficiency of cooperative luminescence were established and will provide guidance for the exploitation of Ln&#8208;MOFs exhibiting upconversion.

         <title>Design of a Fully Non&#8208;Fused Bulk Heterojunction toward Efficient and Low&#8208;Cost Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of a strong polar substituent on a non&#8208;fused acceptor core can help to reduce donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8201;:&#8201;A) miscibility, leading to optimized D&#8201;:&#8201;A morphology and domain purity in fully non&#8208;fused organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Using this approach, high&#8208;efficient and stable OPV cells are achieved.







Abstract
To modulate the miscibility between donor and acceptor materials both possessing fully non&#8208;fused ring structures, a series of electron acceptors (A4T&#8208;16, A4T&#8208;31 and A4T&#8208;32) with different polar functional substituents were synthesized and investigated. The three acceptors show good planarity, high conformational stability, complementary absorption and energy levels with the non&#8208;fused polymer donor (PTVT&#8208;BT). Among them, A4T&#8208;32 possesses the strongest polar functional group and shows the highest surface energy, which facilitates morphological modulation in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blend. Benefiting from the proper morphology control method, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of approaching 16.0&#8201;% and a superior fill factor over 0.795 are achieved in the PTVT&#8208;BT&#8201;:&#8201;A4T&#8208;32&#8208;based organic photovoltaic cells with superior photoactive materials price advantage, which represent the highest value for the cells based on the non&#8208;fused blend films. Notably, this cell maintains &#8776;84&#8201;% of its initial PCE after nearly 2000&#8197;h under the continuous simulated 1&#8208;sun&#8208;illumination. In addition, the flexible PTVT&#8208;BT&#8201;:&#8201;A4T&#8208;32&#8208;based cells were fabricated and delivered a decent PCE of 14.6&#8201;%. This work provides an effective molecular design strategy for the non&#8208;fused non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) from the aspect of bulk morphology control in fully non&#8208;fused BHJ layers, which is crucial for their practical applications.

Benefiting from the proper morphology control method, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of approaching 16.0&#8201;% and a superior fill factor over 0.795 are achieved in the PTVT-BT&#8201;:&#8201;A4T-32-based organic photovoltaic cells with superior photoactive materials price advantage, which represent the highest value for the cells based on the non-fused blend films. Notably, this cell maintains &#8776;84&#8201;% of its initial PCE after nearly 2000&#8197;h under the continuous simulated 1-sun-illumination. In addition, the flexible PTVT-BT&#8201;:&#8201;A4T-32-based cells were fabricated and delivered a decent PCE of 14.6&#8201;%. This work provides an effective molecular design strategy for the non-fused non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) from the aspect of bulk morphology control in fully non-fused BHJ layers, which is crucial for their practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Branch&#8208; and Z&#8208;Selective Allylic C&#8722;H Amination with Aromatic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed branch&#8208; and Z&#8208;selective allylic C&#8722;H amination from 1,4&#8208;dienes and aromatic amines has been established for the efficient synthesis of thermodynamically unstable Z&#8208;allylamines. In addition, more basic aliphatic cyclic amines also smoothly engage in the allylic C&#8722;H amination reaction without any Lewis acid additive, preferentially giving linear&#8208;selective allylamines as the major regioisomers.







Abstract
Allylamines are important building blocks in the synthesis of bioactive compounds. The direct coupling of allylic C&#8722;H bonds and commonly available amines is a major synthetic challenge. An allylic C&#8722;H amination of 1,4&#8208;dienes has been accomplished by palladium catalysis. With aromatic amines, branch&#8208;selective allylic aminations are favored to generate thermodynamically unstable Z&#8208;allylamines. In addition, more basic aliphatic cyclic amines can also engage in the reaction, but linear dienyl allylic amines are the major products.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Single Crystals and Nanocrystal Films as Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using focused near&#8208;infrared laser trapping, bromide&#8208;iodide perovskite heterojunctions are prepared by local anion exchange reactions in methylammonium lead bromide perovskite microcrystals or nanocrystal thin films. The resulting donor&#8208;acceptor double and multi&#8208;heterojunctions efficiently transport and trap photogenerated carriers. This method offers a route to heterojunction fabrication in single crystals for solar cells and LEDs.







Abstract
Halide perovskites are materials for future optical displays and solar cells. Electron donor&#8208;acceptor perovskite heterostructures with distinguishing halide compositions are promising for transporting and harvesting photogenerated charge carriers. Combined e&#8208;beam lithography and anion exchange are promising to develop such heterostructures but challenging to prepare multiple heterojunctions at desired locations in single crystals. We demonstrate swift laser trapping&#8208;assisted band gap engineering at the desired locations in MAPbBr3 microrods, microplates, or nanocrystal thin films. The built&#8208;in donor&#8208;acceptor double and multi&#8208;heterojunction structures let us transport and trap photogenerated charge carriers from wide&#8208;band gap bromide to narrow&#8208;band gap iodide domains. We discuss the charge carrier transport and trapping mechanisms from the viewpoints of engineered bands and band continuity. This work offers a convenient method for designing single&#8208;, double&#8208; and multi&#8208;heterojunction donor&#8208;acceptor halide perovskites for photovoltaic, photonic, and electronic applications.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenative Desulfurization of Thioamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first manganese&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desulfurization of thioamides was developed to selectively cleave the C=S bond. Remarkably, functional groups such as aldehyde, ketone, sulfone, or even nitro could be unprecedentedly tolerated in this manganese&#8208;based protocol and this, despite their sensitivity to reductive conditions.







Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal catalysis has emerged as an important alternative to noble transition metal catalysis in hydrogenation reactions. However, there has been no Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal catalyzed hydrogenation of thioamides reported so far, presumably due to the poisoning of catalysts by sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Herein, we described the first manganese&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desulfurization of thioamides to amines or imines. The key to success is the use of MnBr(CO)5 instead of commonly&#8208;employed pincer&#8208;manganese catalysts, together with simple NEt3 and CuBr. This protocol features excellent selectivity on sole cleavage of the C=S bond of thioamides, in contrast to the only known Ru&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of thioamides, and unprecedented chemo&#8208;selectivity tolerating vulnerable functional groups such as nitrile, ketone, aldehyde, ester, sulfone, nitro, olefin, alkyne and heterocycle, which are usually susceptible to common hydride&#8208;type reductive protocols.

Optoelectronic properties are effectively fine&#8208;tuned via chemical modifications for different electronic functions.

Abstract
Synthetically versatile electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;electron systems are urgently needed for organic electronics, yet their design and synthesis are challenging due to the low reactivity from large electron affinities. In this work, we report a benzo[de]isoquinolino[1,8&#8208;gh]quinoline diamide (BQQDA) &#960;&#8208;electron system. The electron&#8208;rich condensed amide as opposed to the generally&#8208;employed imide provides a suitable electronic feature for chemical versatility to tailor the BQQDA &#960;&#8208;electron system for various electronic applications. We demonstrate an effective synthetic method to furnish the target BQQDA parent structure, and highly selective functionalization can be performed on bay positions of the &#960;&#8208;skeleton. In addition, thionation of BQQDA can be accomplished under mild conditions. Fine&#8208;tuning of fundamental properties and supramolecular packing motifs are achieved via chemical modifications, and the cyanated BQQDA organic semiconductor demonstrates a high air&#8208;stable electron&#8208;carrier mobility.

         <title>Protoglobin&#8208;Catalyzed Formation of cis&#8208;Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Substituted Cyclopropanes by Carbene Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protoglobins were engineered to catalyze stereodivergent cyclopropanation to afford a variety of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes using trifluorodiazoethane as the trifluoromethyl&#8208;carbene precursor.







Abstract
Trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes (CF3&#8208;CPAs) constitute an important class of compounds for drug discovery. While several methods have been developed for synthesis of trans&#8208;CF3&#8208;CPAs, stereoselective production of corresponding cis&#8208;diastereomers remains a formidable challenge. We report a biocatalyst for diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective synthesis of cis&#8208;CF3&#8208;CPAs with activity on a variety of alkenes. We found that an engineered protoglobin from Aeropyrnum pernix (ApePgb) can catalyze this unusual reaction at preparative scale with low&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yield (6&#8211;55&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (17&#8211;99&#8201;% ee), depending on the substrate. Computational studies revealed that the steric environment in the active site of the protoglobin forced iron&#8208;carbenoid and substrates to adopt a pro&#8208;cis near&#8208;attack conformation. This work demonstrates the capability of enzyme catalysts to tackle challenging chemistry problems and provides a powerful means to expand the structural diversity of CF3&#8208;CPAs for drug discovery.

We found that an engineered protoglobin from &lt;i&gt;Aeropyrnum pernix&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Ape&lt;/i&gt;Pgb) can catalyze this unusual reaction at preparative scale with low-to-excellent yield (6&#8211;55&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (17&#8211;99&#8201;% ee), depending on the substrate. Computational studies revealed that the steric environment in the active site of the protoglobin forced iron-carbenoid and substrates to adopt a pro-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; near-attack conformation. This work demonstrates the capability of enzyme catalysts to tackle challenging chemistry problems and provides a powerful means to expand the structural diversity of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CPAs for drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charge Density Overcomes Steric Hindrance of Ferrocene Surfactant in Switchable Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Dispersion Emulsions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double head ferrocene surfactant (Fc+N+C12) can stabilize switchable oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions in combination with positively charged alumina nanoparticles. Not only can reversible formation/destabilization of oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions be achieved by redox reactions, but also reversible transformation between oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions and Pickering emulsions can be achieved by pH trigger.







Abstract
A ferrocene surfactant can be switched between single and double head form (FcN+C12/Fc+N+C12) triggered by redox reaction. FcN+C12 can neither stabilize an O/W emulsion alone nor an oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsion in combination with alumina nanoparticles due to the steric hindrance of the ferrocene group. However, such steric hindrance can be overcome by increasing the charge density in Fc+N+C12, so that oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions can be co&#8208;stabilized by Fc+N+C12 and alumina nanoparticles at very low concentrations (1&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;M (&#8776;50&#8197;ppb) and 0.001&#8197;wt&#8201;%, respectively). Not only can reversible formation/destabilization of oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions be achieved by redox reaction, but also reversible transformation between oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions and Pickering emulsions can be obtained through reversing the charge of alumina particles by adjusting the pH. The results provide a new protocol for the design of surfactants for stabilization of smart oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions.

         <dc:description>Reactive RNA probes are useful for studying and identifying RNA&#8208;binding proteins. To that end, we designed and synthesized chloroacetamide&#8208;linked 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;ATP which was a good substrate for T7 RNA polymerase in in vitro transcription assay to synthesize reactive RNA probes bearing one or several reactive modifications. Modified RNA probes reacted with thiol&#8208;containing molecules as well as with cysteine&#8208; or histidine&#8208;containing peptides to form stable covalent products. They also reacted selectively with RNA&#8208;binding proteins to form cross&#8208;linked conjugates in high conversions thanks to proximity effect. Our modified nucleotide and RNA probes are promising tools for applications in RNA (bio)conjugations or RNA proteomics.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical cell&#8208;free biosensors for antibody&#160;detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here the development of an electrochemical cell&#8208;free biosensor for antibody detection directly in complex sample matrices with high sensitivity and specificity that is particularly suitable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications. The approach is based on the use of programmable antigen&#8208;conjugated gene circuits that, upon recognition of a specific target antibody, trigger the cell&#8208;free transcription of an RNA sequence that can be consequently detected using a redox&#8208;modified probe strand immobilized to a disposable electrode. The platform couples the features of high sensitivity and specificity of cell&#8208;free systems and the strength of cost&#8208;effectiveness and possible miniaturization provided by the electrochemical detection. We demonstrate the sensitive, specific, selective, and multiplexed detection of three different antibodies, including the clinically&#8208;relevant Anti&#8208;HA antibody.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Kinetic Effects convolute Activity and Tafel Analysis for the Alkaline Oxygen Evolution Reaction on NiFeOOH Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A large variety of nickel&#8208;based catalysts has been investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. However, their reported activity, as well as Tafel slope values, vary greatly. To understand this variation, we studied electrodeposited Ni80Fe&#173;20OOH catalysts with different loadings at varying rotation rates, hydroxide concentrations; with or without sonication. We show that, at low current density (&lt; 5 mA/cm2), the Tafel slope value is ~30 mV/dec for Ni80Fe20OOH in 0.1M KOH. At higher polarization, the Tafel slope continuously increases and is dependent on rotation rate, loading, hydroxide concentration and sonication. These Tafel slope values are convoluted by non&#8208;kinetic effects, such as bubbles, potential&#8208;dependent changes in ohmic resistance and (internal) OH&#8208; gradients. As best practise, we suggest that Tafel slopes should be plotted vs. current or potential. In such a plot, it can be appreciated if there is a kinetic Tafel slope or if the observed Tafel slope is influenced by non&#8208;kinetic effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Processes of Superbase Generation in Xanthone Carboxylic Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photobase generators are species that allow the photocatalysis of various reactions, such as thiol&#8208;Michael, thiol&#8208;isocyanate, and ring&#8208;opening polymerization reactions. However, existing compounds have complex syntheses and low quantum yields. To overcome these problems, photobase generators based on the photodecarboxylation reaction were developed. We synthesized and studied the photochemistry and photophysics of two xanthone photobase, their carboxylic acid precursors, and their photoproducts to understand the photobase generation mechanism. We determined accurate quantum yields of triplet states and photobase generation. We demonstrated the effect of the intermediate radical preceding the base release. We characterized the photophysics of the photobase by femtosecond spectroscopy and showed that the photodecarboxylation process occurred from the second excited triplet state with a rate constant of 2.2 &#215; 109 s&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Programming Photodegradability into Vinylic Polymers via Radical Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporation of photolabile moieties into polymer backbone holds promise to remotely&#8208;control polymer degradation. However, suitable synthetic avenues are limited, especially for radical polymerizations. Here we report a strategy to program photodegradability into vinylic polymers by exploiting the wavelength selectivity of photocycloadditions for radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (rROP). Irradiation of coumarin terminated allylic sulfides with UVA light initiated intramolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition producing cyclic macromonomers. Subsequent RAFT&#8208;mediated rROP with methyl acrylate yielded copolymers that inherited the photoreactivity of the cyclic parent monomer. Irradiation with UVB initiated efficient photocycloreversion of the coumarin dimers, causing polymer degradation within minutes under UVB light or days under sunlight exposure. Our synthetic strategy may pave the way to insert photolabile linkages into vinylic polymers, tuning degradation for specific wavelengths.</dc:description>

         <title>A Widely Distributed Biosynthetic Cassette Is Responsible for Diverse Plant Side Chain Cross&#8208;Linked Cyclopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopeptide alkaloids are an abundant class of plant cyclopeptides with over 200 analogs described and bioactivities ranging from analgesic to antiviral. While these natural products have been known for decades, their biosynthetic basis remains unclear. Using a transcriptome&#8208;mining approach, we link the cyclopeptide alkaloids from Ceanothus americanus to dedicated RiPP precursor peptides and identify new, widely distributed split BURP peptide cyclase containing gene clusters. Guided by our bioinformatic analysis, we identify and isolate new cyclopeptides from Coffea arabica, which we named arabipeptins. Reconstitution of the enzyme activity for the BURP found in the biosynthesis of arabipeptin A validates the activity of the newly discovered split BURP peptide cyclases. These results expand our understanding of the biosynthetic pathways responsible for diverse cyclic plant peptides and suggest that these side chain cross&#8208;link modifications are widely distributed in eudicots.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Networks Stabilized High&#8208;Capacity Organic Cathode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;capacity small organic materials are plagued by their high solubility. Here we proposed constructing hydrogen bond networks (HBN) via intermolecular hydrogen bonds to suppress the solubility of active material. The illustrated 2, 7&#8208; diamino&#8208;4, 5, 9, 10&#8208;tetraone (PTO&#8208;NH2) molecule with intermolecular hydrogen (H) bond between O in &#8208;C=O and H in &#8208;NH2, which make PTO&#8208;NH2 presents transverse two&#8208;dimensional extension and longitudinal &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking structure. In&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) has tracked the reversible evolution of H&#8208;bonds, further confirming the existence of HBN structure can stabilize the intermediate 2&#8208;electron reaction state. Therefore, PTO&#8208;NH2 with HBN structure has higher active site utilization (95%), better cycle stability and rate performance. This study uncovers the H&#8208;bond effect and evolution during the electrochemical process and provides a strategy for materials design.</dc:description>

         <title>Turn&#8208;on Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Indium Chlorides by 5s2 Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing chirality into the metal&#8208;halide hybrids has enabled many emerging properties including chiroptical activity, spin&#8208;dependent transport, and ferroelectricity. However, most of the chiral metal&#8208;halide hybrids to date are non&#8208;emissive, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show a new strategy to turn on the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chiral metal&#8208;halide hybrids. We demonstrate that alloying Sb3+ into chiral indium&#8208;chloride hybrids dramatically increases the photoluminescence quantum yield in two new series of chiral indium&#8208;antimony chlorides. These materials exhibit strong CPL signals with tunable energy and a high dissymmetry factor up to 1.5&#215;10&#8208;2. Mechanistic studies reveal that the emission originates from the self&#8208;trapped excitons centered in 5s2 Sb3+. Moreover, near&#8208;ultraviolet pumped white light is demonstrated with a polarization up to 6.0%. Our work demonstrates new strategies towards highly luminescent chiral metal&#8208;halide hybrids.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Stable, Capacity Dense Carboxylate Viologen Anolyte towards Long&#8208;Duration Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) have received increasing attention as an emergent battery technology for grid&#8208;scale renewable energy storage. However, physicochemical properties of redox&#8208;active organic electrolytes remain fine refinement to maximize their performance in RFBs. Herein, we report a carboxylate functionalized viologen derivative, N, N&#8217;&#8208;dibutyrate&#8208;4,4'&#8208;bipyridinium,&#160;(CBu)2V, as a highly stable, high capacity anolyte material under near pH neutral conditions.&#160;(CBu)2V&#160;can achieve more than 2.1 M solubility and display a reversible, kinetically fast reduction at &#8208;0.43 V vs NHE at pH 9.&#160;DFT studies revealed that the high solubility of&#160;(CBu)2V&#160;is attributed to its high molecular polarity while its negative reduction potential is benefitted from electron&#8208;donating carboxylate groups. A 0.89 V (CBu)2V/(NH)4Fe(CN)6&#160;AORFB demonstrated exceptional energy storage performance, specifically, 100% capacity retention with a utilized energy density of 9.5 Wh/L for 1000 cycles, power densities of up to 85 mW/cm2, and an energy efficiency of 70% at 60 mA/cm2.&#160;(CBu)2V&#160;not only represents the most capacity dense viologen with pendant ionic groups and also exhibits the longest (1200 hours or 50 days), most stable flow battery performance to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Anomalously Large Antiphase Signals from Hyperpolarized Orthohydrogen Using a MOF&#8208;Based SABRE Catalyst.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperpolarized orthohydrogen (  o  &#8208;H  2  ) is a frequent product of parahydrogen&#8208;based hyperpolarization approaches like signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE), where the hyperpolarized  o  &#8208;H  2  signal is usually absorptive. We describe a novel manifestation of this effect wherein large antiphase  o  &#8208;H  2  signals are observed, with  1  H enhancements up to ~500&#8208;fold (effective  P  H  ~1.6%). This anomalous effect is attained only when using an intact heterogeneous catalyst constructed using a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) and is qualitatively independent of substrate nature. This seemingly paradoxical observation is analogous to the &#8220;partial negative line&#8221; (PNL) effect recently explained in the context of Parahydrogen Induced Polarization (PHIP) by Ivanov and co&#8208;workers. The two&#8208;spin order of the  o  &#8208;H  2  resonance is manifested by a two&#8208;fold higher Rabi frequency, and the lifetime of the antiphase HP  o  &#8208;H  2  resonance is extended by several&#8208;fold.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>(deuterium&#8208;labeled) CF2H&#8208; and CFH2&#8208;moieties are of high interest in drug discovery. The high demand for the incorporation of these fluoroalkyl moieties into molecular structures has witnessed significant synthetic progress, particularly in the (deutero)hydrodefluorination of CF3&#8208;containing compounds. However, the controllable replacement of fluorine atoms while maintaining high chemoselectivity remains challenging. Herein, we describe the development of a selective (deutero)hydrodefluorination reaction via electrolysis. The reaction exhibits a remarkable chemoselectivity control, which is enabled by the addition of different organoboron sources. The procedure is operationally simple and scalable, and provides access in one step to high&#8208;value building blocks for application in medicinal chemistry. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out to investigate the reaction mechanism and to rationalize the chemoselectivity observed.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rigidly planar polycyclic phosphacycles featuring an internal dioxaphosphorane are promising photofunctional materials. However, the lack of efficient synthetic methods resulted in limited structural diversities which significantly hampered extensive study. Herein, we report a straightforward three&#8208;component synthesis of novel dioxaphosphorane&#8208;fused diphosphacycles with distinctive photophysical properties. Control experiments and theory calculations were performed to account for a plausible reaction mechanism. We also systematically investigated the structure&#8208;property relationships of these unprecedented platforms by combining experiments (X&#8208;ray analysis, optical and redox properties) and theoretical computations. Based on their unique structure and properties, a novel fluorescent switch for pH sensing was revealed by a dynamic ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing process.</dc:description>

Based on their unique structure and properties, a novel fluorescent switch for pH sensing was revealed by a dynamic ring-opening/ring-closing process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneous Harvesting of Multiple Hot&#8208;Holes via Visible Light Excitation of Plasmonic Gold Nanospheres for a Selective Oxidative Bond Scission of Olefins to Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, using visible photoexcitation of gold nanospheres we successfully demonstrate the simultaneous harvesting of plasmon&#8208;induced multiple hot holes in the complete oxidative scission of C=C bond in styrene at room temperature to selectively form benzaldehyde and formaldehyde, a reaction that requires multi&#8208;substrate activation. Our results reveal that while extraction of hot holes becomes efficient for interband excitation, multiple hot holes harvesting from the excited Au nanospheres becomes prevalent only beyond a threshold light intensity. We show that the alkene oxidation proceeded via a sequence of two consecutive elementary steps, namely, a binding step and a cyclic oxometallate transition state as the rate&#8208;determining step. This demonstration of plasmon excitation&#8208;mediated harvesting of multiple hot holes without the use of extra hole transport media opens exciting possibilities, notably for difficult catalytic transformations involving multi&#8208;electron oxidation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Complex LiOH&#8208;Based Cathode Chemistry in Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex LiOH chemistry is studied using combined experimental methods with ab initio calculations. During discharge, LiOH formation proceeds via 4&#8201;e&#8722; O2 reduction. During charge, LiOH oxidation proceeds via 1&#8201;e&#8722; oxidation to form OH*, followed by water oxidation and proton formation that leads to high&#8208;potential discharge plateau at subsequent cycles.







Abstract
The LiOH&#8208;based cathode chemistry has demonstrated potential for high&#8208;energy Li&#8722;O2 batteries. However, the understanding of such complex chemistry remains incomplete. Herein, we use the combined experimental methods with ab initio calculations to study LiOH chemistry. We provide a unified reaction mechanism for LiOH formation during discharge via net 4&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction, in which Li2O2 acts as intermediate in low water&#8208;content electrolyte but LiHO2 as intermediate in high water&#8208;content electrolyte. Besides, LiOH decomposes via 1&#8201;e&#8722; oxidation during charge, generating surface&#8208;reactive hydroxyl species that degrade organic electrolytes and generate protons. These protons lead to early removal of LiOH, followed by a new high&#8208;potential charge plateau (1&#8201;e&#8722; water oxidation). At following cycles, these accumulated protons lead to a new high&#8208;potential discharge plateau, corresponding to water formation. Our findings shed light on understanding of 4&#8201;e&#8722; cathode chemistries in metal&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Strong Anchoring of Hydrogels through Superwetting&#8208;Assisted High&#8208;Density Interfacial Grafting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a superwetting&#8208;assisted interfacial polymerization (SAIP) strategy to fabricate strongly anchored hydrogel&#8208;solid samples by forming high&#8208;density covalent bonds. By manipulating the initiator wettability, the hydrogels prepared by the SAIP strategy exhibit a high&#8208;strength adhesion of &#8776;1.37&#8197;MPa to resist swelling destruction.







Abstract
Strong adhesion of hydrogels on solids plays an important role in stable working for various practical applications. However, current hydrogel adhesion suffers from poor interfacial bonding with solid surfaces. Here, we propose a general superwetting&#8208;assisted interfacial polymerization (SAIP) strategy to robustly anchor hydrogels onto solids by forming high&#8208;density interfacial covalent bonds. The key of our strategy is to make the initiator fully contact solid surfaces via a superwetting way for enhancing the interfacial grafting efficiency. The designed anchored hydrogels show strong bulk failure with a high breaking strength of &#8776;1.37&#8197;MPa, different from weak interfacial failure that occurs in traditional strategies. The strong interfacial adhesion greatly enhances the stability of hydrogels against swelling destruction. This work opens up new inspirations for designing strongly anchored hydrogels from an interfacial chemistry perspective.

         <title>Automated and Efficient Generation of General Molecular Aggregate Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A completely automated, efficient, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use tool for generating accurate dimers up to large aggregate structures is presented. This algorithm, termed aISS, can be applied to molecules of any size and across the periodic table, which allows combined with its high efficiency the accurate modeling of systems not possible before.







Abstract
Modeling intermolecular interactions of complex non&#8208;covalent structures is important in many areas of chemistry. To facilitate the generation of reasonable dimer, oligomer, and general aggregate geometries, we introduce an automated computational interaction site screening (aISS) workflow. This easy&#8208;to&#8208;use tool combines a genetic algorithm employing the intermolecular force&#8208;field xTB&#8208;IFF for initial search steps with the general force&#8208;field GFN&#8208;FF and the semi&#8208;empirical GFN2&#8208;xTB method for geometry optimizations. Compared with the alternative CREST program, aISS yields similar results but with computer time savings of 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude. This allows for the treatment of systems with thousands of atoms composed of elements up to radon, e.g., metal&#8208;organic complexes, or even polyhedra and zeolite cut&#8208;outs which were not accessible before. Moreover, aISS can identify reactive sites and provides options like site&#8208;directed (user&#8208;guided) screening.

         <title>Engineering Hierarchical Recognition&#8208;Mediated Senolytics for Reliable Regulation of Cellular Senescence and Anti&#8208;Atherosclerosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aptamer&#8208;senolytic molecular prodrug is developed for reliable regulation of vascular senescence through hierarchical recognition of three types of senescence&#8208;related hallmarks. It can actively target and trigger cell&#8208;specific apoptosis in senescent endothelial cells caused by various stimuli, while keeping silent in non&#8208;senescent cells, contributing to effective inhibition effects on the senescence burden&#8208;induced progress of atherosclerosis.







Abstract
Precise regulation of vascular senescence represents a far&#8208;reaching strategy to combat age&#8208;related diseases. However, the high heterogeneity of senescence, alongside the lack of targeting and potent senolytics, makes it very challenging. Here we report a molecular design to tackle this challenge through multidimensional, hierarchical recognition of three hallmarks commonly shared among senescence, namely, aptamer&#8208;mediated recognition of a membrane marker for active cell targeting, a self&#8208;immolative linker responsive to lysosomal enzymes for switchable drug release, and a compound against antiapoptotic signaling for clearance. Such senolytic can target and trigger severe cell apoptosis in broad&#8208;spectrum senescent endothelial cells, and importantly, distinguish them from the quiescent state. Its potential for in vivo treatment of vascular diseases is successfully illustrated in a model of atherosclerosis, with effective suppression of the plaque progression yet negligible side effects.

Metal nanoclusters (MNCs)&#8208;based spin valves are fabricated and 1.6&#8201;% magnetoresistance value is achieved even at room temperature. The atomic structure regulated spin transport property of MNCs has been fully explored.







Abstract
As a new type of inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid semiconductor, quantum&#8208;confined atomically precise metal nanoclusters (MNCs) have been widely applied in the fields of chemical sensing, optical imaging, biomedicine and catalysis. Herein, we successfully design and fabricate the first example of MNC&#8208;based spin valves (SVs) that exhibit remarkable magnetoresistance (MR) value up to 1.6&#8201;% even at room temperature (300&#8197;K). The concomitant photoresponse of MNC&#8208;based SVs unambiguously confirms that the spin&#8208;polarized electron transmission takes place across the MNC interlayer. Furthermore, the spin&#8208;dependent transport property of MNC&#8208;based SVs is largely varied by changing the atomic structure of MNCs. Both experimental proofs and quantum chemistry calculations reveal that the atomic structure&#8208;discriminative spin transport behavior is attributed to the distinct spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect of MNCs.

         <title>Catalytic Living Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization Using Vinyl Ethers as Effective Chain&#8208;Transfer Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalytic polymerization mechanism (relying on a regioselective Fischer to Fischer&#8208;carbene exchange) is used to prepare living and degradable ring opening metathesis polymers in one pot. This method also allowed us to synthesize ROMP&#8208;ROMP, ROMP&#8208;ATRP, PEG&#8208;ROMP diblock copolymers with controlled molecular weights and narrow dispersities using sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of costly and toxic ruthenium catalyst quite straightforwardly.







Abstract
A catalytic living ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization (ROMP) method is described that relies on a degenerative, reversible and regioselective exchange of propagating Fischer&#8208;carbenes. All characteristics of a living polymerization such as narrow dispersity, excellent molar mass control and the ability to form block copolymers are achieved by this method. The method allows the use of up to 200&#8197;times less ruthenium complex than traditional living ROMP. We demonstrate the synthesis of ROMP&#8208;ROMP diblock copolymers, ATRP from a ROMP macro&#8208;initiator and living ROMP from a PEG&#8208;based macro chain transfer agent. The cost&#8208;effective, sustainable and environmentally friendly synthesis of degradable polymers and block copolymers enabled by this strategy will find various applications in biomedicine, materials science, and technology.

         <title>Energy Transport in Dichroic Metallo&#8208;organic Crystals: Selective Inclusion of Spatially Resolved Arrays of Donor and Acceptor Dyes in Different Nanochannels
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between arrays of donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores in a metal&#8211;organic framework has been observed. These arrays of aligned chromophores have been formed by size&#8208;selective inclusion in differently nanosized channels, resulting in micro&#8208;sized crystals with anisotropic optical properties.







Abstract
In this study, the precise positioning and alignment of arrays of two different guest molecules in a crystalline host matrix has been engineered and resulted in new optically active materials. Sub&#8208;nm differences in the diameters of two types of 1D channels are sufficient for size&#8208;selective inclusion of dyes. Energy transport occurs between the arrays of different dyes that are included in parallel&#8208;positioned nanochannels by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The color of individual micro&#8208;sized crystals are dependent on their relative position under polarized light. This angular&#8208;dependent behavior is a result of the geometrically constrained orientation of the dyes by the crystallographic packing of the host matrix and is concentration dependent.

         <title>Transformable Plasmonic Helix with Swinging Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a transformable plasmonic helix, in which multiple AuNPs can programmable move around a shared DNA origami shaft. To enable the translocations of multiple AuNPs in large leaps without detachment, the AuNPs are guided by DNA swingarms extended from the origami to target positions through sequence&#8208;specific DNA interactions.







Abstract
Control over multiple optical elements that can be dynamically rearranged to yield substantial three&#8208;dimensional structural transformations is of great importance to realize reconfigurable plasmonic nanoarchitectures with sensitive and distinct optical feedback. In this work, we demonstrate a transformable plasmonic helix system, in which multiple gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be directly transported by DNA swingarms to target positions without undergoing consecutive stepwise movements. The swingarms allow for programmable AuNP translocations in large leaps within plasmonic nanoarchitectures, giving rise to tailored circular dichroism spectra. Our work provides an instructive bottom&#8208;up solution to building complex dynamic plasmonic systems, which can exhibit prominent optical responses through cooperative rearrangements of the constituent optical elements with high fidelity and programmability.

         <title>Selective Lanthanide&#8208;Organic Catalyzed Depolymerization of Nylon&#8208;6 to &#1013;&#8208;Caprolactam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commercial and post&#8208;consumer Nylon&#8208;6 are selectively recycled to the &#1013;&#8208;caprolactam monomer in high yields by readily accessible lanthanide tris(amide) catalysts in a solvent&#8208;free process. Catalytic activity scales with the lanthanide ionic radius. A chain&#8208;end backbiting mechanism is proposed from experimental and theoretical analyses.







Abstract
Nylon&#8208;6 is selectively depolymerized to the parent monomer &#1013;&#8208;caprolactam by the readily accessible and commercially available lanthanide trisamido catalysts Ln(N(TMS)2)3 (Ln=lanthanide). The depolymerization process is solvent&#8208;free, near quantitative, highly selective, and operates at the lowest Nylon&#8208;6 to &#1013;&#8208;caprolactam depolymerization temperature reported to date. The catalytic activity of the different lanthanide trisamides scales with the Ln3+ ionic radius, and this process is effective with post&#8208;consumer Nylon&#8208;6 as well as with Nylon&#8208;6+polyethylene, polypropylene or polyethylene terephthalate mixtures. Experimental kinetic data and theoretical (DFT) mechanistic analyses suggest initial deprotonation of a Nylon terminal amido N&#8722;H bond, which covalently binds the catalyst to the polymer, followed by a chain&#8208;end back&#8208;biting process in which &#1013;&#8208;caprolactam units are sequentially extruded from the chain end.

         <title>Plasmonic Silver&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Catalysed Hydrogen Abstraction from the C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond of the Benzylic C&#945; atom for Cleavage of Alkyl Aryl Ether Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intense electromagnetic near&#8208;field and hot electrons of illuminated plasmonic metal nanoparticles enable hydrogen abstraction from the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of the C&#945; atom of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages. The cleavage of unreactive ether C&#946;&#8722;O bonds is facilitated to produce aromatic compounds with unsaturated double bonds.







Abstract
Selective activation of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond is an important process in organic synthesis, where efficiently activating a specific C(sp3)&#8722;H bond without causing side reactions remains one of chemistry's great challenges. Here we report that illuminated plasmonic silver metal nanoparticles (NPs) can abstract hydrogen from the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of the C&#945; atom of an alkyl aryl ether &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage. The intense electromagnetic near&#8208;field generated at the illuminated plasmonic NPs promotes chemisorption of the &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 compound and the transfer of photo&#8208;generated hot electrons from the NPs to the adsorbed molecules leads to hydrogen abstraction and direct cleavage of the unreactive ether C&#946;&#8722;O bond under moderate reaction conditions (&#8776;90&#8201;&#176;C). The plasmon&#8208;driven process has certain exceptional features: enabling hydrogen abstraction from a specific C(sp3)&#8722;H bond, along with precise scission of the targeted C&#8722;O bond to form aromatic compounds containing unsaturated, substituted groups in excellent yields.

The intense electromagnetic near-field generated at the illuminated plasmonic NPs promotes chemisorption of the &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-O-4 compound and the transfer of photo-generated hot electrons from the NPs to the adsorbed molecules leads to hydrogen abstraction and direct cleavage of the unreactive ether C&lt;sub&gt;&#946;&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;O bond under moderate reaction conditions (&#8776;90&#8201;&#176;C). The plasmon-driven process has certain exceptional features: enabling hydrogen abstraction from a specific C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond, along with precise scission of the targeted C&#8722;O bond to form aromatic compounds containing unsaturated, substituted groups in excellent yields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Up/Down Tuning of Poly(ionic liquid)s in Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel responsive aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPSs) comprising Azo&#8208; and benzyl (Bn)&#8208;modified poly(ionic liquid)s were fabricated, whose upper and lower phases could be adjusted using the grafting degree of the Azo and Bn groups. Thermally induced up/down tuning of poly(ionic liquid)s in ATPSs was achieved for the first time in this study.







Abstract
Thermally induced reversible up/down migration of poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) in aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPSs) was achieved for the first time in this study. Novel ATPSs were fabricated using azobenzene (Azo)&#8208; and benzyl (Bn)&#8208;modified PILs, and their upper and lower phases could be easily tuned using the grafting degree (GD) of the Azo and Bn groups. Bn&#8208;PIL with higher GDBn could go up into the upper phase and Azo&#8208;PIL come down to the lower phase when the temperature increased (&gt;65&#8201;&#176;C); this behavior was reversed at lower temperatures. Moreover, a reversible two&#8208;phase/single&#8208;phase transition was realized under UV irradiation. Experimental and simulation results revealed that the difference in the hydration capacity between Bn&#8208;PIL and Azo&#8208;PIL accounted for their unique phase&#8208;separation behavior. A versatile platform for fabricating ATPSs with tunable stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior can be realized based on our findings, which can broaden their applications in the fields of smart separation systems and functional material development.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Nickel Anchored on a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon/TiO2 Composite for Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic CH4 Oxidation to Oxygenates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically dispersed Ni&#8722;NC/TiO2 photocatalyst was designed for direct CH4 oxidation with O2 to oxygenates. Single&#8208;atom Ni&#8722;NC sites not only promote the carrier separation to facilitate CH4 conversion, but also enhance the activation of O2 to &#8901;OOH radicals, thereby leading to a substantial enhancement in activity and selectivity to oxygenates.







Abstract
Direct photocatalytic oxidation of methane to liquid oxygenated products is a sustainable strategy for methane valorization at room temperature. However, in this reaction, noble metals are generally needed to function as cocatalysts for obtaining adequate activity and selectivity. Here, we report atomically dispersed nickel anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon/TiO2 composite (Ni&#8722;NC/TiO2) as a highly active and selective catalyst for photooxidation of CH4 to C1 oxygenates with O2 as the only oxidant. Ni&#8722;NC/TiO2 exhibits a yield of C1 oxygenates of 198&#8197;&#956;mol for 4&#8197;h with a selectivity of 93&#8201;%, exceeding that of most reported high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggest that the single&#8208;atom Ni&#8722;NC sites not only enhance the transfer of photogenerated electrons from TiO2 to isolated Ni atoms but also dominantly facilitate the activation of O2 to form the key intermediate &#8901;OOH radicals, which synergistically lead to a substantial enhancement in both activity and selectivity.

         <title>Mitigating Electron Leakage of Solid Electrolyte Interface for Stable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have given insights into the electron leakage behavior that underlies the distinct SEI growth, by investigating the specific SEI component type/distribution in detail. The uniform SEI layer with favorable component and distribution is found out to have both the low electron driving force and the high electron insulation. Therefore, the electron leakage causing SEI growth is largely restrained.







Abstract
The interfacial stability is highly responsible for the longevity and safety of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, the continuous solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase(SEI) growth would deteriorate its stability. Essentially, the SEI growth is associated with the electron leakage behavior, yet few efforts have tried to suppress the SEI growth, from the perspective of mitigating electron leakage. Herein, we built two kinds of SEI layers with distinct growth behaviors, via the additive strategy. The SEI physicochemical features (morphology and componential information) and SEI electronic properties (LUMO level, band gap, electron work function) were investigated elaborately. Experimental and calculational analyses showed that, the SEI layer with suppressed growth delivers both the low electron driving force and the high electron insulation ability. Thus, the electron leakage is mitigated, which restrains the continuous SEI growth, and favors the interface stability with enhanced electrochemical performance.

High&#8208;performance electrode based on earth&#8208;abundant elements synthesized simply in the presence of H2O2, enabling the selective electrooxidation of many organic molecules to value&#8208;added products at industrial current densities.







Abstract
Hydrogen generated in electrolyzers is discussed as a key element in future energy scenarios, but oxygen evolution as the standard anode reaction is a complex multi&#8208;step reaction requiring a high overpotential. At the same time,it does not add value&#8208;the oxygen is typically released into the atmosphere. Alternative anode reactions which can proceed at similar current densities as the hydrogen evolution are, therefore, of highest interest. We have discovered a high&#8208;performance electrode based on earth&#8208;abundant elements synthesized in the presence of H2O2, which is able to sustain current densities of close to 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the oxidation of many organic molecules, which are partly needed at high production volumes. Such anode reactions could generate additional revenue streams, which help to solve one of the most important problems in the transition to renewable energy systems, i.e. the cost of hydrogen electrolysis.

         <title>Co&#8208;La&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Transporting Layers for Binary Organic Solar Cells with 18.82&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processed Co&#8208;La&#8208;based hole transporting layers were developed for organic solar cells with high power conversion efficiency (18.82&#8201;%), superior reproductivity and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a widely used hole transporting layer (HTL) in organic solar cells (OSCs), but its acidity severely reduces the stability of devices. Until now, very few HTLs were developed to replace PEDOT:PSS toward stable and high&#8208;performance OSCs. Herein, a new cobalt&#8208;lanthanum (Co&#8208;La) inorganic system was reported as HTL to show a high conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.82&#8201;%, which is among the top PCEs in binary OSCs. Since electron&#8208;rich outer shell of La atom can interact with Co atom to form charge transfer complex, the work function and conductivity of the Co&#8208;La system could be simultaneously enhanced compared to Co or La&#8208;based HTLs. This Co&#8208;La system could also be applied into other OSCs to show high performance. All these results demonstrate that binary Co&#8208;La systems as HTL can efficiently tackle the issue in hole transporting and show powerful application in OSCs to replace PEDOT:PSS.

&lt;p&gt;Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a widely used hole transporting layer (HTL) in organic solar cells (OSCs), but its acidity severely reduces the stability of devices. Until now, very few HTLs were developed to replace PEDOT:PSS toward stable and high-performance OSCs. Herein, a new cobalt-lanthanum (Co-La) inorganic system was reported as HTL to show a high conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.82&#8201;%, which is among the top PCEs in binary OSCs. Since electron-rich outer shell of La atom can interact with Co atom to form charge transfer complex, the work function and conductivity of the Co-La system could be simultaneously enhanced compared to Co or La-based HTLs. This Co-La system could also be applied into other OSCs to show high performance. All these results demonstrate that binary Co-La systems as HTL can efficiently tackle the issue in hole transporting and show powerful application in OSCs to replace PEDOT:PSS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Layered &#946;&#8208;ZrNBr Nitro&#8208;Halide as Multifunctional Photocatalyst for Water Splitting and CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitro&#8208;nitride &#946;&#8208;ZrNBr featuring broad visible&#8208;light absorption, high thermal stability, and low defect concentration is revealed as a multifunctional photocatalyst for effective water reduction, water oxidation and CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Developing mixed&#8208;anion semiconductors for solar fuel production has inspired extensive interest, but the nitrohalide&#8208;based photocatalyst is still in shortage. Here we report a layered nitro&#8208;halide &#946;&#8208;ZrNBr with a narrow band gap of ca. 2.3&#8197;eV and low defect density to exhibit multifunctionalities for photocatalytic water reduction, water oxidation and CO2 reduction under visible&#8208;light irradiation. As confirmed by the results of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the formation of anion vacancies in the nitro&#8208;halide photocatalyst was inhibited due to its relatively high formation energy. Furthermore, performance of &#946;&#8208;ZrNBr can be effectively promoted by a simple exfoliation into nanosheets to shorten the carrier transfer distance as well as to promote charge separation. Our work extends the territory of functional photocatalysts into the nitro&#8208;halide, which opens a new avenue for fabricating efficient artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Stable Luminescent [Cu(NN)(PP)]+ Complexes Incorporating a &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Diphosphane Ligand with Metal&#8208;Confining Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented Smiles&#8208;like rearrangement of diphenyl&#8208;(2&#8208;phosphanylphenyl)phosphane gives access to a &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based diphosphane that forms stable heteroleptic [Cu(NN)(PP)]+ complexes. Unfavorable flattening of the metal tetrahedral geometry in the excited state as a result of diimine encapsulation (bpy, phen, or mmp) is responsible for the enhanced luminescent properties.







Abstract
A &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based diphosphane with metal&#8208;confining properties was efficiently synthesized thanks to an unprecedented Smiles&#8208;like rearrangement of diphenyl&#8208;(2&#8208;phosphanylphenyl)phosphane in the presence of excess n&#8208;BuLi. The cis&#8208;chelating bidentate ligand is capable of forming very stable heteroleptic [Cu(NN)(PP)]+ complexes in which a metal&#8208;bound diimine ligand (bpy, phen, or mmp) is located within the cyclodextrin cavity. As a result of ligand encapsulation, flattening of the metal tetrahedral geometry in the excited state is disfavored, thereby resulting in enhanced luminescent properties.

         <title>Monolithic Phosphate Interphase for Highly Reversible and Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolithic solid electrolyte interphase was constructed to boost the long&#8208;term cycling of zinc metal anode via a hybrid non&#8208;aqueous/aqueous electrolyte strategy. The interphase exhibits a simple composition (Zn3(PO4)2 and ZnP2O6) and a highly robust structure, which could help alleviate zinc corrosion and reduce zinc dendrites formation.







Abstract
Zinc metal battery (ZMB) is promising as the next generation of energy storage system, but challenges relating to dendrites and corrosion of the zinc anode are restricting its practical application. Here, to stabilize Zn anode, we report a controlled electrolytic method for a monolithic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) via a high dipole moment solvent dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP). The DMMP&#8208;based electrolytes can generate a homogeneous and robust phosphate SEI (Zn3(PO4)2 and ZnP2O6). Benefiting from the protecting impact of this in situ monolithic SEI, the zinc electrode exhibits long&#8208;term cycling of 4700&#8197;h and a high Coulombic efficiency 99.89&#8201;% in Zn|Zn and Zn|Cu cell, respectively. The full V2O5|Zn battery with DMMP&#8208;H2O hybrid electrolyte exhibits a high capacity retention of 82.2&#8201;% following 4000 cycles under 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The first success in constructing the monolithic phosphate SEI will open a new avenue in electrolyte design for highly reversible and stable Zn metal anodes.

         <title>Manipulating OH&#8722;&#8208;Mediated Anode&#8208;Cathode Cross&#8208;Communication Toward Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Vanadium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative concept of manipulating anode&#8208;cathode interplay for cycling durability improvement is demonstrated by employing Al2(SO4)3 as electrolyte additive. The suppression of OH&#8722;&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;communication between Zn and NVO by Al2(SO4)3 simultaneously stabilize the two electrodes, even under ultra&#8208;acidic environment (pH&#8776;0.9). The as&#8208;assembled Zn||NVO batteries exhibit satisfactory lifespan at both low and high scan rates.







Abstract
The anode&#8208;cathode interplay is an important but rarely considered factor that initiates the degradation of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, to address the limited cyclability issue of V&#8208;based AZIBs, Al2(SO4)3 is proposed as decent electrolyte additive to manipulate OH&#8722;&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;communication between Zn anode and NaV3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O (NVO) cathode. The hydrolysis of Al3+ creates a pH&#8776;0.9 strong acidic environment, which unexpectedly prolongs the anode lifespan from 200 to 1000&#8197;h. Such impressive improvement is assigned to the alleviation of interfacial OH&#8722; accumulation by Al3+ adsorption and solid electrolyte interphase formation. Accordingly, the strongly acidified electrolyte, associated with the sedated crossover of anodic OH&#8722; toward NVO, remarkably mitigate its undesired dissolution and phase transition. The interrupted OH&#8722;&#8208;mediated communication between the two electrodes endows Zn||NVO batteries with superb cycling stability, at both low and high scan rates.

         <title>Nine&#8208;Electron Transfer of Binder Synergistic &#960;&#8208;d Conjugated Coordination Polymers as High&#8208;Performance Lithium Storage Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#960;&#8208;D conjugated coordination polymer Ni&#8208;DHBQ exhibits an ultra&#8208;high lithium storage capacity of 9&#8208;electron transfer and excellent rate performance due to its multiple redox active centers, &#960;&#8208;d conjugation and laminar structure. Meanwhile, the binder CMC, like an octopus, has an appropriate interaction with both the ligand and Ni2+ of Ni&#8208;DHBQ, thus reducing the solubility of Ni&#8208;DHBQ and enhancing its cycle life.







Abstract
To solve the problems such as the dissolution and the poor conductivity of organic small molecule electrode materials, we construct &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination polymer Ni&#8208;DHBQ with multiple redox&#8208;active centers as lithium storage materials. It exhibits an ultra&#8208;high capacity of 9&#8208;electron transfers, while the &#960;&#8208;d conjugation and the laminar structure inside the crystal ensure fast electron transport and lithium ion diffusion, resulting in excellent rate performance (505.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles). The interaction of Ni&#8208;DHBQ with the binder CMC synergistically inhibits its dissolution and anchors the Ni atoms, thus exhibiting excellent cycling stability (650.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100&#8197;cycles). This work provides insight into the mechanism of lithium storage in &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination polymers and the synergistic effect of CMC, which will contribute to the molecular design and commercial application of organic electrode materials.

     alt="Nine-Electron Transfer of Binder Synergistic &#960;-d Conjugated Coordination Polymers as High-Performance Lithium Storage Materials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#960;-D conjugated coordination polymer Ni-DHBQ exhibits an ultra-high lithium storage capacity of 9-electron transfer and excellent rate performance due to its multiple redox active centers, &#960;-d conjugation and laminar structure. Meanwhile, the binder CMC, like an octopus, has an appropriate interaction with both the ligand and Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; of Ni-DHBQ, thus reducing the solubility of Ni-DHBQ and enhancing its cycle life.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Identifying the Interfacial Polarization in Non&#8208;stoichiometric Lead&#8208;Free Perovskites by Defect Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances in perovskite ferroelectrics have fostered a host of exciting sensors and actuators. Defect engineering provides critical control of the performance of ferroelectric materials, especially lead&#8208;free ones. However, it remains a challenge to quantitatively study the concentration of defects due to the complexity of measurement techniques. Here, a feasible approach to analyzing the A&#8208;site defect and electron in alkali metal niobate is demonstrated. The theoretical relationships among defect concentration, conductivity, and oxygen partial pressure can be established based on the defect chemistry equilibria. The type and concentration of defects are reflected through the conductivity variation with oxygen partial pressure. As a result, the variation of defect concentration gives rise to defect&#8208;driven interfacial polarization, which further leads to distinct properties of the ceramics. e.g., abnormal dielectric behavior. Furthermore, this study also suggests a strategy to manipulate defects and charges in perovskite oxides for performance optimization.</dc:description>

The unconventional mechanism of reaction is supported by theoretical calculations, which first produces diphenyl&#173;methane and unexpectedly 1&#8208;(6&#8208;methylenecyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienyl)benzene intermediates (C13H12) accessed via addition of the phenyl radical to the ortho position of the benzyl radical. These findings offer convincing evidence for molecular mass growth processes defying conventional wisdom that radical&#8211;radical reactions are initiated through recombination at their radical centers.

         <title>Optimizing Acetylene Sorption through Induced&#8208;fit Transformations in a Chemically Stable Microporous Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing practical storage technologies for acetylene (C2H2) is important but challenging because C2H2 is useful but explosive. Here, a novel metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) (FJI&#8208;H36) with adaptive channels was prepared. It can effectively capture C2H2 (159.9 cm3cm&#8208;3) at 1 atm and 298 K, possessing a record&#8208;high storage density (561 gL&#8208;1) but a very low adsorption enthalpy (28 kJmol&#8208;1) among all the reported MOFs. Structural analyses show that such excellent adsorption performance comes from the synergism of active sites, flexible framework, and matched pores; where the adsorbed&#8208;C2H2 can drive FJI&#8208;H36 to undergo induced&#8208;fit transformations step by step, including deformation/reconstruction of channels, contraction of pores, and transformation of active sites, finally leading to dense packing of C2H2. Moreover, FJI&#8208;H36 has excellent chemical stability and recyclability, and can be prepared on a large scale, enabling it as a practical adsorbent for C2H2. This will provide a useful strategy for developing practical and efficient adsorbents for C2H2 storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Stiffness&#8208;Transformable Nanoplatforms Responsive to the Tumor Microenvironment for Enhanced Tumor Therapeutic Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report, for the first time, a unique stiffness&#8208;transformable manganese oxide hybridized mesoporous organosilica nanoplatform (MMON) for enhancing tumor therapeutic efficacy. The prepared MMONs had a quasi&#8208;spherical morphology and were completely transformed into soft bowl&#8208;like nanocapsules in the simulated tumor microenvironment through the breakage of Mn&#8208;O bonds, which decreased their Young&#8217;s modulus from 165.7 to 84.5 MPa. Due to their unique stiffness transformation properties, the MMONs had reduced macrophage internalization, improved tumor cell uptake, and enhanced penetration of multicellular spheroids. In addition, in vivo experiments showed that the MMONs displayed a 3.79&#8208; and 2.90&#8208;fold decrease in non&#8208;specific liver distribution and a 2.87&#8208; and 1.83&#8208;fold increase in tumor accumulation compared to their soft and stiff counterparts, respectively. Furthermore, chlorin e6 (Ce6) modified MMONs had significantly improved photodynamic therapeutic effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Third Generation Sequencing of Epigenetic DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of epigenetic bases has revolutionised the understanding of disease and development. Among the most studied epigenetic marks are cytosines covalently modified at the 5 position. In order to gain insight into their biological significance, the ability to determine their spatiotemporal distribution within the genome is essential. Techniques for sequencing on &#8216;Next Generation&#8217; platforms often involve harsh chemical treatments leading to sample degradation. Third generation sequencing promises to further revolutionise the field by providing long reads, enabling coverage of highly repetitive regions of the genome or structural variants considered unmappable by next generation sequencing technology. While the ability of third generation platforms to directly detect epigenetic modifications is continuously improving, at present chemical or enzymatic derivatisation presents the most convenient means of enhancing reliability. This review presents techniques available for the detection of cytosine modifications on third generation platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>The Alarmone Diadenosine Tetraphosphate as a Cosubstrate for Protein AMPylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diadenosine polyphosphates (ApnAs) are non&#8208;canonical nucleotides whose cellular concentrations increase during stress and are therefore termed alarmones, signaling homeostatic imbalance. Their cellular role is poorly understood. In this work, we assessed ApnAs for their usage as cosubstrate for protein AMPylation, a post&#8208;translational modification in which adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is transferred to proteins. In humans, AMPylation mediated by the AMPylator FICD with ATP as cosubstrate is a response to ER stress. Here, we demonstrate that Ap4A is proficiently consumed for AMPylation by FICD. By chemical proteomics using a new chemical probe, we identified new potential AMPylation targets. Interestingly, we found that AMPylation targets of FICD may differ depending on the nucleotide cosubstrate. These results may suggest that signaling at elevated Ap4A levels during cellular stress differs from when Ap4A is present at low concentrations allowing response to extracellular cues.</dc:description>

         <title>Structurally Diverse Bench&#8208;Stable Nickel(0) Pre&#8208;Catalysts: A Practical Toolkit for In Situ Ligation Protocols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A flurry of recent research has centered on harnessing the power of nickel catalysis in organic synthesis. These efforts have been bolstered by contemporaneous development of well&#8208;defined nickel (pre)catalysts with diverse structure and reactivity. In this report, we present ten different bench&#8208;stable, 18&#8208;electron, formally zero&#8208;valent nickel&#8211;olefin complexes that are competent pre&#8208;catalysts in various reactions. Our investigation includes preparations of novel, bench stable Ni(COD)(L) complexes (COD = 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene), in which L = quinone, cyclopentadienone, thiophene&#8208;S&#8208;oxide, and fulvene. Characterization by NMR, IR, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and natural bond orbital analysis sheds light on the structure, bonding, and properties of these complexes. Applications in an assortment of nickel&#8208;catalyzed reactions underscore the complementary nature of the different pre&#8208;catalysts within this toolkit.</dc:description>

         <title>Swelling&#8208;induced Mechanochromism in Multinetwork Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel and versatile approach to achieving swelling&#8208;induced mechanochemistry using a multinetwork (MN) strategy that enables polymer networks to repeatedly swell with monomers and solvents. The isotropic expansion of the first network (FN) provides sufficient force to drive the mechanochemical scission of a radical&#8208;based mechanophore, difluorenylsuccinonitrile (DFSN). Although prompt recombination generally occurs in such highly mobile environments, the resulting pink radicals are kinetically stabilized in the gels, probably due to limited diffusion in the extended polymer chains. Moreover, the DFSN embedded in the isotropically strained chain exhibits increased thermal reactivity, which can be reasonably explained by an entropic contribution of the FN to the dissociation. The utility of the MN polymers is demonstrated not only in terms of swelling&#8208;force&#8208;induced network modification, but also in the context of tunable reactivity of the dissociative unit through proper design of the hierarchical network architecture.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Phonon Energies in Lanthanide&#8208;doped Potassium Lead Halide Nanocrystals for Enhanced Nonlinearity and Upconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop phonon&#8208;engineered, lanthanide&#8208;doped upconverting nanoparticles with the lowest phonon energies available to date. Low&#8208;phonon&#8208;energy KPb2X5 (X=Cl, Br) upconverting nanoparticles exhibit dramatically suppressed multiphonon relaxation, enhancing upconversion emission from higher lanthanide excited states and enabling the first room&#8208;temperature observation of avalanche&#8208;like upconversion by Nd3+ ions.







Abstract
Optical applications of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles require materials with low phonon energies to minimize nonradiative relaxation and promote nonlinear processes like upconversion. Heavy halide hosts offer low phonon energies but are challenging to synthesize as nanocrystals. Here, we demonstrate the size&#8208;controlled synthesis of low&#8208;phonon&#8208;energy KPb2X5 (X=Cl, Br) nanoparticles and the ability to tune nanocrystal phonon energies as low as 128&#8197;cm&#8722;1. KPb2Cl5 nanoparticles are moisture resistant and can be efficiently doped with lighter lanthanides. The low phonon energies of KPb2X5 nanoparticles promote upconversion luminescence from higher lanthanide excited states and enable highly nonlinear, avalanche&#8208;like emission from KPb2Cl5&#8201;:&#8201;Nd3+ nanoparticles. The realization of nanoparticles with tunable, ultra&#8208;low phonon energies facilitates the discovery of nanomaterials with phonon&#8208;dependent properties, precisely engineered for applications in nanoscale imaging, sensing, luminescence thermometry and energy conversion.

         <title>Sustainable Conversion of Microplastics to Methane with Ultrahigh Selectivity by a Biotic&#8211;Abiotic Hybrid Photocatalytic System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methanogen&#8208;semiconductor biohybrids drive sustainable conversion of microplastics to CH4 under illumination. This addresses a long&#8208;standing challenge of photocatalysis by fully utilizing photogenerated electrons and holes without the need of using expensive and unsustainable chemical sacrificial quenchers.







Abstract
Efficient conversion of microplastics into fuels provides a promising strategy to alleviate environmental pollution and the energy crisis. However, the conventional processes are challenged by low product selectivity and potential secondary pollution. Herein, a biotic&#8208;abiotic photocatalytic system is designed by assembling Methanosarcina barkeri (M.&#8197;b) and carbon dot&#8208;functionalized polymeric carbon nitrides (CDPCN), by which biodegradable microplastics&#8212;poly(lactic acid) after heat pretreatment can be converted into CH4 for five successive 24&#8208;day cycles with nearly 100&#8201;% CH4 selectivity by the assistance of additional CO2. Mechanistic analyses showed that both photooxidation and photoreduction methanogenesis worked simultaneously via the fully utilizing photogenerated holes and electrons without chemical sacrificial quenchers. Further research validated the real&#8208;world applicability of M.&#8197;b&#8208;CDPCN for non&#8208;biodegradable microplastic&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion, offering a new avenue for engineering the plastic reuse.

         <title>Diboron(4)&#8208;Catalyzed Remote [3+2] Cycloaddition of Cyclopropanes via Dearomative/Rearomative Radical Transmission through Pyridine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previously challenging pyridinyl cyclopentanes, cyclopentenes and bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes with multiple substituents now can be efficiently prepared via a remote [3+2] cycloaddition reaction. The reaction features a simple diboron(4) catalyst, modular disconnection mode, broad scope, high atom economy and a unique dearomative/rearomative mechanistic process.







Abstract
Ring structures such as pyridine, cyclopentane or their combinations are important motifs in bioactive molecules. In contrast to previous cycloaddition reactions that necessitated a directly bonded initiating functional group, this work demonstrated a novel through&#8208;(hetero)arene radical transmission concept for selective activation of a remote bond. An efficient, metal&#8208;free and atom&#8208;economical [3+2] cycloaddition between 4&#8208;pyridinyl cyclopropanes and alkenes or alkynes has been developed for modular synthesis of pyridine&#8208;substituted cyclopentanes, cyclopentenes and bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes that are difficult to access using known methods. This complexity&#8208;building reaction was catalyzed by a very simple and inexpensive diboron(4) compound and took place via dearomative/rearomative processes. The substrate scope was broad and more than 100 new compounds were prepared in generally high yields. Mechanistic experiments and density function theory (DFT) investigation supported a radical relay catalytic cycle involving alkylidene dihydropyridine radical intermediates and boronyl radical transfer.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Triaryl &#945;&#8208;Pyranones with 1,2&#8208;Diaxes by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;step atroposelective construction of triaryl &#945;&#8208;pyranones with stereogenic 1,2&#8208;diaxes was accomplished by NHC organocatalysis. The structure of the substrates and the catalytic system play a critical role in the success of this protocol. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the origin of the high stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Atropisomers bearing multiple stereogenic axes are of increasing importance to the field of material science, pharmaceuticals, and catalysis. However, the atroposelective construction of multi&#8208;axis atropisomers remains rare and challenging, due to the intrinsical difficulties in the stereo&#8208;control of the multiple stereogenic axes. Herein, we demonstrate a single&#8208;step construction of a new class of 1,2&#8208;diaxially chiral triaryl &#945;&#8208;pyranones by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene organocatalytic asymmetric [3+3] annulation of well&#8208;designed alkynyl acylazolium precursors and enolizable sterically hindered 2&#8208;aryl ketones. The protocol features broad substrate scope (&gt;50 examples), excellent stereo&#8208;control (most cases &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, up to 99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 er), and potentially useful synthetic applications. The success of this reaction relies on the rational design of structurally matched reaction partners and the careful selection of the asymmetric catalytic system. DFT calculations have also been performed to discover and rationalize the origin of the high stereoselectivity of this reaction.

         <title>Catalytic Biosensors Operating under Quasi&#8208;Equilibrium Conditions for Mitigating the Changes in Substrate Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a catalytic quasi&#8208;equilibrium biosensor concept in which an O2&#8208;insensitive enzyme is wired with a redox polymer to the electrode. This allows the enzymatic conversion to be switched off by applying a low potential, the redox polymer can be charged with a short positive potential pulse, and the glucose concentration can be determined potentiometrically with minimal disturbance of the concentration equilibrium. This concept is opening the door for mitigating any impact of the foreign&#8208;body reaction in implantable biosensors.







Abstract
Despite the success of continuous glucose measuring systems operating through the skin for about 14&#8197;days, long&#8208;term implantable biosensors are facing challenges caused by the foreign&#8208;body reaction. We present a conceptually new strategy using catalytic enzyme&#8208;based biosensors based on a measuring sequence leading to minimum disturbance of the substrate equilibrium concentration by controlling the sensor between &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221; state combined with short potentiometric data acquisition. It is required that the enzyme activity can be completely switched off and no parasitic side reactions allow substrate turnover. This is achieved by using an O2&#8208;independent FAD&#8208;dependent glucose dehydrogenase embedded within a crosslinked redox polymer. A short measuring interval allows the glucose concentration equilibrium to be restored quickly which enables the biosensor to operate under quasi&#8208;equilibrium conditions.

         <title>Highly Efficient Green and Red Narrowband Emissive Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Employing Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters
</title>

         <dc:description>
Through careful selection of donor substituents about the DiKTa core, record&#8208;high efficiency green&#8208;emitting OLEDs were fabricated, with EQEmax of 30.8&#8201;%, and the reddest MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs have been reported based on ketone&#8208;containing multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate how judicious selection of the donor decorating a central multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) core based on DiKTa can lead to very high&#8208;performance OLEDs. By decorating the DiKTa core with triphenylamine (TPA) and diphenylamine (DPA), 3TPA&#8208;DiKTa and 3DPA&#8208;DiKTa exhibit bright, narrowband green and red emission in doped films, respectively. The OLEDs based on these emitters showed record&#8208;high performance for this family of emitters with maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax) of 30.8&#8201;% for 3TPA&#8208;DiKTa at &#955;EL of 551&#8197;nm and 16.7&#8201;% for 3DPA&#8208;DiKTa at &#955;EL=613&#8197;nm. The efficiency roll&#8208;off in the OLEDs was improved significantly by using 4CzIPN as an assistant dopant in hyperfluorescence (HF) devices. The outstanding device performance has been attributed to preferential horizontal orientation of the transition dipole moments of 3TPA&#8208;DiKTa and 3DPA&#8208;DiKTa.

         <title>Catalytically Stable Potassium Single&#8208;Atom Solid Superbases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of solid superbase derived from potassium single atoms anchored on graphene is developed by a tandem redox strategy. The source of the basicity is the single K atoms, thus differing from conventional basicity which originates from oxygen and nitrogen atoms. The high dispersion and anchoring of superbasic sites endows the catalyst with excellent activity and stability in transesterification reactions.







Abstract
Solid superbases can catalyze diverse reactions under mild conditions, while they suffer from aggregation of basic sites and poor stability during recycling. Here we report a new generation of solid superbases derived from K single atoms (SAs) prepared by a tandem redox strategy. The initial redox reaction takes place between base precursor KNO3 and graphene support, producing K2O at 400&#8201;&#176;C. Further increasing the temperature to 800&#8201;&#176;C, the graphene reduces K2O to K anchored by its vacancies, leading to the generation of K SAs (denoted as K1/G). The source of basicity in the K1/G is K SAs, and neighboring single atoms (NSAs) possess superbasicity, which is different from conventional basicity originated from oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Due to the superbasicity as well as high dispersion and anchoring of basic sites, the K1/G shows excellent catalytic activity and stability in transesterification reaction, which is much superior to the reported catalysts.

         <title>Durable Lithium Metal Anodes Enabled by Interfacial Layers Based on Mechanically Interlocked Networks Capable of Energy Dissipation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically interlocked network (MIN) with robustness and unique energy dissipation capability was used as the interfacial layer which survived and suppressed repeated Li protrusion in long&#8208;term and high&#8208;capacity cycling to afford durable lithium metal anodes. This work highlights the importance of the energy dissipation feature in stabling Li metal anodes, promising MIN's future success in other battery&#8208;related fields suffering from repeated volume variations.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has received considerable attention due to its vital role in stabilizing Li anode. However, native and many artificial SEIs often suffer from cracking and fragmentation under dendrite impact or long&#8208;term repeated volume variation, causing capacity decay. Herein, a mechanically interlocked network (MIN) was innovatively designed as interfacial layer to protect Li anode by incorporating the unique energy dissipation capability, which helps Li anode survive repeated volume variation during long&#8208;term cycling. As a result, symmetric cell with MIN&#8208;coated Li anode (MIN@Li) exhibited prolonged cycling life of 1500&#8197;hours at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The full cell using LFP cathode (13.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) cycled stably for 500 cycles with capacity retention over 88&#8201;% (1&#8197;C). Our results highlight a creative application of MIN in Li anode, and its unique energy dissipation capability promises future success in other battery fields suffering from repeated volume variations.

         <title>Suprasomes Based on Host&#8211;Guest Molecular Recognition: An Excellent Alternative to Liposomes in Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suprasomes, considered the third generation of vesicular drug delivery systems, are constructed based on host&#8211;guest recognition. Cisplatin&#8208;loaded suprasomes are promising for photothermal therapy (PTT) and laser&#8208;triggered spatiotemporally controllable drug release. Compared to liposomal nanomedicines, CDDP@Suprasomes realize complete tumor ablation without metastasis as a result of the synergy between PTT and chemotherapy, showing great potential in cancer theranostics.







Abstract
Liposomes and polymersomes, typical vesicular drug delivery systems (DDSs), have faced some limitations in cancer theranostics. Suprasomes, supramolecular vesicles assembled from amphiphiles linked by noncovalent interactions, show potential as new generation of vesicular DDSs. We construct suprasomes based on host&#8211;guest recognition, by which the desired functions can be integrated into carriers without tedious synthesis. Photothermally active host&#8211;guest complex is formed between a functional guest and pillar[5]arene, which further self&#8208;assembles into hollow suprasomes. A supramolecular nanomedicine is developed by encapsulating cisplatin in the suprasomes. The obtained cisplatin@Suprasomes achieve excellent anticancer efficacy and anti&#8208;metastasis combining chemotherapy and photothermal therapy, which ablate the tumors without relapse and metastasis. This work demonstrates the facile functionalization of suprasomes, holding promise as alternatives to liposomes and polymersomes.

         <title>A Crosslinked Ionic Organic Framework for Efficient Iodine and Iodide Remediation in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic porous organic framework (HCOF&#8208;7) has been developed to remove iodine residues (I2 and I&#8722;) after water disinfection, demonstrating high breakthrough volumes and wide working temperatures.







Abstract
Iodine is widely used as an antimicrobial reagent for water disinfection in the wilderness and outer space, but residual iodine and iodide need to be removed for health reasons. Currently, it is challenging to remove low concentrations of iodine and iodide in water (&#8776;5&#8197;ppm). Furthermore, the remediation of iodine and iodide across a broad temperature range (up to 90&#8201;&#176;C) has not previously been investigated. In this work, we report a nitrate dimer&#8208;directed synthesis of a single&#8208;crystalline ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinked organic framework (HCOF&#8208;7). HCOF&#8208;7 removes iodine and iodide species in water efficiently through halogen bonding and anion exchange, reducing the total iodine concentration to 0.22&#8197;ppm at room temperature. Packed HCOF&#8208;7 columns were employed for iodine/iodide breakthrough experiments between 23 and 90&#8201;&#176;C, and large breakthrough volumes were recorded (&#8805;18.3&#8197;L&#8201;g&#8722;1). The high iodine/iodide removal benchmarks recorded under practical conditions make HCOF&#8208;7 a promising adsorbent for water treatment.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase and Simultaneous Regulating Solvation Structures for Advanced Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional electrolyte additive, N&#8208;Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), is developed to improve the electrochemical performance of Zn anodes. NMP not only alters the solvation structure of Zn2+, but also in situ produces a dense nitrogen&#8208;rich layer on Zn. This layer protects Zn from corrosive electrolytes and benefits the uniform plating/stripping of Zn.







Abstract
Zn metal as one of promising anode materials for aqueous batteries suffers from notorious dendrite growth, serious Zn corrosion and hydrogen evolution. Here, a bifunctional electrolyte additive, N&#8208;methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), is developed to improve the electrochemical performance of Zn anode. NMP not only alters the solvation structure of Zn2+, but also in situ produces a dense N&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase layer on Zn foils. This layer protects Zn foils from corrosive electrolytes and benefits the uniform plating/stripping of Zn. Hence, the asymmetrical cells with NMP in the electrolyte retain a high coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% over 1000&#8197;cycles. The symmetric cells survive &#8776;200&#8197;h for 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a high Zn utilization of 85.6&#8201;%.

&lt;p&gt;A bifunctional electrolyte additive, N-Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), is developed to improve the electrochemical performance of Zn anodes. NMP not only alters the solvation structure of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, but also in situ produces a dense nitrogen-rich layer on Zn. This layer protects Zn from corrosive electrolytes and benefits the uniform plating/stripping of Zn.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zn metal as one of promising anode materials for aqueous batteries suffers from notorious dendrite growth, serious Zn corrosion and hydrogen evolution. Here, a bifunctional electrolyte additive, N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), is developed to improve the electrochemical performance of Zn anode. NMP not only alters the solvation structure of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, but also in situ produces a dense N-rich solid-electrolyte-interphase layer on Zn foils. This layer protects Zn foils from corrosive electrolytes and benefits the uniform plating/stripping of Zn. Hence, the asymmetrical cells with NMP in the electrolyte retain a high coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% over 1000&#8197;cycles. The symmetric cells survive &#8776;200&#8197;h for 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a high Zn utilization of 85.6&#8201;%. The full cells of Zn||MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; show an impressive cumulative capacity even with lean electrolyte (E/C ratio=10&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mAh&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), limited Zn supply (N/P ratio=2.3) and high areal capacity (5.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Anionic Chemistry in Regulating the Reductive Stability of Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The participation of anions in the solvation sheath of lithium ions promotes the reductive stability of solvents. Simultaneously, anions themselves tend to get reduced more easily and induce the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, which is beneficial to stabilizing lithium metal anodes.







Abstract
Advanced electrolyte design is essential for building high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium (Li) batteries, and introducing anions into the Li+ solvation sheaths has been widely demonstrated as a promising strategy. However, a fundamental understanding of the critical role of anions in such electrolytes is very lacking. Herein, the anionic chemistry in regulating the electrolyte structure and stability is probed by combining computational and experimental approaches. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, the solvents and anions in Li+ solvation sheaths exhibit enhanced and decreased reductive stability compared with free counterparts, respectively, which agrees with both calculated and experimental results of reduction potentials. Accordingly, new strategies are proposed to build stable electrolytes based on the established anionic chemistry. This work unveils the mysterious anionic chemistry in regulating the structure&#8211;function relationship of electrolytes and contributes to a rational design of advanced electrolytes for practical Li metal batteries.

This work develops exo&#8208;olefin compounds (R&#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Z) as chain&#8208;transfer agents for the sulfur&#8208;free RAFT polymerization of methacrylates in homogeneous solution. A series of R&#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Z with the MMA&#8208;dimer structure as R and substituted &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene unit as &#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Z (Z: Ph&#8722;Y) were synthesized. More electron&#8208;donating substituents (Y) work better. Colorless sulfur&#8208;free multiblock copolymers were prepared via sequential monomer additions.







Abstract
In this work, the development of exo&#8208;olefin compounds (R&#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Z) as chain&#8208;transfer agents for the sulfur&#8208;free reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) radical polymerization of methacrylates in homogeneous solution is described. A series of exo&#8208;olefin compounds with a methyl methacrylate (MMA) dimer structure as the R group and a substituted &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene unit as the &#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Z (Z: Ph&#8722;Y) group were synthesized and used for the radical polymerization of MMA in toluene and PhC(CF3)2OH. These compounds underwent transfer of the CH2C(=CH2)Z group via addition&#8208;fragmentation of the propagating methacryloyl radical. More electron&#8208;donating (Y) substituents, such as methoxy and dimethylamino groups, produced polymers with narrower molecular weight distributions. A continuous monomer addition method further improved molecular weight control and enabled the synthesis of colorless, sulfur&#8208;free, multiblock copolymers of methacrylates in homogeneous solutions.

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Computational Design of &#969;&#8208;Transaminase by Reprograming of High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Barrier Steps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanism&#8208;guided computational enzyme design was used to reprogram the transition states and ground states of key steps in the asymmetric reductive amination of indanones. The common features of three high&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier steps responsible for low catalytic efficiency were revealed by quantum mechanics and guided subsequent enzyme design. The best mutant exhibited a significant improvement in catalytic efficiency towards various prochiral indanones.







Abstract
&#969;&#8208;Transaminases (&#969;&#8208;TAs) show considerable potential for the synthesis of chiral amines. However, their low catalytic efficiency towards bulky substrates limits their application, and complicated catalytic mechanisms prevent precise enzyme design. Herein, we address this challenge using a mechanism&#8208;guided computational enzyme design strategy by reprograming the transition and ground states in key reaction steps. The common features among the three high&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier steps responsible for the low catalytic efficiency were revealed using quantum mechanics (QM). Five key residues were simultaneously tailored to stabilize the rate&#8208;limiting transition state with the aid of the Rosetta design. The 14 top&#8208;ranked variants showed 16.9&#8211;143&#8208;fold improved catalytic activity. The catalytic efficiency of the best variant, M9 (Q25F/M60W/W64F/I266A), was significantly increased, with a 1660&#8208;fold increase in kcat/Km and a 1.5&#8211;26.8&#8208;fold increase in turnover number (TON) towards various indanone derivatives.

The formal thermal para&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H propargylation of C4&#8208;unsubstituted naphthyl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers through para&#8208;Claisen rearrangement was described, and chirality transfer was observed. Moreover, the enantioselective dearomatization of C4&#8208;substituted substrates was realized by using a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/CoII complex catalyst. The DFT calculations and experimental results support the ortho&#8208;Claisen rearrangement/Cope rearrangement sequence process.







Abstract
The para&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of aryl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers involves two&#8208;step [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangements and dearomatization process, which has high activation barriers and is of challenge. Here we discovered thermal para&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of naphthyl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers, and it enabled the formation of formal para&#8208;C&#8722;H propargylation products upon rearomatization. Chirality transfer occurred if optically active propargyl ethers were employed, leading to the construction of aryl/propargyl&#8208;containing stereogenic centers. Moreover, catalytic asymmetric dearomatization of naphthyl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers with different substitution at para&#8208;position gave access to benzocyclohexenones bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. The reaction was accelerated by a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/Co(OTf)2 complex catalyst to achieve high yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and high enantioselectivities (up to 93&#8201;% ee). The DFT calculations and experimental results provided important clues to clarify the para&#8208;Claisen rearrangement process as well as the chiral induction and remote delivery.

Chirality transfer occurred if optically active propargyl ethers were employed, leading to the construction of aryl/propargyl-containing stereogenic centers. Moreover, catalytic asymmetric dearomatization of naphthyl 1-propargyl ethers with different substitution at &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-position gave access to benzocyclohexenones bearing all-carbon quaternary stereocenters. The reaction was accelerated by a chiral &lt;i&gt;N,N&#8242;&lt;/i&gt;-dioxide/Co(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex catalyst to achieve high yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and high enantioselectivities (up to 93&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). The DFT calculations and experimental results provided important clues to clarify the &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-Claisen rearrangement process as well as the chiral induction and remote delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dithiol&#8208;Activated Bioorthogonal Chemistry for Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8208;Targeted Synergistic Chemophototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal chemistry is introduced for design of organic nitrite donors, on the basis of SNAr and cyclization reactions between dithiols and 5&#8208;nitrobenzo[c][2,1,3]thiadiazole derivatives. A combination of &#8220;click to release&#8221; strategy and photoactivation is achievable for cancer chemophototherapy.







Abstract
The controlled intracellular release of nitrite is still an unmet challenge due to the lack of bio&#8208;friendly donors, and the antitumor effect of nitrite is limited by its physiologically inert activity. Herein, we designed benzothiadiazole&#8208;based organic nitrite donors that are stable against bio&#8208;relevant species but selectively respond to dithiol species through SNAr/intramolecular cyclization tandem reactions in the aqueous media. The bioorthogonal system was established to target the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of liver cancer HepG2 cells. The nitrite and nonivamide were coupled to induce elevation of intracellular levels of calcium ions as well as reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, which resulted in ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. We demonstrated that a combination of photoactivation and &#8220;click to release&#8221; strategy could enhance antitumor effect in cellular level and show good potential for cancer precision therapy.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Fluorinated Solvation Shell and Low Salt Concentration Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;concentration electrolyte was employed in high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries. The synergistic effects of fluorinated solvation shell and low salt concentration generated robust and LiF&#8208;rich SEI and fewer unfavorable decomposition products. The excellent performance implies that the optimization of low concentration electrolytes is a successful solution for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale electrolyte designs.







Abstract
Concentration of electrolyte has significant effects on performances of rechargeable batteries. Previous studies mainly focused on concentrated electrolytes. So far, only several recipes on low&#8208;concentration electrolytes were studied, performing enhanced performance in advanced rechargeable batteries. Here, based on common electrolyte components, a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte composed of 0.2&#8197;M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) solvated in fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) is employed for high&#8208;voltage Li metal battery. The synergistic working mechanisms of introducing fluorine&#8208;containing solvent in the solvated structure and low salt concentration effect are revealed, resulting in LiF&#8208;rich, uniform, and robust solid electrolyte interphase layer and fewer unfavorable decomposition products. As a result, this low&#8208;concentration electrolyte significantly enhances electrochemical performances of Li||Li symmetric cells and high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2||Li batteries.

         <title>Near&#8208;Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetoelectric Coupling via Spin Crossover in an Iron(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetoelectric coupling is achieved near room temperature in a spin crossover FeII molecule&#8208;based compound. The coupling is realized through the interplay of structural, magnetic, and electrical changes that allows the spin crossover to be driven by a remarkably low magnetic field of 3&#8197;T.







Abstract
Magnetoelectric coupling is achieved near room temperature in a spin crossover FeII molecule&#8208;based compound, [Fe(1bpp)2](BF4)2. Large atomic displacements resulting from Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions induce a change in the molecule dipole moment when switching between high&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin states leading to a step&#8208;wise change in the electric polarization and dielectric constant. For temperatures in the region of bistability, the changes in magnetic and electrical properties are induced with a remarkably low magnetic field of 3&#8197;T. This result represents a successful expansion of magnetoelectric spin crossovers towards ambient conditions. Moreover, the observed 0.3&#8211;0.4&#8197;mC&#8201;m&#8722;2 changes in the H&#8208;induced electric polarization suggest that the high strength of the coupling obtained via this route is accessible not just at cryogenic temperatures but also near room temperature, a feature that is especially appealing in the light of practical applications.

         <title>Fabricating Industry&#8208;Compatible Olefin&#8208;Linked COF Resins for Oxoanion Pollutant Scavenging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral and ionic vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were constructed with inexpensive 2,4,6&#8208;collidine as the building unit by a melt polymerization method. The as&#8208;prepared, low&#8208;cost cationic COF foams showed high crystallinity, abundant porosity, superior stability, and high adsorption capacity for oxoanion pollutants. This study opens a pathway to large&#8208;scale industrial production of ionic COFs.







Abstract
Large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to meet the demands of industrial application remains formidably challenge. Here we report using 2,4,6&#8208;collidine as monomer to produce a series of highly crystalline olefin&#8208;linked COFs by a melt polymerization method. This method enables the kilogram&#8208;scale fabrication of self&#8208;shaped monolithic robust foams. The afforded COFs possess extremely low cost (&lt;50&#8197;USD/kg), superior to all the reported COFs. Furthermore, using one&#8208;pot or post&#8208;modification methods can conveniently transform neutral COFs to ionic COFs, which can be applied as highly efficient ion&#8208;exchange sorbents for scavenging oxoanion pollutants. Remarkably, the superior adsorption capacity of a model oxoanion (ReO4&#8722;) is the highest among crystalline porous materials reported so far. This work not only expands the scopes of olefin&#8208;linked COFs but also enlightens the route for the industrial production of crystalline ion exchange sorbents.

         <title>Precisely Tailoring Heterometallic Polyoxotitanium Clusters for the Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterometallic cocrystal Ti4Fe1 cluster is prepared by incorporating Fe species into a polyoxotitanium cluster. The cocrystal Ti4Fe1 cluster enables both C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation by photogenerated holes and further reactions by singlet oxygen. As a result Ti4Fe1 has higher activity and selectivity in the photocatalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons than the Fe&#8208;doped Ti3Fe1 cluster.







Abstract
Photocatalysis is a promising yet challenging approach for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons to valuable oxygenated chemicals with O2 under mild conditions. In this work, we report an atomically precise material model to address this challenge. The key to our solution is the rational incorporation of Fe species into polyoxotitanium cluster to form a heterometallic Ti4Fe1 cocrystal. This newly designed cocrystal cluster, which well governs the energy and charge transfer as evidenced by spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations, enables the synergistic process involving C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation by photogenerated holes and further reactions by singlet oxygen (1O2). Remarkably, the cocrystal Ti4Fe1 cluster achieves efficient and selective oxidation of hydrocarbons (C5 to C16) into aldehydes and ketones with a conversion rate up to 12&#8201;860&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, 5 times higher than that of Fe&#8208;doped Ti3Fe1 cluster. This work provides insights into photocatalyst design at atomic level enabling synergistic catalysis.

         <title>2D Hexagonal Assemblies of Amphiphilic Double&#8208;Helical Poly(phenylacetylene) Homopolymers with Enhanced Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique assembly strategy has been developed to generate free&#8208;standing two&#8208;dimensional chiral nanomaterials based on amphiphilic poly(phenylacetylene) homopolymers, which bear hydrophobic and hydrophilic dendritic side chains and adopt a DNA&#8208;like double&#8208;helical conformation. The aggregates form modulable 2D hexagonal nanosheets directly in solution, with enhanced CPL and chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) chiral materials have been attracting immense attentions owing to their unique properties. Herein, we successfully developed a unique assembly strategy of amphiphilic homopolymers to construct stable free&#8208;standing 2D chiral nanosheets in solution. The amphiphilic poly(phenylacetylene) (PPA) homopolymers bearing the hydrophobic and hydrophilic dendritic side chains adopt a DNA&#8208;like double&#8208;helical conformation. The regular hexagonal nanosheets were formed in THF/EtOH through nucleation and epitaxial growth. The sizes of the nanosheets can be modulated from nanometers to submillimeters upon varying the ratio of binary solvents, while the thickness is linearly correlated with the molecular weights. The 2D architecture can significantly enhance the CPL of polymers with a high dissymmetry factor &#8776;0.1. Driven by a discrimination of helical conformation, the PPAs can self&#8208;sort into homochiral 2D nanosheets, as directly visualized by using fluorescent microscopy.

         <title>A General Method to Edit Histone H3 Modifications on Chromatin Via Sortase&#8208;Mediated Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sortase&#8208;based method of histone H3 tail editing on chromatin is reported. Histone H3 tail peptides with cell&#8208;penetrating sequence can be metathesized to histone H3 for multivalent modifications on chromatin and influence epigenetics. This described sortase mediated metathesis strategy could be broadly applied to edit endogenous proteins in live cells.







Abstract
The post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) on the tail of histone H3 control chromatin structure and influence epigenetics and gene expression. The current chemical methods including unnatural amino acid incorporation and protein splicing enable preparations of the histone with diverse PTMs in cellular contexts, but they are not applicable to edit native chromatin. The manipulation of histone&#8208;modifying enzymes alter the endogenous histone PTMs but the lack of specificity of most histone&#8208;modifying enzymes prevents precise control of specific H3 tail PTM patterns. Here we report a new method to edit the N&#8208;tail of histone H3 via sortase mediated metathesis (SMM). The sortase can install desired PTM patterns into histone H3 on nucleosomes in vitro and in cellulo. This study expands the application scope of sortase from ligation to metathesis in live cells using cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs). In addition, it offers a strategy to edit PTMs of cellular histone H3 with potential for the development of precise epigenome editing.

         <title>An RNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Structure within the ADAR 5&#8242;UTR Interacts with DHX36 Helicase to Regulate Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (rG4) structure was identified in the 5&#8242;UTR of the ADAR1 mRNA using multi&#8208;disciplinary assays in vitro and cells. The binding and resolving effect of rG4&#8208;specific helicase DHX36 on this rG4 was monitored using G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;triggered fluorogenic hybridization (GTFH) probe. Functionally, ADAR1 5&#8242;UTR rG4 inhibits reporter gene and native transcript translation with DHX36 modulating its formation in cells.







Abstract
RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (rG4) structures in the 5&#8242; untranslated region (5&#8242;UTR) play crucial roles in fundamental cellular processes. ADAR is an important enzyme that binds to double&#8208;strand RNA and accounts for the conversion of Adenosine to Inosine in RNA editing. However, so far there is no report on the formation and regulatory role of rG4 on ADAR expression. Here, we identify and characterize a thermostable rG4 structure within the 5&#8242;UTR of the ADAR1 mRNA and demonstrate its formation and inhibitory role on translation in reporter gene and native gene constructs. We reveal rG4&#8208;specific helicase DHX36 interacts with this rG4 in vitro and in cells under knockdown and knockout conditions by GTFH (G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;triggered fluorogenic hybridization) probes and modulates translation in an rG4&#8208;dependent manner. Our results further substantiate the rG4 structure&#8208;DHX36 protein interaction in cells and highlight rG4 to be a key player in controlling ADAR1 translation.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Triggered Synthetic Nanopore for Controlling Molecular Transport Across Biological Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic light&#8208;gated nanopore controls transport of molecules across bilayer membranes. The pore self&#8208;assembles from seven DNA strands including one lid strand carrying light&#8208;switchable azobenzene chromophores. The gated pore may be used for research, biosensing, and targeted drug release.







Abstract
Controlling biological molecular processes with light is of interest in biological research and biomedicine, as light allows precise and selective activation in a non&#8208;invasive and non&#8208;toxic manner. A molecular process benefitting from light control is the transport of cargo across biological membranes, which is conventionally achieved by membrane&#8208;puncturing barrel&#8208;shaped nanopores. Yet, there is also considerable gain in constructing more complex gated pores. Here, we pioneer a synthetic light&#8208;gated nanostructure which regulates transport across membranes via a controllable lid. The light&#8208;triggered nanopore is self&#8208;assembled from six pore&#8208;forming DNA strands and a lid strand carrying light&#8208;switchable azobenzene molecules. Exposure to light opens the pore to allow small&#8208;molecule transport across membranes. Our light&#8208;triggered pore advances biomimetic chemistry and DNA nanotechnology and may be used in biotechnology, biosensing, targeted drug release, or synthetic cells.

         <title>Revealing the High Salt Concentration Manipulated Evolution Mechanism on the Lithium Anode in Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical processes at the Li anode/electrolyte interface are disclosed in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with high salt concentration via in&#8208;situ atomic force microscopy and optical microscopy. The 3D morphology, local mechanics, and ion conductivity of the on&#8208;site formed solid electrolyte interphase are in&#8208;situ measured and analyzed to reveal the regulation effect of high salt concentration on interfacial electrochemistry.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are promising candidates of energy storage devices. Both adjusting salt/solvent ratio and applying quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes are regarded as effective strategies to improve the lithium (Li) anode performance. However, reaction mechanisms and interfacial properties in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur (QSSLS) batteries with high salt concentration are not clear. Here we utilize in&#8208;situ characterizations and molecular dynamics simulations to unravel aforesaid mysteries, and construct relationships of electrolyte structure, interfacial behaviour and performance. The generation mechanism, formation process, and mechanical/chemical/electrochemical properties of the anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are deeply explored. Li deposition uniformity and dissolution reversibility are further tuned by the sustainable SEI. These straightforward evidences and deepgoing studies would guide the electrolyte design and interfacial engineering of QSSLS batteries.

         <title>Biocatalytic Thionation of Epoxides for Enantioselective Synthesis of Thiiranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocatalytic thionation method is presented for the enantioselective synthesis of thiiranes from epoxides by a halohydrin dehalogenase catalyzed kinetic resolution approach using thiocyanate as a sulfur donor. Various chiral thiiranes bearing aryl and alkyl substituents were synthesized in good yields and enantioselectivities by using recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing the engineered halohydrin dehalogenase HHDHapb variants.







Abstract
Expanding the enzymatic toolbox for the green synthesis of valuable molecules is still of high interest in synthetic chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry. Chiral thiiranes are valuable sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds, but relevant methods for their enantioselective synthesis are limited. Herein, we report a biocatalytic thionation strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of thiiranes, which was developed based on the halohydrin dehalogenase (HHDH)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective ring&#8208;opening reaction of epoxides with thiocyanate and a subsequent nonenzymatic rearrangement process. A novel HHDH was identified and engineered for enantioselective biocatalytic thionation of various aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted epoxides on a preparative scale, affording the corresponding thiiranes in up to 43&#8201;% isolated yield and 98&#8201;% ee. Large&#8208;scale synthesis and useful transformations of chiral thiiranes were also performed to demonstrate the utility and scalability of the biocatalytic thionation strategy.

         <title>Thiamyxins: Structure and Biosynthesis of Myxobacterial RNA&#8208;Virus Inhibitors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical structure and absolute stereochemistry of an unprecedented natural product family, the thiamyxins, is presented. These thiazole&#8208; and thiazoline&#8208;containing cyclic depsipeptides are produced by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#8208;polyketide synthase hybrid biosynthetic gene cluster, whose structure is described herein. The thiamyxins were found to exhibit promising antiviral activity against three different RNA viruses.







Abstract
During our search for novel myxobacterial natural products, we discovered the thiamyxins: thiazole&#8208; and thiazoline&#8208;rich non&#8208;ribosomal peptide&#8208;polyketide hybrids with potent antiviral activity. We isolated four congeners of this unprecedented natural product family with the non&#8208;cyclized thiamyxin&#8197;D fused to a glycerol unit at the C&#8208;terminus. Alongside their structure elucidation, we present a concise biosynthesis model based on biosynthetic gene cluster analysis and isotopically labelled precursor feeding. We report incorporation of a 2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylpent&#8208;3&#8208;enoic acid moiety by a GCN5&#8208;related N&#8208;acetyltransferase&#8208;like decarboxylase domain featuring polyketide synthase. The thiamyxins show potent inhibition of RNA viruses in cell culture models of corona, zika and dengue virus infection. Their potency up to a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 560&#8197;nM combined with milder cytotoxic effects on human cell lines indicate the potential for further development of the thiamyxins.

         <title>An Atom&#8208;Pair Design Strategy for Optimizing the Synergistic Electron Effects of Catalytic Sites in NO Selective Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactant adsorption and surface reactions are two key steps in heterogeneous catalysis but the simultaneous optimization of these two variables remains challenging. These two key steps were optimized concomitantly in a model reaction&#8212;NO selective reduction&#8212;by designing a series of atom&#8208;pair active sites with a strong electronic synergy.







Abstract
Effective adsorption and speedy surface reactions are vital requirements for efficient active sites in catalysis, but it remains challenging to maximize these two functions simultaneously. We present a solution to this issue by designing a series of atom&#8208;pair catalytic sites with tunable electronic interactions. As a case study, NO selective reduction occurring on V1&#8722;W1/TiO2 is chosen. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the synergistic electron effect present between the paired atoms enriches high&#8208;energy spin charge around the Fermi level, simultaneously rendering reactant (NH3 or O2) adsorption more effective and subsequent surface reactions speedier as compared with single V or W atom alone, and hence higher reaction rates. This strategy enables us to rationally design a high&#8208;performance V1&#8722;Mo1/TiO2 catalyst with optimized vanadium(IV)&#8208;molybdenum(V) electronic interactions, which has exceptional activity significantly higher than the commercial or reported catalysts.

         <title>Enhanced Acidic Water Oxidation by Dynamic Migration of Oxygen Species at the Ir/Nb2O5&#8722;x Catalyst/Support Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic migration of oxygen species between oxide support and Ir catalyst during OER is uncovered. These migrations not only regulate the in situ Ir catalytic structure towards boosted activity, but also suppress Ir over&#8208;oxidation via oxygen species transference, thereby ensuring overall high performance in PEM water electrolyzer.







Abstract
Catalyst/support interaction plays a vital role in catalysis towards acidic oxygen evolution (OER), and the performance reinforcement is currently interpreted by either strain or electron donation effect. We herein report that these views are insufficient, where the dynamic evolution of the interface under potential bias must be considered. Taking Nb2O5&#8722;x supported iridium (Ir/Nb2O5&#8722;x) as a model catalyst, we uncovered the dynamic migration of oxygen species between IrOx and Nb2O5&#8722;x during OER. Direct spectroscopic evidence combined with theoretical computation suggests these migrations not only regulate the in situ Ir structure towards boosted activity, but also suppress its over&#8208;oxidation via spontaneously delivering excessive oxygen from IrOx to Nb2O5&#8722;x. The optimized Ir/Nb2O5&#8722;x thus demonstrated exceptional performance in scalable water electrolyzers, i.e., only need 1.839&#8197;V to attain 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (surpassing the DOE 2025 target), and no activity decay during a 2000&#8197;h test at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

     alt="Enhanced Acidic Water Oxidation by Dynamic Migration of Oxygen Species at the Ir/Nb2O5&#8722;x Catalyst/Support Interfaces"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic migration of oxygen species between oxide support and Ir catalyst during OER is uncovered. These migrations not only regulate the in situ Ir catalytic structure towards boosted activity, but also suppress Ir over-oxidation via oxygen species transference, thereby ensuring overall high performance in PEM water electrolyzer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalyst/support interaction plays a vital role in catalysis towards acidic oxygen evolution (OER), and the performance reinforcement is currently interpreted by either strain or electron donation effect. We herein report that these views are insufficient, where the dynamic evolution of the interface under potential bias must be considered. Taking Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; supported iridium (Ir/Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;) as a model catalyst, we uncovered the dynamic migration of oxygen species between IrO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; and Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; during OER. Direct spectroscopic evidence combined with theoretical computation suggests these migrations not only regulate the in situ Ir structure towards boosted activity, but also suppress its over-oxidation via spontaneously delivering excessive oxygen from IrO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; to Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;. The optimized Ir/Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; thus demonstrated exceptional performance in scalable water electrolyzers, i.e., only need 1.839&#8197;V to attain 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (surpassing the DOE 2025 target), and no activity decay during a 2000&#8197;h test at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deaminative Arylation and Alkenyaltion of Aliphatic Tertiary Amines with Aryl and Alkenylboronic Acids via Nitrogen Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and general deaminative arylation and alkenylation of tertiary amines with aryl and alkenylboronic acids is enabled by difluorocarbene under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. This protocol represents a novel reaction mode which succeeded in the construction of Csp3&#8722;Csp2 bonds via an in situ formed nitrogen ylide from tertiary amines (propargyl amines, allyl amines and 1H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl methane amines) and difluorocarbene with aryl and alkenylboronic acids.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling has significantly advanced C&#8722;C bond formation and has been well recognized in organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, materials science and other fields. In this rapid development, cross coupling without transition metal catalyst is a big challenge in this field, and using widely existing tertiary amines as electrophiles to directly couple with boronic acids has great hurdles yet significant application prospects. Herein, we report an efficient and general deaminative arylation and alkenylation of tertiary amines (propargyl amines, allyl amines and 1H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl methane amines) with ary and alkenylboronic acids enabled by difluorocarbene under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. Preliminary mechanism experiments suggest that in situ formed difluoromethyl quaternary amine salt, nitrogen ylide and tetracoordinate boron species are the key intermediates, the subsequent 1,2&#8208;metallate shift and protodeboronation complete the new coupling reaction.

         <title>Organizing Enzymes on Self&#8208;Assembled Protein Cages for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled protein cages were functionalized to achieve spatial organization of sequential enzymes in living cells, which confer cascade reactions with optimal local concentrations and microenvironment, thereby entailing enhanced biocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Cells use self&#8208;assembled biomaterials such as lipid membranes or proteinaceous shells to coordinate thousands of reactions that simultaneously take place within crowded spaces. However, mimicking such spatial organization for synthetic applications in engineered systems remains a challenge, resulting in inferior catalytic efficiency. In this work, we show that protein cages as an ideal scaffold to organize enzymes to enhance cascade reactions both in vitro and in living cells. We demonstrate that not only enzyme&#8208;enzyme distance but also the improved Km value contribute to the enhanced reaction rate of cascade reactions. Three sequential enzymes for lycopene biosynthesis have been co&#8208;localized on the exterior of the engineered protein cages in Escherichia coli, leading to an 8.5&#8208;fold increase of lycopene production by streamlining metabolic flux towards its biosynthesis. This versatile system offers a powerful tool to achieve enzyme spatial organization for broad applications in biocatalysis.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Selective Charge Transport in Lead&#8208;Free Chiral Perovskites: The Key towards High&#8208;Anisotropy in Circularly&#8208;Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of zero&#8208;dimensional bismuth&#8208;based chiral perovskites has been introduced for the detection of circularly polarized light. The lower dimensional perovskites exhibit high degree of chirality&#8208;induced spin&#8208;selectivity allowing the transport of one type of spin&#8208;half state while blocking the other type resulting in an anisotropic current response of the photodetectors that can be used to detect the polarization state of CPL photons.







Abstract
A pair of zero&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free chiral perovskites is introduced towards the detection of circularly polarized light (CPL). Although spin&#8208;polarized carriers are generated in the perovskites under the CPL, the absorption anisotropy remained low leading to mostly similar density of photogenerated carriers under the two CPLs. Interestingly, due to the intrinsic chirality in the perovskites, they exhibited chirality&#8208;induced spin&#8208;selectivity (CISS) allowing the transport of only one type of spin&#8208;half states. A high anisotropy in photocurrent along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction has therefore appeared resulting in a spin&#8208;dependent photovoltaic effect in vertical heterojunction devices and making them suitable for CPL detection. While a self&#8208;powered CPL detector showed a limited (but one of the highest to date) anisotropy factor of 0.3 due to possible spin&#8208;flips during the transport process, the factor rose to 0.6 under bias prompting extension of the effective spin&#8208;diffusion length.

         <title>Gold(I) Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters for Highly Efficient Ultrapure&#8208;Green Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple gold(I) coordination strategy affords highly efficient narrowband green and blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence with emission quantum yields of ca. 0.9 and considerably shortened lifetimes down to 5.5&#8197;&#956;s. The resultant AuI emitters deliver ultrapure&#8208;green OLEDs with external quantum efficiencies of up to 30.3&#8201;%, alongside diminished roll&#8208;offs as low as 0.8&#8201;% and device lifetimes (LT60) of 1210&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Acceleration of singlet&#8208;triplet intersystem crossings (ISC) is instrumental in bolstering triplet exciton harvesting of multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. This work describes a simple gold(I) coordination strategy to enhance the spin&#8208;orbit coupling of green and blue BN(O)&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters, which results in a notable increase in rate constants of the spectroscopically observed ISC process to 3&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1 with nearly unitary ISC quantum yields. Accordingly, the resultant thermally&#8208;stable AuI emitters attained large values of delayed fluorescence radiative rate constant up to 1.3&#215;105/1.7&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1 in THF/PMMA film while preserving narrowband emissions (FWHM=30&#8211;37&#8197;nm) and high emission quantum yields (ca. 0.9). The vapor&#8208;deposited ultrapure&#8208;green OLEDs fabricated with these AuI emitters delivered high luminance of up to 2.53&#215;105&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 as well as external quantum efficiencies of up to 30.3&#8201;% with roll&#8208;offs as low as 0.8&#8201;% and long device lifetimes (LT60) of 1210&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

Accordingly, the resultant thermally-stable Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; emitters attained large values of delayed fluorescence radiative rate constant up to 1.3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/1.7&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in THF/PMMA film while preserving narrowband emissions (FWHM=30&#8211;37&#8197;nm) and high emission quantum yields (ca. 0.9). The vapor-deposited ultrapure-green OLEDs fabricated with these Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; emitters delivered high luminance of up to 2.53&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; as well as external quantum efficiencies of up to 30.3&#8201;% with roll-offs as low as 0.8&#8201;% and long device lifetimes (LT&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1210&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiprocessing Quantum Computing through Hyperfine Couplings in Endohedral Fullerene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical derivatives of endohedral nitrogen fullerenes with long coherence time were used to demonstrate the multiprocessing of quantum computing with different subgroups of energy transitions divided by hyperfine couplings. Cooperatively combining the parallelly calculated results enabled quantum error correction of a D&#8208;J algorithm and multi&#8208;task qubit manipulations of different types of quantum gates.







Abstract
Magnetic molecules have shown great potential in quantum information processing due to the chemical tunablity of their quantum behaviors. Chemical derivatives of endohedral nitrogen fullerenes with long coherence time and rich energy levels were synthesized and studied to demonstrate the ability of multiprocessing in quantum information using electron magnetic resonance. After initialization of the 12&#8208;levelled spin system, subgroups of spin energy levels coursed by the hyperfine couplings can be selectively manipulated. The cooperatively combining of the parallel calculations enabled quantum error correction, increasing the correct rate by up to 17.82&#8201;%. Also, different subgroups of transitions divided by hyperfine coupling can be treated as independent qubits, and multi&#8208;task quantum computing were realized by performing Z&#8208;gate and X&#8208;gate simultaneously, which accelerates the overall gating speed.

         <title>An Electrocatalytic Model of the Sulfur Reduction Reaction in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic model is proposed to probe the sulfur reduction reaction pathway in working lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries by considering the adsorption free energy of LiS&#8901;, LiS2&#8901;, and LiS3&#8901; radicals as descriptors. With an overall consideration of &#916;G(LiS3&#8901;*), &#916;G(LiS2&#8901;*), and &#916;G(LiS&#8901;*) descriptors, a regional diagram model is constructed to visualize the overpotential and rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is strongly considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems due to its high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the sluggish reduction kinetics from Li2S4 to Li2S during discharge hinders the practical application of Li&#8211;S batteries. Although various electrocatalysts have been proposed to improve the reaction kinetics, the electrocatalytic mechanism is unclear due to the complexity of sulfur reduction reactions (SRR). It is crucial to understand the electrocatalytic mechanism thoroughly for designing advanced electrocatalysts. Herein an electrocatalytic model is constructed to reveal the chemical mechanism of the SRR in Li&#8211;S batteries based on systematical density functional theory calculations, taking heteroatoms&#8208;doped carbon materials as an example. The adsorption energy of LiSy&#8901; (y=1, 2, or 3) radicals is used as a key descriptor to predict the reaction pathway, rate&#8208;determining step, and overpotential. A diagram for designing advanced electrocatalysts is accordingly constructed. This work establishes a theoretical model, which is an intelligent integration for probing the complicated SRR mechanisms and designing advanced electrocatalysts for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>The Electronic Origin of the Zeta Potential is Supported by the Redox Mechanism on an Aqueous Dispersion of Exfoliated Graphite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous graphite dispersion was prepared without passivating agents and a minimal amount of functional groups by treating graphite with ammonium hydroxide. This approach has raised the Fermi level above the original value. The negative zeta potential has been revisited and attributed to the electrons accumulated on the material.







Abstract
Herein we have proposed that a redox mechanism can produce surface charges and negative zeta potential on an aqueous graphite dispersion. Graphite was kept in contact with a concentrated ammonia aqueous solution, washed, and exfoliated in water, resulting in a dispersion with lyophobic nature. Ammonia treatment did not provide functional groups or nitrogen doping to graphite. Moreover, this material was washed twice before sonication to remove most hydroxide. Therefore, neither functional groups, nitrogen atoms, nor hydroxide excess is responsible for the zeta potential. Kelvin probe force microscopy has shown that the ammonia&#8208;treated and exfoliated graphite has higher Fermi level than the water&#8208;treated material, indicating that the contact between ammonia and graphite promotes redox reactions that provide electrons to graphite. These electrons raise the Fermi level of graphite and generate the negative zeta potential, consequently, they account for the colloidal stability.

         <title>Identification of Cysteine 270 as a Novel Site for Allosteric Modulators of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Papain&#8208;Like Protease
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two allosteric and covalent activators of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro) were identified to elucidate a novel site, cysteine 270 (C270), which led to the discovery of an endogenous activator and an inhibitor of the protease. This study provides a paradigm for identifying covalent and allosteric sites and offers an opportunity for the development of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 PLpro inhibitors.







Abstract
The coronavirus papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro) plays an important role in the proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins and the dysregulation of the host immune response, providing a promising therapeutic target. However, the development of inhibitors against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) PLpro is challenging owing to the restricted S1/S2 sites in the substrate binding pocket. Here we report the discovery of two activators of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 PLpro and the identification of the unique residue, cysteine 270 (C270), as an allosteric and covalent regulatory site for the activators. This site is also specifically modified by glutathione, resulting in protease activation. Furthermore, a compound was found to allosterically inhibit the protease activity by covalent binding to C270. Together, these results elucidate an unrevealed molecular mechanism for allosteric modulation of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 PLpro and provid a novel site for allosteric inhibitors design.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Selective Activation of Toll&#8208;Like Receptor 7/8 Agonist Nano&#8208;Immunomodulator Generates Safe Anti&#8208;Tumor Immune Responses upon Systemic Administration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the uncontrolled off&#8208;target systemic immune&#8208;related adverse effects (irAEs) of imidazoquinolines after systemic administration, we developed a nano&#8208;immunomodulator (cN@SS&#8208;IMQ) that is inactive until it is selectively metabolized to an active immunostimulant within tumor cells. cN@SS&#8208;IMQ promoted robust immune activation within tumors while limiting extra&#8208;tumoral stimulation, suggesting its promising potential for systemically targeting innate immune tumor stimulators.







Abstract
Agonists of innate pattern recognition receptors such as toll&#8208;like receptors (TLRs) prime adaptive anti&#8208;tumor immunity and hold promise for cancer immunotherapy. However, small&#8208;molecule TLR agonists cause immune&#8208;related adverse effects (irAEs) after systemic administration. Herein, we report a polymeric nano&#8208;immunomodulator (cN@SS&#8208;IMQ) that is inactive until it is selectively metabolized to an active immunostimulant within the tumor. cN@SS&#8208;IMQ was obtained via self&#8208;assembly of a cyclo(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;D&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys)&#8208;modified amphiphilic copolymeric prodrug. Upon systemic administration, cN@SS&#8208;IMQ preferentially accumulated at tumor sites and responded to high intracellular glutathione levels to release native imidazoquinolines for dendritic cell maturation, thereby enhancing the infiltration of T lymphocytes. Collectively, cN@SS&#8208;IMQ tends to activate the immune system without irAEs, thus suggesting its promising potential for safe systemic targeting delivery.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Acylation of Alkenes by a Single Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reaction for the difunctionalization of terminal alkenes with an acyl group and a fluoromethyl, alkyl, sulfonyl, or thioether group was developed with acylation at the internal position by using a single photocatalyst. Key to success was a kinetic difference in the reactivity of the radical precursors with the excited photocatalyst, whereby the terminal position was first occupied by the more kinetically favorable radical precursor.







Abstract
A direct strategy for the difunctionalization of alkenes, with acylation occurring at the more substituted alkene position, would be attractive for complex ketone synthesis. We report herein a reaction driven by a single photocatalyst that enables &#945;&#8208;acylation in this way with the introduction of a fluoromethyl, alkyl, sulfonyl or thioether group at the &#946;&#8208;position of the alkene with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity under extremely mild conditions. Crucial to the success of this method are rate differences in the kinetics of radical generation through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) between different radical precursors and the excited photocatalyst (PC*). Thus, the &#946;&#8208;position of the alkene is first occupied by the group derived from the radical precursor that can be generated most readily, and &#945;&#8208;keto acids could be used as an electrophilic reagent for the &#945;&#8208;acylation of alkenes.

         <title>Edge&#8208;to&#8208;Center Propagation of Photochemical Reaction during Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Photomechanical Transformation of 2,5&#8208;Distyrylpyrazine Crystals

         <dc:description>
The edge&#8208;to&#8208;center propagation of a photochemical reaction during the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photomechanical transformation was newly found for a 2,5&#8208;distyrylpyrazine (DSP) single crystal. This is in contrast to the fact that the photochemical reaction generally proceeds homogeneously in molecular crystals.







Abstract
Photomechanical molecular crystals are promising materials for photon&#8208;powered artificial actuators. To interpret the photomechanical responses, the spatiotemporal distribution of photoproducts in crystals could be an important role in addition to molecular structures, molecular packings, illumination conditions, crystal morphology, crystal size, and so on. In this study, we have found that single crystals of 2,5&#8208;distyrylpyrazine show a smooth single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photomechanical expansion, and the photochemical reaction propagates from the edge to the center of the single crystal. We revealed that the surface effect (special reactivity at the crystal surface) in addition to the cooperative effect (the reaction is facilitated by neighboring molecules) is essential for the edge&#8208;to&#8208;center propagation of the photochemical reaction. Our results would provide a foundation for future studies of the photochemical reaction dynamics in photomechanical molecular crystals.

         <dc:description>
The photochemical reaction of 2,5&#8208;distyrylpyrazine single crystals was investigated by Daichi Kitagawa, Seiya Kobatake, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202212290). Under uniform illumination conditions, the photochemical reaction starts from the edge of the crystals and propagates to the center. Both surface and cooperative effects are shown to be essential for this edge&#8208;to&#8208;center propagation of the photochemical reaction.

Methanogen&#8211;semiconductor biohybrids drive the sustainable conversion of microplastics into CH4 under illumination, as reported by Shungui Zhou, Yujie Xiong, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202213244). The biotic&#8211;abiotic hybrid system not only addresses a long&#8208;standing challenge of photocatalysis by fully utilizing photogenerated electrons and holes without the need for unsustainable chemical sacrificial quenchers, but also provides clues for a better understanding of the global carbon cycle.

A new generation of solid superbases derived from potassium single atoms is described by You Han, Lin&#8208;Bing Sun, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202215157). The source of basicity is different from conventional basicity originating from oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Because of the superbasicity as well as high dispersion and anchoring of the basic sites, the potassium single atoms on graphene exhibit excellent catalytic activity and stability in transesterification reactions.

         <title>Photoexcited Enzymes for Asymmetric Csp3&#8722;Csp3 Cross&#8208;Electrophile Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of photochemistry with enzyme catalysis offers exciting opportunities to induce new reactivities and to create novel enzymes for reactions other than their native ones. Recently, Hyster and co&#8208;workers demonstrated this for a photoenzymatic asymmetric Csp3&#8722;Csp3 cross&#8208;electrophile coupling, a reactivity previously unknown to enzymes.







Abstract
Enzymes have several advantages over conventional catalysts for organic synthesis. Over the last two decades, much effort has been made to further extend the scope of biocatalytic reactions available to synthetic chemists, particularly by expanding the repertoire of enzymes for abiological transformations. In this regard, exciting new developments in the area of photobiocatalysis enable now the introduction of non&#8208;natural reactivity in enzymes to solve long&#8208;standing synthetic challenges. A recently described example from the Hyster group demonstrates in an unprecedented way how the combination of photochemistry with enzyme catalysis empowers the catalytic asymmetric construction of Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bonds with high chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Reduction in the Presence of Impurities: Influences and Mitigation Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Power plants release CO2 and gaseous impurities into the atmosphere. In recent years, the effect of gaseous impurities on CO2 electrolysis has emerged as an important research topic, with an emphasis placed on understanding the catalytic reaction and developing mitigation strategies to lessen the negative effects of gaseous impurities.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of waste CO2 into useful fuels and chemical products is a promising approach to reduce CO2 emissions; however, several challenges still remain to be addressed. Thus far, most CO2 reduction studies use pure CO2 as the gas reactant, but CO2 emissions typically contain a number of gas impurities, such as nitrogen oxides, oxygen gas, and sulfur oxides. Gas impurities in CO2 can pose a significant obstacle for efficient CO2 electrolysis because they can influence the reaction and catalyst. This Minireview highlights early examples of CO2 reduction studies using mixed&#8208;gas feeds, explores strategies to sustain CO2 reduction in the presence of gas impurities, and discusses their implications for future progress in this emerging field.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Interactions in Diatomic Catalysts Boosting Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diatomic catalysts have attracted much attention, especially in electrochemistry. However, there have been no comprehensive reviews on long&#8208;range interactions (LRIs) between metallic centres. This Minireview introduces the key aspects of LRIs and highlights opportunities for regulating electrocatalytic mechanisms, thus presenting guidelines for the targeted usage of LRIs.







Abstract
The simultaneous presence of two active metal centres in diatomic catalysts (DACs) leads to the occurrence of specific interactions between active sites. Such interactions, referred to as long&#8208;range interactions (LRIs), play an important role in determining the rate and selectivity of a reaction. The optimal combination of metal centres must be determined to achieve the targeted efficiency. To date, various types of DACs have been synthesised and applied in electrochemistry. However, LRIs have not been systematically summarised. Herein, the regulation, mechanism, and electrocatalytic applications of LRIs are comprehensively summarised and discussed. In addition to the basic information above, the challenges, opportunities, and future development of LRIs in DACs are proposed in order to present an overall view and reference for future research.

However, LRIs have not been systematically summarised. Herein, the regulation, mechanism, and electrocatalytic applications of LRIs are comprehensively summarised and discussed. In addition to the basic information above, the challenges, opportunities, and future development of LRIs in DACs are proposed in order to present an overall view and reference for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biocatalytic Synthesis Using Self&#8208;Assembled Polymeric Nano&#8208; and Microreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of polymeric systems for bioconversion is an efficient and recyclable technology for the future industry due to its zero&#8208;pollution features. This Review focuses on self&#8208;assembled polymeric nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;sized structures and their application as biocatalytic reactors for chemical synthesis, including polymersomes, reverse micelles, polymer emulsions, Pickering emulsions, and static emulsions.







Abstract
Biocatalysis is increasingly being explored for the sustainable development of green industry. Though enzymes show great industrial potential with their high efficiency, specificity, and selectivity, they suffer from poor usability and stability under abiological conditions. To solve these problems, researchers have fabricated nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;sized biocatalytic reactors based on the self&#8208;assembly of various polymers, leading to highly stable, functional, and reusable biocatalytic systems. This Review highlights recent progress in self&#8208;assembled polymeric nano&#8208; and microreactors for biocatalytic synthesis, including polymersomes, reverse micelles, polymer emulsions, Pickering emulsions, and static emulsions. We categorize these reactors into monophasic and biphasic systems and discuss their structural characteristics and latest successes with representative examples. We also consider the challenges and potential solutions associated with the future development of this field.

The fundamental physical and electrochemical properties of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are scrutinized with particular attention paid to the similarity and difference between Mg&#8208;ion and the popular Li&#8208;ion based electrolytes. The Review was written with the intention of accelerating the development of sustainable and high&#8208;performance battery technologies.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have been considered as one of the most viable battery chemistries amongst the &#8220;post&#8221; lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) technologies owing to their high volumetric capacity and the natural abundance of their key elements. The fundamental properties of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are of essence to regulate the overall performance of RMBs. In this Review, the basic electrochemistry of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes batteries is discussed and compared to that of the Li&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes, and a comprehensive overview of the development of different Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes is provided. In addition, the remaining challenges and possible solutions for future research are intensively discussed. The present work is expected to give an impetus to inspire the discovery of key electrolytes and thereby improve the electrochemical performances of RMBs and other related emerging battery technologies.

         <title>Native Amide&#8208;Directed C(sp3)&#8722;H Amidation Enabled by Electron&#8208;Deficient RhIII Catalyst and Electron&#8208;Deficient 2&#8208;Pyridone Ligand</title>

         <dc:description>
Direct C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reactions of native amides can facilitate streamlined synthesis of valuable molecules, but their insufficient directing ability is one of the current severe challenges of the field. Here we report that the combination of an electron&#8208;deficient RhIII catalyst and an electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand shows high catalytic activity for C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation of various native amides.







Abstract
Trivalent group&#8208;9 metal catalysts with a cyclopentadienyl&#8208;type ligand (CpMIII; M=Co, Rh, Ir, Cp=cyclopentadienyl) have been widely used for directed C&#8722;H functionalizations, albeit that their application to challenging C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalizations suffers from the limitations of the available directing groups. In this report, we describe directed C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation reactions of simple amide substrates with a variety of substituents. The combination of an electron&#8208;deficient CpERh catalyst (CpE=1,3&#8208;bis(ethoxycarbonyl)&#8208;substituted Cp) and an electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand is essential for high reactivity.

         <title>Stereochemistry Controls Dihydrogen Bonding Strengths in Chiral Amine Boranes Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
How the strength of the N&#8722;H&#948;+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#948;&#8722;H&#8722;B interaction and hence the DHB&#8208;driven self&#8208;aggregation of amine&#8208;borane adducts is governed by steric effects has been investigated by comparing the structures and binding enthalpies of various chiral derivatives. For a diastereomeric pair of amine&#8208;boranes prepared from a chiral secondary amine, it is shown that the stereochemistry at the nitrogen atom has a significant influence on the interaction enthalpy.







Abstract
The growing interest in exploiting novel concepts of non&#8208;covalent interactions in catalysts and supramolecular chemistry made us revisit a special kind of hydrogen bonding: the dihydrogen bond (DHB), formed between a classical hydrogen bond donor and a hydridic hydrogen as acceptor. Herein, we investigate how the strength of the N&#8722;H&#948;+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#948;&#8722;H&#8722;B interaction and hence the DHB&#8208;driven self&#8208;aggregation of amine&#8208;borane adducts is governed by steric effects by comparing the structures and binding enthalpies of various chiral derivatives. For a diastereomeric pair of amine&#8208;boranes prepared from a chiral secondary amine, we show that the stereochemistry at the nitrogen has significant influence on the interaction enthalpy. Based on this finding, N&#8208;chiral amine boranes can be envisioned to become interesting building blocks in supramolecular chemistry to fine&#8208;tune the formation dynamics of assemblies.

         <title>Selective Cross&#8208;Ketonization of Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsymmetrical ketones can be prepared through selective coupling of two structurally distinct carboxylic acids without the need for preactivation of either partner. This photoredox cross&#8208;ketonization strategy exploits differences in the rates of key one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron activation steps using the two reactants.







Abstract
Carboxylic acids are attractive building blocks for synthetic chemistry because they are chemically stable, abundant, and commercially available with substantial structural diversity. The process of combining two carboxylic acids to furnish a ketone is termed ketonization. This is a potentially valuable transformation that has been underutilized in organic synthesis due to the harsh reaction conditions generally required and the lack of selectivity obtained when coupling two distinct carboxylic acids. We report herein a metallaphotoredox strategy that selectively generates unsymmetrical ketones via cross&#8208;ketonization of two structurally dissimilar carboxylic acids. Cross&#8208;selectivity is achieved by exploiting divergent reactivity of differentially substituted acids towards critical one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron processes in the proposed coupling mechanism. This method is broadly applicable to a variety of functionalized carboxylic acids. It can also be applied to acids of similar steric profile by exploiting differences in their relative rates of decarboxylation.

         <title>Observation of an Alternate Charge&#8208;Polarization State in a One&#8208;Dimensional Pt&#8722;Pt&#8722;I Chain Compound with a Bulky Pendant Ligand</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis and physical properties of a new one&#8208;dimensional (1D) halogen&#8208;bridged dinuclear&#8208;metal complex (MMX&#8208;chain) with a rigid and bulky pendant ligand are reported. The steric hindrance derived from the bulkiness induces a strain in its 1D chain, achieving the first pure electronic state coupled with lattice distortion at ambient condition. The strain effect also appears as a very large linear thermal expansion along the 1D chain.







Abstract
A one&#8208;dimensional&#8197;(1D) halogen&#8208;bridged dinuclear&#8208;metal complex (MMX&#8208;chain) exhibits various electronic states based on a mixed&#8208;valence metal&#8208;dimer system. This report deals with the synthesis and physical properties of a new MMX&#8208;chain with a bulky pendant ligand, Pt2(mcc&#8208;HexCS2)4I (mcc&#8208;HexCS2=trans&#8208;4&#8208;(methoxycarbonyl)cyclohexanedithiocarboxylate). The steric hindrance caused by the bulky substituent induces a strain in its 1D chain, achieving at ambient condition the first pure alternate charge&#8208;polarization (ACP) state (&#8722;Pt2+&#8722;Pt3+&#8722;I&#8722;&#8722;Pt3+&#8722;Pt2+&#8722;I&#8722;&#8722;), a kind of spin&#8208;Peierls state, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and its conducting and magnetic properties. The strain effect is also manifested as a very large linear thermal expansion along the chain direction, which is quite different from conventional MMX&#8208;chains without a bulky ligand. The design of low&#8208;dimensional materials with ligand variations is expected to lead to the emergence of new electron&#8211;lattice coupled electronic states.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperativity to Assemble a Neutral and Terminal Niobium Phosphorus Triple Bond (Nb&#8801;P)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus atom transfer from [PCO]&#8722; to the NbIV precursor [(PNP)NbCl2(NtBuAr)] (PNP=N[2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl]2&#8722;; Ar=3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3) resulted in decarbonylation and coupling of the P&#8208;atom to give [(PNPP)NbCl(NtBuAr)]. Reduction by one electron afforded the first neutral and terminal phosphido ligand on Nb, and two electron oxidation reformed the P&#8722;P bond. Computational studies were conducted to understand the mechanism in this set of transformations.







Abstract
Decarbonylation along with P&#8208;atom transfer from the phosphaethynolate anion, PCO&#8722;, to the NbIV complex [(PNP)NbCl2(NtBuAr)] (1) (PNP=N[2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl]2&#8722;; Ar=3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3) results in its coupling with one of the phosphine arms of the pincer ligand to produce a phosphanylidene phosphorane complex [(PNPP)NbCl(NtBuAr)] (2). Reduction of 2 with CoCp*2 cleaves the P&#8722;P bond to form the first neutral and terminal phosphido complex of a group 5 transition metal, namely, [(PNP)Nb&#8801;P(NtBuAr)] (3). Theoretical studies have been used to understand both the coupling of the P&#8208;atom and the reductive cleavage of the P&#8722;P bond. Reaction of 3 with a two&#8208;electron oxidant such as ethylene sulfide results in a diamagnetic sulfido complex having a P&#8722;P coupled ligand, namely [(PNPP)Nb=S(NtBuAr)] (4).

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Alkali Metal Antimonide&#8212;A New Approach to Antimony Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general synthetic pathway for the formation and isolation of the antimonides MSbH2 (M=alkali metal) is described. Starting from these SbH2&#8722; transfer reagents, the first primary silylstibane (Me3Si)3SiSbH2 was obtained.







Abstract
Alkali metal dihydrogen&#8208;antimonides [M(L)xSbH2], short: alkali metal antimonides (M=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; 1: L=pmdta; 2: L=crown&#8208;ether), were prepared from stibine and n&#8208;Butyllithium, M(hmds) (hmds=hexamethyldisilazane) or MOtBu, respectively. We developed a generally applicable synthesis route for these compounds and the obtained compounds were examined on their stability depending on the alkali metal and stabilizing additives used, whereby the use of appropriate crown&#8208;ethers allowed their isolation and characterization at room temperature. Moreover, the 1,4&#8208;dioxane adduct [Na(dioxane)xSbH2] was the appropriate starting compound for the synthesis of the first primary silylstibane (Me3Si)3SiSbH2 (3) which was characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy. Reaction of 3 with (Dipp2NacNac)Ga (Dipp2NacNac=HC{C(Me)N(Dipp)}2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) resulted in the formation of (Dipp2NacNac)GaH(SbHSi(SiMe3)3) (4) which was furthermore characterized by single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Bifunctional Europium for Operando Catalyst Thermometry in an Exothermic Chemical Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature determines the reaction kinetics, thermodynamics and catalyst stability. However, very limited information is known about the local catalyst temperature. Here, operando thermometry over bifunctional Eu3+ is performed to study the interplay between reaction conditions and the catalyst temperature dynamics in the exothermic methane oxychlorination reaction.







Abstract
Often the reactor or the reaction medium temperature is reported in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, even though it could vary significantly from the reactive catalyst temperature. The influence of the catalyst temperature on the catalytic performance and vice versa is therefore not always accurately known. We here apply EuOCl as both solid catalyst and thermometer, allowing for operando temperature determination. The interplay between reaction conditions and the catalyst temperature dynamics is studied. A maximum temperature difference between the catalyst and oven of +16&#8201;&#176;C was observed due to the exothermicity of the methane oxychlorination reaction. Heat dissipation by radiation appears dominating compared to convection in this set&#8208;up, explaining the observed uniform catalyst bed temperature. Application of operando catalyst thermometry could provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of catalyst performances and allow for safer process operation in chemical industries.

We here apply EuOCl as both solid catalyst and thermometer, allowing for &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt; temperature determination. The interplay between reaction conditions and the catalyst temperature dynamics is studied. A maximum temperature difference between the catalyst and oven of +16&#8201;&#176;C was observed due to the exothermicity of the methane oxychlorination reaction. Heat dissipation by radiation appears dominating compared to convection in this set-up, explaining the observed uniform catalyst bed temperature. Application of &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt; catalyst thermometry could provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of catalyst performances and allow for safer process operation in chemical industries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Devices Enabled by a Polyfullerene Electron Transporting Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyfullerene material (PFBS&#8208;C12) is developed that can work efficiently as the electron transporting material of p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs). PFBS&#8208;C12 retains the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits of conventional fullerene molecules, and shows suppressed aggregation and more conformal coverage on perovskites compared to PCBM. As a result, the p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs based on PFBS&#8208;C12 realize a high efficiency of 23.2&#8201;% with good device stability.







Abstract
Electron transporting materials (ETMs) play vital roles in determining the efficiency and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells. The widely used PCBM is prone to undesirable aggregation and migration in a cell, thus impairing device stability. In this work, we develop a new type of ETMs by polymerizing C60 fullerene with an aromantic linker unit. The resultant polyfullerene (PFBS&#8208;C12) not only maintains the good optoelectronic properties of fullerenes, but also can address the aforementioned aggregation problem of PCBM. The polyfullerene&#8208;based blade&#8208;coated cells exhibit a high efficiency of 23.2&#8201;% and good device stability that maintain 96&#8201;% of initial efficiency after &gt;1300&#8208;hour light soaking. An aperture efficiency of 18.9&#8201;% is also achieved on a 53.6&#8208;cm2 perovskite mini&#8208;module. This work provides a new strategy for designing ETMs that retain the key figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits of conventional fullerene molecules and enable more stable perovskite solar devices simultaneously.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Controlled Radical Copolymerization toward Hybrid Functional Fluoropolymers Driven by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free controlled radical copolymerization of trifluorovinyl boronic ester and vinyl esters has been established, enabling the on&#8208;demand synthesis of main&#8208;chain hybrid functional polymers driven by light. This work furnishes a facile and versatile strategy to tailor F/B&#8208;incorporated polymers, which facilitates chain&#8208;extensions, post modifications to unprecedented polymers, and allows innovations of copolymer electrolytes.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;controlled polymerizations are attractive to tailor macromolecules of complex compositions with spatiotemporal regulation. In this work, with a convenient synthesis for trifluorovinyl boronic ester (TFVB), we report a light&#8208;driven organocatalyzed copolymerization of vinyl monomers and TFVB for the first time, which enabled the controlled synthesis of a variety of hybrid fluorine/boron polymers with low dispersities and good chain&#8208;end fidelity. The good behaviors of &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; switch, chain&#8208;extension polymerizations and post&#8208;modifications further highlight the versatility and reliability of this copolymerization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of fluorine and boron could furnish copolymer electrolytes of high lithium&#8208;ion transference number (up to 0.83), bringing new opportunities of engineering high&#8208;performance materials for energy storage purposes.

         <title>A Sulfoxide Reagent for One&#8208;Pot, Three&#8208;Component Syntheses of Sulfoxides and Sulfinamides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon Grignard reactions, a simple sulfoxide reagent allows the formation of sulfenate anions that are subsequently transformed into sulfoxides and sulfinamides. This one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component method does not require substrates with preinstalled sulfur functional groups.







Abstract
Sulfoxides and sulfinamides represent versatile sulfur functional groups found in ligands, chiral auxiliaries, and bioactive molecules. Canonical two&#8208;component syntheses, however, rely on substrates with a preinstalled C&#8722;S bond and impede efficient and modular access to these sulfur motifs. Herein is presented the application of an easily prepared, bench&#8208;stable sulfoxide reagent for one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component syntheses of sulfoxides and sulfinamides. The sulfoxide reagent donates the SO unit upon the reaction with a Grignard reagent (RMgX) as a sulfenate anion (RSO&#8722;). While subsequent trapping reactions of this key intermediate with carbon electrophiles provide sulfoxides, a range of tertiary, secondary, and primary sulfinamides can be prepared by substitution reactions with electrophilic amines. The syntheses of sulfinamide analogs of amide&#8208; and sulfonamide&#8208;containing drugs illustrate the utility of the method for the rapid preparation of medicinally relevant molecules.

         <title>Broadband Photoresponses from Ultraviolet to Near&#8208;Infrared (II) Region through Light&#8208;induced Pyroelectric Effects in a Hybrid Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We realize broadband photoresponses covering UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR&#8208;II (266&#8211;1950&#8197;nm) spectral region through light&#8208;induced pyroelectric effect in a hybrid perovskite, which breaks the limitation of intrinsic optical band gap and provides a feasible way toward assembling broadband high&#8208;performance devices.







Abstract
Broadband photodetection has shown a great promise for diverse applications, while the realization of plateau photoresponse from ultraviolet (UV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral region is very challenging. Herein, we exploit photoexcited pyroelectric effect in a chiral hybrid perovskite, (N, N&#8208;dimethylcyclohexylammonium)PbBr3 (1), serving as a new pathway to drive broadband photoactivities. It is a room&#8208;temperature pyroelectric with large polarization of &#8776;6.4&#8197;&#956;C cm&#8722;2 and high pyroelectric figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits (FV=1.0&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201; &#956;C&#8722;1 and FD=7.1&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;Pa&#8722;1/2). Strikingly, light&#8208;induced pyroelectric effect arising from spontaneous polarization is observed in 1, which cover UV (266&#8197;nm) to NIR&#8208;II (1950&#8197;nm) full spectral region. The broadband photoresponses actualized by pyroelectricity break the limit of optical band gap. As the first demonstration of photo&#8208;pyroelectricity covering UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR spectral region in hybrid perovskites, this work paves a pathway to assemble high&#8208;performance smart devices.

         <dc:description>
A multicomponent [1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement/strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven anion relay sequence and its application to the modular synthesis of substituted azetidines is described. Three electrophilic coupling partners, whose identities can be individually varied, were added sequentially to the highly strained fragment azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl&#8208;lithium to access a diverse compound library.







Abstract
Despite the favorable properties that azetidine rings can engender on drug&#8208;compounds, methods for the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of azetidine&#8208;based structures are significantly underdeveloped. Herein, we report the successful realization of a multicomponent [1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement/strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven anion relay sequence and its application to the modular synthesis of substituted azetidines. The rapidity of the reaction, as confirmed by in situ infra&#8208;red spectroscopy, leverages the strain&#8208;release ring&#8208;opening of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane to drive the equilibrium of the Brook rearrangement. The three electrophilic coupling partners, added sequentially to azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl&#8208;lithium, could be individually varied to access a diverse compound library. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated in a 4&#8208;step synthesis of the EP2 receptor antagonist PF&#8208;04418948.

         <title>Superior Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Activation with Dimethyl Ether</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid dimethyl ether is shown to be a potent activating solvent for MOFs. The combination of low surface tension, high volatility, and coordinating ability allows efficient activation of even MOFs with coordinatively unsaturated sites. The broad applicability of the technique is demonstrated, and the level of activation achievable compares very favorably against existing activation protocols.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are demonstrated to be readily activated by treatment with the low surface tension, low boiling point solvent dimethyl ether (DME). The mildness of the method enables access to high surface areas by avoiding structural changes in the framework that often plague thermal activation methods. A distinction from previous methods is that DME activation succeeds for materials with coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) and non&#8208;CUS MOFs as well. DME displaces solvent molecules occupying the pores of the MOF as well as those coordinated to metal centers; reducing evacuation temperature by using a coordinating, yet highly volatile guest enables low temperature activation with structural retention as demonstrated surface area measurements that match or exceed existing activation protocols.

         <title>Access to N&#8722;CF3 Formamides by Reduction of N&#8722;CF3 Carbamoyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthetic access to N&#8208;trifluoromethylated formamides is reported. The method involves the reduction of bench&#8208;stable N&#8722;CF3 carbamoyl fluorides. In contrast to e.g. N&#8722;Me formamides, the newly made N&#8722;CF3 formamides do not show rotamers at room temperature. Moreover, they are highly robust and compatible with diverse chemical transformations.







Abstract
The departure into unknown chemical space is essential for the discovery of new properties and function. We herein report the first synthetic access to N&#8208;trifluoromethylated formamides. The method involves the reduction of bench&#8208;stable NCF3 carbamoyl fluorides and is characterized by operational simplicity and mildness, tolerating a broad range of functional groups as well as stereocenters. The newly made N&#8722;CF3 formamide motif proved to be highly robust and compatible with diverse chemical transformations, underscoring its potential as building block in complex functional molecules.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled Ru(bda) Coordination Oligomers as Efficient Catalysts for Visible Light&#8208;Driven Water Oxidation in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble Ru(bda) coordination oligomers with varying lengths are investigated in visible light&#8208;driven water oxidation catalysis. The excellent performance and stability of longer oligomers in pure water is rationalized by the very high local concentrations of active sites in self&#8208;assembled superstructures.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble multinuclear complexes based on ruthenium 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate (bda) and ditopic bipyridine linker units are investigated in three&#8208;component visible light&#8208;driven water oxidation catalysis. Systematic studies revealed a strong enhancement of the catalytic efficiency in the absence of organic co&#8208;solvents and with increasing oligomer length. In&#8208;depth kinetic and morphological investigations suggest that the enhanced performance is induced by the self&#8208;assembly of linear Ru(bda) oligomers into aggregated superstructures. The obtained turnover frequencies (up to 14.9&#8197;s&#8722;1) and turnover numbers (more than 1000) per ruthenium center are the highest reported so far for Ru(bda)&#8208;based photocatalytic water oxidation systems.

An iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of branched allylic phosphine compounds under mild conditions is reported. Products bearing various functional groups can be synthesized with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 99.9&#8201;% ee) and regioselectivity. The employment of phosphine sulfides with relatively low deactivation capacity against metal catalysts is crucial for the success of this reaction.

         <title>Conversion of a AuI Fluorido Complex into an N&#8208;Fluoroamido Derivative: N&#8722;F versus Au&#8722;N Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of a fluoroamido complex was achieved on reaction of [Au(F)(SPhos)] with NFSI. Reactivity studies revealed the insertion of CO into the N&#8722;F bond. The transfer of the fluoroamido group onto organic molecules was also accomplished.







Abstract
The AuI complex [Au{N(F)SO2Ph}(SPhos)] (SPhos=dicyclohexyl(2&#8242;,6&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxy[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphane) (2) bearing a fluoroamido ligand has been synthesized by reaction of the fluorido complex [Au(F)(SPhos)] (1) with NFSI (NFSI=N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide). A reaction with CO resulted in an unprecedented insertion into the N&#8722;F bond at 2. With the carbene precursor N2CH(CO2Et) N&#8722;F bond cleavage gave the Au&#8722;F bond insertion product [Au{CHF(CO2C2H5)}(SPhos)] (7). The presence of CNtBu led to Au&#8722;N cleavage at 2 and concomitant amide formation to give the cationic complex [Au(CNtBu)(SPhos)][N(F)SO2Ph)] (5), which reacted further to give FtBu as well as the cyanido complex [Au(CN)(SPhos)] (6).

     alt="Conversion of a AuI Fluorido Complex into an N-Fluoroamido Derivative: N&#8722;F versus Au&#8722;N Reactivity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formation of a fluoroamido complex was achieved on reaction of [Au(F)(SPhos)] with NFSI. Reactivity studies revealed the insertion of CO into the N&#8722;F bond. The transfer of the fluoroamido group onto organic molecules was also accomplished.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complex [Au{N(F)SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph}(SPhos)] (SPhos=dicyclohexyl(2&#8242;,6&#8242;-dimethoxy[1,1&#8242;-biphenyl]-2-yl)phosphane) (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) bearing a fluoroamido ligand has been synthesized by reaction of the fluorido complex [Au(F)(SPhos)] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with NFSI (NFSI=&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-fluorobenzenesulfonimide). A reaction with CO resulted in an unprecedented insertion into the N&#8722;F bond at &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. With the carbene precursor N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Et) N&#8722;F bond cleavage gave the Au&#8722;F bond insertion product [Au{CHF(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)}(SPhos)] (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;). The presence of CN&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu led to Au&#8722;N cleavage at &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and concomitant amide formation to give the cationic complex [Au(CN&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)(SPhos)][N(F)SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph)] (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), which reacted further to give F&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu as well as the cyanido complex [Au(CN)(SPhos)] (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;). These results led to the development of a process for the amination of electrophilic organic substrates by transfer of the fluoroamido group NF(SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Shot Synthesis of B/N&#8208;Doped Calix[4]arene Exhibiting Narrowband Multiple Resonance Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped calix[4]arene named C&#8208;BN was successfully synthesized through one&#8208;shot double borylation. C&#8208;BN shows a highly centrosymmetric structure with two multiple resonance fragments bridged by tertiary amine groups at the 1,3 positions of the benzene ring. The optimized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes can exhibit high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 24.7&#8211;26.6&#8201;% and small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;max of 25&#8211;28&#8197;nm over a wide doping range of 1&#8211;12&#8197;wt&#8201;%.







Abstract
A novel macrocycle of B/N&#8208;doped calix[4]arene (C&#8208;BN) was synthesized by a one&#8208;shot double boronation. Owing to the structural tension and electron&#8208;donating properties of the nitrogen atoms in the macrocycle, reaction selectively proceeds between the adjacent benzene rings outside the macrocycle. C&#8208;BN shows a highly centrosymmetric structure with two multiple resonance (MR) fragments bridged by tertiary amine groups at the 1,3 positions of the benzene ring. Benefiting from the large intermolecular distance (&gt;4.6&#8197;&#197;) between adjacent MR&#8208;emitting cores, C&#8208;BN also exhibits excellent narrowband emitting features against aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and spectrum broadening. Optimized organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices based on C&#8208;BN exhibit high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 24.7&#8211;26.6&#8201;% and small full width at half maximums of 25&#8211;28&#8197;nm over a wide doping range of 1&#8211;12&#8197;wt&#8201;%.

         <title>Highly Oxidation&#8208;Resistant Electrolyte for 4.7&#8197;V Sodium Metal Batteries Enabled by Anion/Cation Solvation Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4.7&#8197;V oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolyte with self&#8208;purifying ability is successfully designed by anion/cation solvation strategy with NaClO4 and TPFS as dual additives. The Na||NVPF battery with such electrolyte could exhibit superior electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) are considered as promising battery system due to abundant Na sources. However, poor compatibility between electrolyte and cathode severely impedes its development. Herein, we proposed an anion/cation solvation strategy for realizing 4.7&#8197;V resistant SMBs electrolyte with NaClO4 and trimethoxy(pentafluorophenyl)silane (TPFS) as dual additives (DA). The ClO4&#8722; can rapidly transfer to the cathode surface and strongly coordinate with Na+ to form stable polymer&#8208;like chains with solvents. Meanwhile, TPFS can preferentially enter into the PF6&#8722; anion solvation sheath for reducing PF6&#8208;solvent interaction and effectively scavenge adverse electrolyte species for protecting electrode electrolyte interphases. Thus, such electrolyte elevates the oxidative stability of carbonate electrolytes from 3.77 to 4.75&#8197;V, and enables Na||Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPF) battery with a capacity retention of 93&#8201;% and an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles at 4.7&#8197;V.

Halide anions have been successfully inserted into the cavity of a 19&#8208;membered open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative at 60&#8201;&#176;C for Cl&#8722; and 90&#8201;&#176;C for F&#8722;, Br&#8722; and I&#8722; under atmospheric pressure. The encapsulation ratio is quantitative as shown by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis data and spectroscopic data. The presence of halide ions improves the stability of the cage structure, which could be stored at r.t. for weeks without noticeable change.







Abstract
A 19&#8208;membered open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative was prepared from C60 in 7&#8197;steps and 5.5&#8201;% yield through the peroxide&#8208;mediate pathway. There are four carbonyl groups, an ether oxygen and a quinoxaline moiety on the rim of the orifice. A chloride anion could be inserted into its cavity by heating with hydrochloric acid at 60&#8201;&#176;C for 4&#8197;h. Encapsulation of fluoride, bromide and iodide anions was also achieved at slightly more forcing conditions, 90&#8201;&#176;C for 14&#8197;h. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the sodium salt of the chloride and the bromide encapsulated derivatives were obtained, which showed the halide anion in the center of the cavity and two sodium cations connecting two cages through coordination to the oxygen atoms on the rim of the orifices. The halide encapsulation ratio is quantitative in the isolated products.
