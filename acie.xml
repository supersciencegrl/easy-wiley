         <title>Expanding the Structural Diversity of Protein Building Blocks with Noncanonical Amino Acids Biosynthesized from Aromatic Thiols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nearly 50 novel noncanonical amino acids were efficiently biosynthesized in cells from simple aromatic thiol precursors and incorporated into proteins via genetic code expansion. Expression yields of proteins containing biosynthesized reactive amino acids were high, which allowed subsequent bioorthogonal chemical conjugation for both research and therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Incorporation of structurally novel noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins is valuable for both scientific and biomedical applications. To expand the structural diversity of available ncAAs and to reduce the burden of chemically synthesizing them, we have developed a general and simple biosynthetic method for genetically encoding novel ncAAs into recombinant proteins by feeding cells with economical commercially available or synthetically accessible aromatic thiols. We demonstrate that nearly 50 ncAAs with a diverse array of structures can be biosynthesized from these simple small&#8208;molecule precursors by hijacking the cysteine biosynthetic enzymes, and the resulting ncAAs can subsequently be incorporated into proteins via an expanded genetic code. Moreover, we demonstrate that bioorthogonal reactive groups such as aromatic azides and aromatic ketones can be incorporated into green fluorescent protein or a therapeutic antibody with high yields, allowing for subsequent chemical conjugation.

         <title>Reversing the Chirality of Surface Ligands Can Improve the Biosafety and Pharmacokinetics of Cationic Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Severe toxicity and rapid  in vivo  clearance of cationic nanomaterials seriously hinder their clinical translation. Present strategies to improve the biosafety and  in vivo  performance of cationic nanomaterials require neutralization of positive charge, which often compromises their efficacy. Herein, we report that substituting L&#8208;glutathione (L&#8208;GSH) on cationic gold nanoclusters (GNCs) with its D&#8208;counterpart can effectively improve the biosafety and pharmacokinetics. Compared with L&#8208;GNCs, D&#8208;GNCs do not exhibit cellular cytotoxicity, hemolysis, or acute damage to organs. Cationic D&#8208;GNCs show less cell internalization than L&#8208;GNCs, and do not induce cellular apoptosis.  In vivo  , the chirality of surface ligands distinctly affects the pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting abilities of D&#8208; /L&#8208;GNCs. D&#8208;GNCs show higher extended circulation time in blood plasma compared to similarly&#8208;sized and poly (ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles. This work demonstrates that the choice of chirality of surface ligands can determine toxicities and pharmacokinetics of cationic nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Inspired by the crystal structure that reveals incompatibility in inter&#8208;chain separation distance between H&#8208;bonded amide groups and straight alkyl chains, we deviced and demonstrated a powerful broadly applicable social self&#8208;sorting strategy, enabling cation&#8208;binding crown ether groups and anion&#8208;binding fluorobenzene groups to be alternatively packed. This generates a 3&#8208;in&#8208;1 transporter system, promoting transmembrane transport of cations, anions and zwitterionic species such as amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfering with Metabolic Profile of Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer using Rationally&#8208;Designed Metformin Prodrugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. Even though TNBC patients respond well to chemotherapy, they quickly relapse, resulting in poor prognoses and low survival rates. TNBCs are characterized by an aberrant metabolic phenotype with high metastatic capacity due to reprogramming of metabolic pathways to fulfill their bioenergetics demands. We designed a series of novel Au  III  cyclometalated prodrugs of energy&#8208;disrupting Type II antidiabetic drugs namely, metformin and phenformin. Prodrug activation and release of the metformin ligand was achieved by tuning the cyclometalated Au  III  fragment. The lead complex  3  met  was 6000&#8208;fold more cytotoxic compared to uncoordinated metformin and demonstrated synergistic action of metformin and Au  III  species. Importantly,  3  met  significantly reduced tumor burden in mice with aggressive breast cancers and caused lymphocytic infiltration into tumor tissues, indicating activation of immune system. We ascribe these effects to the ability of  3  met  to target energy&#8208;dependent TNBCs through the interference with cancer cell energy production and inhibition of associated cellular pro&#8208;survival responses to selectively induce deadly metabolic catastrophe.</dc:description>

         <title>Multinuclear Ag Clusters Sandwiched by Pt Complex Units: Fluxional Behavior and Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Cluster Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New types of multinuclear sandwich complexes consisting of an Ag3 core and Pt complex units are reported. The first observation of CD and CPL properties from a multinuclear sandwich complex was achieved after optical resolution using a chiral anion.







Abstract
Multinuclear Ag clusters sandwiched by Pt complex units were synthesized and characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR studies. The sandwich&#8208;shaped multinuclear Ag complexes showed two different types of fluxional behavior in solution: rapid slippage of Pt complex units on the Ag3 core and a reversible demetalation&#8211;metalation reaction by the treatment with Cl anion and Ag ion, respectively. The Ag2 complex obtained by demetalation reaction from the Ag3 complex displayed U to Z isomerization. These multinuclear Ag complexes showed strong photoluminescence whose properties depended on the existence of Pt&#8594;Ag dative bonds. The Ag3 complex, identified to be &#8220;chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cluster&#8221;, was optically resolved by the formation of a diastereomeric salt with a chiral anion. The enantiomers show circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties which is unprecedented for compounds based on a chiral sandwich structure. Theoretical calculations allow to understand their structural features and photophysical properties.

         <title>Development of Generic G Protein Peptidomimetics Able to Stabilize Active State Gs Protein&#8208;Coupled Receptors for Application in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the crystal structure of the &#946;2AR coupled to the Gs protein, a helical key epitope was chosen as a template to design peptidomimetics able to stabilize active&#8208;state Gs protein&#8208;coupled receptors. Radioligand assays were performed in the presence of the peptide mimetics and demonstrated the stabilization of Gs receptors in active conformation, opening a gateway for fragment&#8208;based, agonist&#8208;earmarked drug discovery programs.







Abstract
G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent an important group of membrane proteins that play a central role in modern medicine. Unfortunately, conformational promiscuity hampers full therapeutic exploitation of GPCRs, since the largest population of the receptor will adopt a basal conformation, which subsequently challenges screens for agonist drug discovery programs. Herein, we describe a set of peptidomimetics able to mimic the ability of G proteins in stabilizing the active state of the &#946;2 adrenergic receptor (&#946;2AR) and the dopamine 1 receptor (D1R). During fragment&#8208;based screening efforts, these (un)constrained peptide analogues of the &#945;5 helix in Gs proteins, were able to identify agonism pre&#8208;imprinted fragments for the examined GPCRs, and as such, they behave as a generic tool, enabling an engagement in agonist earmarked discovery programs.

Herein, we describe a set of peptidomimetics able to mimic the ability of G proteins in stabilizing the active state of the &#946;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adrenergic receptor (&#946;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AR) and the dopamine 1 receptor (D1R). During fragment&#8208;based screening efforts, these (un)constrained peptide analogues of the &#945;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; helix in G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; proteins, were able to identify agonism pre&#8208;imprinted fragments for the examined GPCRs, and as such, they behave as a generic tool, enabling an engagement in agonist earmarked discovery programs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Homochiral Radical Cage with Paramagnetic Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homochiral radical cage containing four spin centers was self&#8208;assembled in high yield by imine condensation in a one&#8208;pot manner, without purification. Intramolecular interactions such as [CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] and hydrogen&#8208;bonding endow the cage with stable homochirality. Magnetic measurements demonstrated that the tetra&#8208;radical cage exhibits a typical spin&#8208;half paramagnetic behavior with a spin concentration of 3.58 spins/cage, indicating that each radical within a cage is weakly coupled.







Abstract
Condensation of an inherently C3&#8208;symmetric polychlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) radical trisaldehyde with tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (TREN) yields a [4+4] tetrahedral radical cage as a racemic pair of homochiral enantiomers in 75&#8201;% isolated yield. The structure was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, confirming the homochirality of each cage framework. The homochirality results from intramolecular [CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions within the cage framework. The four PTM radicals in a cage undergo weak through&#8208;space coupling. Magnetic measurements demonstrated that each cage bears 3.58 spins.

         <title>The Protein Corona Leads to Deformation of Spherical Micelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fructose&#8208;based block copolymer was self&#8208;assembled into four different micelles with various shell polymer densities. The most brush&#8208;like micelle was observed to have the highest amount of protein adsorption and the lowest cellular uptake. Small angle scattering revealed that the protein corona transformed the spherical micelles into spheroidal micelles and the nanoparticles used in the biological experiment were therefore non&#8208;spherical.







Abstract
The formation of a non&#8208;specific protein corona around nanoparticles (NPs) has been identified as one of the culprits for failed nanomedicine. The amount and type of adsorbed protein from the blood plasma are known to determine the fate of NPs and the accessibility of targeting ligands. Herein, we show that the adsorbed protein may not only enlarge the NPs and change their surface properties but also, in the case of soft NPs such as polymer micelles, lead to deformation. Poly(1&#8208;O&#8208;methacryloyl &#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;fructopyranose)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(methylmethacrylate) (P(1&#8208;O&#8208;MAFru)&#8208;b&#8208;PMMA) block co&#8208;polymers were self&#8208;assembled into NPs with a spherical core&#8211;shell morphology as determined by small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Upon incubation with albumin, TEM, SANS, and small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) revealed the adsorption of albumin and deformation of the NPs with a spheroid geometry. Removal of the protein led to the reversal of the morphology back to the spherical core&#8211;shell structure. Structural studies and cell studies of uptake of the NPs imply that the observed deformation may influence blood circulation time and cell uptake.

         <title>Activation of 2&#8208;Cyclohexenone by BF3 Coordination: Mechanistic Insights from Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis acid complex of 2&#8208;cyclohexenone and BF3 relaxes to the active triplet state after photoexcitation in less than a picosecond. This process can be followed by XMS&#8208;CASPT2 dynamics and transient absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
Lewis acids have recently been recognized as catalysts enabling enantioselective photochemical transformations. Mechanistic studies on these systems are however rare, either due to their absorption at wavelengths shorter than 260&#8197;nm, or due to the limitations of theoretical dynamic studies for larger complexes. In this work, we overcome these challenges and employ sub&#8208;30&#8208;fs transient absorption in the UV, in combination with a highly accurate theoretical treatment on the XMS&#8208;CASPT2 level. We investigate 2&#8208;cyclohexenone and its complex to boron trifluoride and analyze the observed dynamics based on trajectory calculations including non&#8208;adiabatic coupling and intersystem crossing. This approach explains all ultrafast decay pathways observed in the complex. We show that the Lewis acid remains attached to the substrate in the triplet state, which in turn explains why chiral boron&#8208;based Lewis acids induce a high enantioselectivity in photocycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Pseudo Natural Products&#8212;Chemical Evolution of Natural Product Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;Natural Products provide new opportunities in the discovery of bioactive small molecules and can be regarded as a human&#8208;driven chemical evolution of natural product structure.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;natural products (PNPs) combine natural product (NP) fragments in novel arrangements not accessible by current biosynthesis pathways. As such they can be regarded as non&#8208;biogenic fusions of NP&#8208;derived fragments. They inherit key biological characteristics of the guiding natural product, such as chemical and physiological properties, yet define small molecule chemotypes with unprecedented or unexpected bioactivity. We iterate the design principles underpinning PNP scaffolds and highlight their syntheses and biological investigations. We provide a cheminformatic analysis of PNP collections assessing their molecular properties and shape diversity. We propose and discuss how the iterative analysis of NP structure, design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of PNPs can be regarded as a human&#8208;driven branch of the evolution of natural products, that is, a chemical evolution of natural product structure.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Liquids Based on Siloxybinaphthyls: Best Binaphthyl Dihedral Angle in the Excited State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) neat liquids based on siloxybinaphthyls were developed. The position of the substitution has a crucial effect on the CPL activity and liquefaction. In the excited state, the binaphthyls specifically adopt a transoid conformation with a dihedral angle of 121&#176;, which is close to the best binaphthyl dihedral angle for the high CPL activity.







Abstract
A series of axially chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyls with trialkylsiloxy (OSiR3) groups were synthesized. Among them, 1&#8201;a&#8211;c possessing OSiR3 groups at the 7,7&#8242;&#8208;positions and methyl groups at the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;positions were liquids at room temperature, and the neat liquids showed circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) (R=Bu; &#934;fl,liquid=0.21, |glum,liquid|=1.6&#215;10&#8722;3). The |glum,liquid| value is the highest of pure liquids. These compounds remained liquid over a broad range of temperatures, down to &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C. Time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations indicated that in the excited state, the binaphthyls adopt a transoid conformation with a small angle between the electric and magnetic transition dipole moments (&#952;&#956;,m=77&#176;), which is a key factor in their CPL activity. The best binaphthyl dihedral angle in the excited state is approximately 110&#176;.

         <title>Construction of Inorganic Crown Ethers by s&#8208;Block&#8208;Metal&#8208;Templated Si&#8722;O Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;silicon versions of crown ethers were isolated and characterized. These silicon&#8208;based macrocycles are obtained from 2D2/s&#8208;block metaliodide/gallium(III)&#8208;iodide (2D2=(Me4Si2O)2) Lewis&#8208;acid systems which enable s&#8208;block metal templated Si&#8722;O bond activation and subsequent oligomerization. The coordination ability of these macrocycles is evaluated and a mechanism of formation is suggested by means of DFT calculations.







Abstract
We herein report the synthesis, structures, coordination ability, and mechanism of formation of silicon analogs of crown ethers. An oligomerization of 2D2 (I) (2Dn,=(Me4Si2O)n) was achieved by the reaction with GaI3 and MIx (M=Li, Na, Mg, Ca, Sr). In these reactions the metal cations serve as template and the anions (I&#8722;/[GaI4]&#8722;) are required as nucleophiles. In case of MIx=LiI, [Li(2D3)GaI4] (1) is formed. In case of MIx=NaI, MgI2, CaI2, and SrI2 the compounds [M(2D4)(GaI4)x] (M=Mg2+ (3), Ca2+ (4), Sr2+ (5) are obtained. Furthermore the proton complex [H(2D3)][Ga2I7] (6) was isolated and structurally characterized. All complexes were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, DOSY experiments and, except for compound 3, also by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Quantum chemical calculations were carried out to compare the affinity of M+ to 2Dn and other ligands and to shed light on the formation of larger rings from smaller ones.

         <title>Assembly of a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane on Solid Electrocatalyst: Introducing Molecular&#8208;Level Control Over Heterogeneous CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemically active Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have been progressively recognized for their use in solar fuel production schemes. Typically, they are utilized as platforms for heterogeneous tethering of exceptionally large concentration of molecular electrocatalysts onto electrodes. Yet so far, the potential influence of their extraordinary chemical modularity on electrocatalysis has been overlooked. Herein, we demonstrate that, when assembled on a solid Ag CO2 reduction electrocatalyst, a non&#8208;catalytic UiO&#8208;66 MOF acts as a porous membrane that systematically tunes the active site&#8217;s immediate chemical environment, leading to a drastic enhancement of electrocatalytic activity and selectivity. Electrochemical analysis shows that the MOF membrane improves catalytic performance through physical and electrostatic regulation of reactants delivery towards the catalytic sites. The MOF also stabilizes catalytic intermediates via modulation of active site&#8217;s secondary coordination sphere. This concept can be expanded to a wide range of proton&#8208;coupled electrochemical reactions, providing new means for precise, molecular&#8208;level manipulation of heterogeneous solar fuels systems.</dc:description>

         <title>New high&#8208;performance porous ionic liquids for low pressure CO2 capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous ionic liquids are non volatile, versatile materials that associate porosity and fluidity. New porous ionic liquids, based on the ZIF&#8208;8 metal&#8208;organic framework and on phosphonium acetate or levulinate salts, were prepared and show an increased capacity to absorb carbon dioxide at low pressures. Porous suspensions based on phosphonium levulinate ionic liquid absorb reversibly 103% more carbon dioxide per mass than pure ZIF&#8208;8 per mass at 1bar and 303K . We show how the rational combination of MOFs with ionic liquids can greatly enhance low pressure CO 2 absorption, paving the way toward a new generation of high&#8208;performance, readily available liquid materials for effective low pressure carbon capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon dots based white light&#8208;emitting diodes with adjustable correlated color temperature guided by machine learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) have attracted extensive attention in white light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) research due to their inherent optical advantages, such as emission wavelength tunability, high quantum yield (QY) and low photobleaching properties. However, their wide emission spectrum and the electron transfer between CDs make the fabrication of their light&#8208;emitting devices very complicated and difficult. Here, we show the fabrication of the CDs with green and orange emissions from PTCDA (perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride). Using these CDs as emitters, the orange (or green) CDs LEDs were fabricated, which show electroluminescence (EL) spectra centered at 560 nm (or 498 nm) with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.98% (1.76%) adhering a luminescence of 626 cd/m2 (or 519 cd/m2). We successfully constructed the machine learning model to predict PL CCT value. With the model, we achieve white photoluminescence (PL) emission with adjustable correlated color temperature (CCT) from 3093 to 11018 K via combining blue, green and orange CDs. We obtain the warm white CDs LEDs with CCT of 3107, 4071 and 4548 K, and cold white CDs LEDs with CCT of 5632 (CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33), EQE: 1.18%, luminescence: 598 cd/m2) and 6034 K accurately.</dc:description>

         <title>An Affinity&#8208;Based, Cysteine&#8208;Specific ATP Analog for Kinase&#8208;Catalyzed Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Characterization of kinase&#8211;substrate pairs is an enabling strategy to understand kinase&#8208;related diseases and identify new drug targets. An affinity&#8208;based kinase&#8208;dependent crosslinker, ATP&#8208;MAc, is introduced to capture kinase&#8211;substrate interactions under physiological conditions. Unlike prior ATP&#8208;photocrosslinking analogs, ATP&#8208;MAc covalently links only cysteine&#8208;containing kinases with their substrates without the need for UV light.







Abstract
Kinases mediate cell signaling pathways by catalyzing protein phosphorylation. Irregularities in kinase activity are directly associated with disease conditions. Therefore, methods to identify substrates of a particular kinase are needed to understand signaling cascades in normal and diseased states. Photocrosslinking ATP analogs provide powerful tools to study kinases by covalently linking kinases with substrates. However, the involvement of UV light and nonspecific reactivity of current ATP&#8208;photocrosslinkers challenge kinase&#8211;substrate identification. We report here an affinity&#8208;based crosslinking ATP analog, ATP&#8208;methylacrylamide (ATP&#8208;MAc), that contains a cysteine&#8208;reactive acrylamide crosslinking group, which avoids the UV irradiation and non&#8208;specific reactivity of prior analogs. Using in&#8197;vitro kinase assays, ATP&#8208;MAc acts as a kinase co&#8208;substrate and covalently crosslinks only kinases containing cysteines in the active site. ATP&#8208;MAc was also able to crosslink cellular proteins in lysates, documenting compatibility with cell&#8208;based studies.

         <title>Liposomes as Carriers of Membrane&#8208;Associated Proteins and Peptides for Mass Spectrometric Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteoliposome carriers for mass spectrometric analysis of membrane&#8208;associated proteins and peptides enable the investigation of lipid clusters, protein oligomers, and protein&#8211;lipid interactions. This approach is versatile, applicable to many peripheral membrane proteins/peptides, and can be linked with functional assays.







Abstract
Membrane proteins are key players of the cell. Their structure and the interactions they form with their lipid environment are required to understand their function. Here we explore liposomes as membrane mimetics for mass spectrometric analysis of peripheral membrane proteins and peptides. Liposomes are advantageous over other membrane mimetics in that they are easy to prepare, can be varied in size and composition, and are suitable for functional assays. We demonstrate that they dissociate into lipid clusters in the gas phase of a mass spectrometer while intact protein and protein&#8211;lipid complexes are retained. We exemplify this approach by employing different liposomes including proteoliposomes of two model peptides/proteins differing in size. Our results pave the way for the general application of liposomes for mass spectrometric analysis of membrane&#8208;associated proteins.

         <title>Probing Physical Oxidation State by Resonant X&#8208;ray Emission Spectroscopy: Applications to Iron Model Complexes and Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assigning transition&#8208;metal physical oxidation states is a major goal of X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. However, competing influences of covalency and d&#8208;count on K&#946; XES spectra often make assignments ambiguous. It is now shown that resonant K&#946; X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (RXES) yields unambiguous oxidation&#8208;state determinations for iron monomers, dimers, cubanes, and metalloenzymes.







Abstract
The ability of resonant X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (XES) to recover physical oxidation state information, which may often be ambiguous in conventional X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, is demonstrated. By combining K&#946; XES with resonant excitation in the XAS pre&#8208;edge region, resonant K&#946; XES (or 1s3p RXES) data are obtained, which probe the 3dn+1 final&#8208;state configuration. Comparison of the non&#8208;resonant and resonant XES for a series of high&#8208;spin ferrous and ferric complexes shows that oxidation state assignments that were previously unclear are now easily made. The present study spans iron tetrachlorides, iron sulfur clusters, and the MoFe protein of nitrogenase. While 1s3p RXES studies have previously been reported, to our knowledge, 1s3p RXES has not been previously utilized to resolve questions of metal valency in highly covalent systems. As such, the approach presented herein provides chemists with means to more rigorously and quantitatively address challenging electronic&#8208;structure questions.

         <title>A SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Binding DNA Aptamer that Inhibits Pseudovirus Infection by an RBD&#8208;Independent Mechanism**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SP6 is a DNA aptamer binding to the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein and inhibits pseudovirus infection of cells. As the aptamer does not interfere with the CoV&#8208;2S ACE2 receptor binding domain, it provides an RBD&#8208;independent mechanism of virus inhibition.







Abstract
The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of the coronavirus SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (CoV2&#8208;S) binds to the human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) representing the initial contact point for leveraging the infection cascade. We used an automated selection process and identified an aptamer that specifically interacts with CoV2&#8208;S. The aptamer does not bind to the RBD of CoV2&#8208;S and does not block the interaction of CoV2&#8208;S with ACE2. Nevertheless, infection studies revealed potent and specific inhibition of pseudoviral infection by the aptamer. The present study opens up new vistas in developing SARS&#8208;CoV2 infection inhibitors, independent of blocking the ACE2 interaction of the virus, and harnesses aptamers as potential drug candidates and tools to disentangle hitherto inaccessible infection modalities, which is of particular interest in light of the increasing number of escape mutants that are currently being reported.

         <title>Antitumor Agents Based on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design principles and structure&#8211;function relationships of antitumor agents based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks are summarized, and the current challenges and opportunities are also discussed.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise for biomedical applications owing to their unique properties. The porous structures make MOFs excellent candidates for the delivery of different drugs; the flexibility in choosing metal ions and organic ligands makes it feasible to prepare MOFs with intrinsic antitumor activities and further devise MOF&#8211;drug synergistic systems; many other types of antitumor agents could also be developed using MOFs as the precursors/templates. Thus, the past two decades have witnessed the great development of MOF&#8208;based drugs, especially in the antitumor field. This Minireview mainly focuses on the design and applications of MOF&#8208;based antitumor agents. Four aspects covering the whole field are introduced: MOFs as carriers, MOFs as antitumor agents, MOF&#8211;drug synergistic systems, and MOF&#8208;derived antitumor agents. The challenges and opportunities of MOFs for clinical antitumor applications are also discussed.

         <dc:description>
An inverse sandwich&#8208;type cluster dimer of [K(2,2,2&#8208;crypt)]4{[K2ZnSn8(ZnMes)]2} was synthesized. The highly charged [Sn8]6&#8722; is captured by mixed&#8208;valence ZnI/ZnII to form the closo&#8208;[Zn2Sn8] bridged by a ZnI&#8208;ZnI bond. The Zn&#8211;Sn compound not only indicates the [Sn8]6&#8722; can act as a novel bridging ligand like arene, but shows the interdisciplinary integration of cluster chemistry and zinc chemistry.







Abstract
Since [Sn8]6&#8722; was discovered from the solid&#8208;state phase in 2000, its solution chemistry has been elusive due to the high charges and chemical activity. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of an inverse sandwich&#8208;type cluster dimer {[K2ZnSn8(ZnMes)]2}4&#8722; (1&#8201;a), in which the highly charged [Sn8]6&#8722; is captured by mixed&#8208;valence ZnI/ZnII to form the dimer {closo&#8208;[Zn2Sn8]}2 moieties bridged by a Zn&#8208;Zn bond. Such Zn&#8208;Sn cluster not only exhibits a novel example of mixed&#8208;valence ZnI/ZnII for stabilizing highly active anion species, but also indicates the [Sn8]6&#8722; cluster can act as a novel bridging ligand, like arene, with a &#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;fashion. Theoretical calculations indicate that a significant delocalization of electrons over Zn atoms plays a vital role in the stabilization of the [Sn8]6&#8722; species. The AdNDP and magnetic response analyses clearly showed the presence of local &#963;&#8208;aromaticity in three cluster fragments: two ZnSn4 caps and Sn8 square antiprism.

         <title>New Synthetic Approaches to N&#8208;Aryl and &#960;&#8208;Expanded Diketopyrrolopyrroles as New Building Blocks for Organic Optoelectronic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new easily handled synthetic method toward N&#8208;aryl DPPs was reported through the reaction of H&#8208;DPP with diaryliodonium salt in the presence of CuI. The N&#8208;aryl DPPs are fluorescent in solutions and solid states. Furthermore, the reaction can lead to &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs by using Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst. These &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs exhibit good semiconducting properties, demonstrating their potential applications in organic semiconductors of high performance.







Abstract
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as a building block has been intensively investigated for organic semiconductors and light emitting materials. The synthesis of N&#8208;aryl DPPs remains challenging. Herein, we firstly report a new easily handled synthetic method toward N&#8208;aryl DPPs through H&#8208;DPP with diaryliodonium salt in the presence of CuI, which shows broad reaction scope. Sixteen N&#8208;aryl DPPs, including phenyl, furan and thiophene as flanking aromatic groups, were synthesized with yields up to 78&#8201;%. These N&#8208;aryl DPPs are fluorescent in both solutions and solid states, with quantum yields up to 96&#8201;% and 40&#8201;%, respectively. Moreover, we show that the reaction between H&#8208;DPP and diaryliodonium salt can lead to &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs by using Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst. Nine &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs were obtained in 27&#8211;61&#8201;% yields. These &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs exhibit good semiconducting properties with hole mobility of 0.71&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, demonstrating that they are useful building blocks for high performance organic semiconductors.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Responsive Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composite Membranes for CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart two&#8208;dimensional composite membranes containing flexible metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MONs) and graphene oxide nanosheets are developed for pressure&#8208;responsive CO2 separations through a CO2&#8208;induced &#8220;gate opening&#8221; effect. Huge jumps of CO2 permeance and CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity occur above the gate&#8208;opening pressure of the flexible MONs, indicating a stimulus&#8208;responsive behavior with greatly enhanced CO2 separation performance.







Abstract
The regulation of permeance and selectivity in membrane systems may allow effective relief of conventional energy&#8208;intensive separations. Here, pressure&#8208;responsive ultrathin membranes (&#8776;100&#8197;nm) fabricated by compositing flexible two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MONs) with graphene oxide nanosheets for CO2 separation are reported. By controlling the gas permeation direction to leverage the pressure&#8208;responsive phase transition of the MONs, CO2&#8208;induced gate opening and closing behaviors are observed in the resultant membranes, which are accompanied with the sharp increase of CO2 permeance (from 173.8 to 1144 gas permeation units) as well as CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivities (from 4.1 to 22.8 and from 4 to 19.6, respectively). The flexible behaviors and separation mechanism are further elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations. This work establishes the relevance of structural transformation&#8208;based framework dynamics chemistry in smart membrane systems.

         <title>Chiral Dibenzopentalene&#8208;Based Conjugated Nanohoops through Stereoselective Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral, dibenzo[a,e]pentalene&#8208;based conjugated nanohoops were synthesized in a stereoselective way from enantiomerically pure diketone precursors. The hoop shows ambipolar electrochemical behavior due to the antiaromaticity of the dibenzopentalene units and can accommodate two fullerene molecules. Circular dichroism measurements and molecular dynamics simulations indicated no racemization even at 110&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Conjugated nanohoops allow to investigate the effect of radial conjugation and bending on the involved &#960;&#8208;systems. They can possess unexpected optoelectronic properties and their radially oriented &#960;&#8208;system makes them attractive for host&#8211;guest chemistry. Bending the &#960;&#8208;subsystems can lead to chiral hoops. Herein, we report the stereoselective synthesis of two enantiomers of chiral conjugated nanohoops by incorporating dibenzo[a,e]pentalenes (DBPs), which are generated in the last synthetic step from enantiomerically pure diketone precursors. Owing to its bent shape, this diketone unit was used as the only bent precursor and novel &#8220;corner unit&#8221; in the synthesis of the hoops. The [6]DBP[4]Ph&#8208;hoops contain six antiaromatic DBP units and four bridging phenylene groups. The small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and ambipolar electrochemical character of the DBP units is reflected in the optoelectronic properties of the hoop. Electronic circular dichroism spectra and MD simulations showed that the chiral hoop did not racemize even when heated to 110 &#176;C. Due to its large diameter, it was able to accommodate two C60 molecules, as binding studies indicate.

         <title>Stereoselective and Stereospecific Triflate&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Schmidt Reaction: Ready Access to Alkaloid Skeletons**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiomerically enriched azabicyclic compounds found in several important families of alkaloids can be prepared by a remarkably stereospecific and stereoselective intramolecular Schmidt reaction. The initial asymmetric alcohol center controls the whole process, leading to the formation of one out of up to four possible diastereoisomers with inversion of the configuration at the original asymmetric center.







Abstract
The stereoselectivity and stereospecificity of the triflate&#8208;mediated intramolecular Schmidt reaction of substituted 3&#8208;(1&#8208;azidocyclohexyl)propanol derivatives leading to octahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]azepine, the structural skeleton of several important families of alkaloids such as the Stemona alkaloids, has been examined. The reaction involves an initial intramolecular SN2 reaction between the azide moiety and the triflate affording an intermediate spirocyclic aminodiazonoium salt that undergoes the expected 1,2&#8208;shift/N2&#8208;elimination followed by hydride&#8208;mediated iminium salt reduction. Remarkably, chiral alcohols are converted to the azabicyclic derivative with no or limited racemization. The initial asymmetric alcohol center controls the diastereoselectivity of the whole process, leading to the formation of one out of the four possible diastereoisomers of disubstituted octahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]azepine. The origin of the stereoselectivity is rationalized based on theoretical calculations. The concise synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;(cis)&#8208;3&#8208;propylindolizidine and (&#8722;)&#8208;(cis)&#8208;3&#8208;butyllehmizidine, two alkaloids found in the venom of workers of the ant Myrmicaria melanogaster, is reported.

         <title>Organosulfide&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) induced by the Li&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interaction between 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl disulfide (DpyDS) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) is reported. The strong ion&#8208;dipole interaction triggers the deep eutectic phenomenon, thus liberating the Li+ from LiTFSI and endowing the DEE with promising ionic conductivity. The DEE exhibits nonflammable nature and was successfully applied in a Li/LiFePO4 half cell.







Abstract
Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) are a new class of electrolytes with unique properties. However, the intermolecular interactions of DEEs are mostly dominated by Li&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions, limiting the diversity of chemical space and material constituents. Herein, we report a new class of DEEs induced by Li&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions between 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl disulfide (DpyDS) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI).

&lt;p&gt;A new class of deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) induced by the Li&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interaction between 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl disulfide (DpyDS) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) is reported. The strong ion&#8208;dipole interaction triggers the deep eutectic phenomenon, thus liberating the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from LiTFSI and endowing the DEE with promising ionic conductivity. The DEE exhibits nonflammable nature and was successfully applied in a Li/LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; half cell.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) are a new class of electrolytes with unique properties. However, the intermolecular interactions of DEEs are mostly dominated by Li&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions, limiting the diversity of chemical space and material constituents. Herein, we report a new class of DEEs induced by Li&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions between 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl disulfide (DpyDS) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). The strong ion&#8208;dipole interaction triggers the deep eutectic phenomenon, thus liberating the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from LiTFSI and endowing the DEEs with promising ionic conductivity. These DEEs show admirable intrinsic safety, which cannot be ignited by flame. The DEE at the molar ratio of DpyDS:LiTFSI=4:1 (abbreviated as DEE&#8208;4:1) is electrochemically stable between 2.1 and 4.0&#8197;V vs. Li/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and exhibits an ionic conductivity of 1.5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 50&#8201;&#176;C. The Li/LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; half cell with DEE&#8208;4:1 can provide a reversible capacity of 130&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and Coulombic efficiency above 98&#8201;% at 50&#8201;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release Driven Spirocyclization of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their intrinsic rigidity, three&#8208;dimensionality and structural novelty, spirocyclic molecules have become increasingly sought&#8208;after moieties in drug discovery. Herein, we report a strain&#8208;release driven synthesis of azetidine&#8208;containing spirocycles by harnessing the inherent ring strain of the azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane (ABB) fragment. Novel ABB&#8208;ketone precursors bearing silyl&#8208;protected alcohols were synthesised in a single step and shown to engage in electrophile&#8208;induced spirocyclization&#8208;desilylation reactions. Primary, secondary and tertiary silyl ethers were effectively transformed into a library of new spiro&#8208;azetidines, with a range of substituents and ring sizes. In addition, the products are generated with synthetically useful ketone and protected&#8208;amine functional groups, which provides the potential for further elaboration and for this chemistry to be utilized in the rapid assembly of medicinally relevant compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Mobility in the Interfacial Liquid Layer of Ice/Clay Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7697-7702, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using quasi&#8208;elastic neutron scattering (QENS), the mobility of water molecules confined in the premelting layer of three different ice/clay nanocomposites is quantified. Layers of low&#8208;density liquid water are formed adjacent to ice&#8197;Ih and clay mineral interfaces. This leads to a reduction of the translational diffusion coefficient within the premelting layer.







Abstract
At solid/ice interfaces, a premelting layer is formed at temperatures below the melting point of bulk water. However, the structural and dynamic properties within the premelting layer have been a topic of intense debate. Herein, we determined the translational diffusion coefficient Dt of water in ice/clay nanocomposites serving as model systems for permafrost by quasi&#8208;elastic neutron scattering. Below the bulk melting point, a rapid decrease of Dt is found for charged hydrophilic vermiculite, uncharged hydrophilic kaolin, and more hydrophobic talc, reaching plateau values below &#8722;4&#8201;&#176;C. At this temperature, Dt in the premelting layer is reduced up to a factor of two compared to supercooled bulk water. Adjacent to charged vermiculite the lowest water mobility was observed, followed by kaolin and the more hydrophobic talc. Results are explained by the intermolecular water interactions with different clay surfaces and interfacial segregation of the low&#8208;density liquid water (LDL) component.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Mycinolide&#8197;IV and Path&#8208;Scouting for Aldgamycin&#8197;N</title>

Dozens of macrolide antibiotics are known that differ from each other only in the decoration of an otherwise highly conserved 16&#8208;membered lactone core and in the lateral glycosylation pattern. A unified approach was explored that holds the promise of bringing numerous members of this type into reach from a single &#8220;eastern&#8221; building block.







Abstract
Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept is provided that a large estate of 16&#8208;membered macrolide antibiotics can be reached by a &#8220;unified&#8221; approach. The key building block was formed on scale by an asymmetric vinylogous Mukaiyama aldol reaction; its alkene terminus was then converted either into the corresponding methyl ketone by Wacker oxidation or into a chain&#8208;extended aldehyde by catalyst&#8208;controlled branch&#8208;selective asymmetric hydroformylation. These transformations ultimately opened access to two structurally distinct series of macrolide targets. Notable late&#8208;stage maneuvers comprise a rare example of a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed redox isomerization of an 1,3&#8208;enyne&#8208;5&#8208;ol into a 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;5&#8208;one derivative, as well as the elaboration of a tertiary propargylic alcohol into an acyloin by trans&#8208;hydrostannation/Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;type coupling. Moreover, this case study illustrates the underutilized possibility of forging complex macrolactone rings by transesterification under essentially neutral conditions.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced 1,3&#8208;Aminopyridylation of [1.1.1]Propellane with N&#8208;Aminopyridinium Salts</title>

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced aminopyridylation of propellane by photoabsorbing electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes has been developed by employing N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as bifunctional reagents. This strategy can be extended to P&#8208;centered and CF3 radicals for the direct incorporation of these functional groups across the bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) core, thus enabling straightforward construction of valuable pyridine&#8208;containing BCP chemical entities.







Abstract
Through the formation of an electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex, strain&#8208;release aminopyridylation of [1.1.1]propellane with N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as bifunctional reagents enabled the direct installation of amino and pyridyl groups onto bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) frameworks in the absence of an external photocatalyst. The robustness of this method to synthesize 1,3&#8208;aminopyridylated BCPs under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage modification of structurally complex biorelevant molecules. Moreover, the strategy was extended to P&#8208;centered and CF3 radicals for the unprecedented incorporation of such functional groups with pyridine across the BCP core in a three&#8208;component coupling. This practical method lays the foundation for the straightforward construction of new valuable C4&#8208;pyridine&#8208;functionalized BCP chemical entities, thus significantly expanding the range of accessibility of BCP&#8208;type bioisosteres for applications in drug discovery.

A resplendent trio: Protic ionic liquids (PILs) with nucleophilic anions served in concert as regenerable reaction medium, Br&#248;nsted acid, and a source of nucleophile. Heating of donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes with 1&#8208;methylimidazolium thiocyanate (B:&#8901;HNCS) afforded products of formal (3+2)&#8208; and (4+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of isothiocyanic acid.







Abstract
We propose a new concept of the triple role of protic ionic liquids with nucleophilic anions: a) a regenerable solvent, b) a Br&#248;nsted acid inducing diverse transformations via general acid catalysis, and c) a source of a nucleophile. The efficiency of this strategy was demonstrated using thiocyanate&#8208;based protic ionic liquids for the ring&#8208;opening of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes. A wide variety of activated cyclopropanes were found to react with 1&#8208;methylimidazolium thiocyanate under mild metal&#8208;free conditions via unusual nitrogen attack of the ambident thiocyanate ion on the electrophilic center of the three&#8208;membered ring affording pyrrolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thiones bearing donor and acceptor substituents at the C(5) and C(3) atoms, respectively, in a single time&#8208;efficient step. The ability of 1&#8208;methylimidazolium thiocyanate to serve as a triplex reagent was exemplarily illustrated by (4+2)&#8208;annulation with 1&#8208;acyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)cyclopropane, epoxide ring&#8208;opening and other organic transformations.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Adsorption&#8208;Driven Mechanism for MOFs&#8208;Based Yolk&#8211;Shell Nanostructures</title>

MOFs&#8208;based yolk&#8211;shell nanostructures (ZIF&#8208;8@mSiO2) are controllably synthesized via a solvent&#8208;dependent adsorption&#8208;driven mechanism. The ZIF&#8208;8@mSiO2 structures exhibit excellent sonodynamic performance for generating reactive oxygen species under acoustic cavitation.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;based yolk&#8211;shell nanostructures have drawn enormous attention recently due to their multifunctionality. However, the regulations of the size and morphology of yolk&#8211;shell nanostructures are still limited by the unclear formation mechanism. Herein, we first demonstrated a solvent&#8208;dependent adsorption&#8208;driven mechanism for synthesizing yolk&#8211;shelled MOFs&#8208;based nanostructures coated with mesoporous SiO2 shells (ZIF&#8208;8@mSiO2) with tunable size and morphology. The selective and competitive adsorption of methanol (CH3OH) and water (H2O) on ZIF&#8208;8 core were found to have decisive effects on inducing the morphology evolution of yolk&#8211;shell nanostructures. The obtained yolk&#8211;shelled ZIF&#8208;8@mSiO2 nanostructures show great promise in generating acoustic cavitation effect for sonodynamic cancer therapy in vitro. We believe that this work will not only help us to design novel MOFs&#8208;based yolk&#8211;shell nanostructures, but also promote the widespread application of MOFs materials.

         <title>Scalable De Novo Synthesis of Aldgarose and Total Synthesis of Aldgamycin&#8197;N</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7900-7905, March 29, 2021. </description>

One sugar has to be attached before the transannular ketone is revealed from an alkyne precursor to render the first successful total synthesis ever of a member of the aldgamycin family of antibiotics. Although this phasing of events implies that the precious branched monosaccharide must be carried through several steps, a practical and scalable synthesis of the required aldgarose fragment greatly mitigates the &#8220;cost&#8221; of this strategy.







Abstract
Since the accompanying study had shown that the introduction of the eponymous aldgarose sugar to the C5&#8208;OH group of the macrocyclic aglycone of aldgamycin N is most difficult, if not even impossible, the synthesis route was revised and the glycosidation performed at an earlier stage. To mitigate the &#8220;cost&#8221; of this strategic amendment, a practical and scalable de novo synthesis of this branched octose was developed. The glycoside formation required mild conditions; it commenced with the reaction of the aglycone with the trichloroacetimidate donor to give a transient orthoester, which slowly rearranged to the desired aldgaropyranoside. The presence of the polar peripheral groups in the product did not impede the selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of the macrolide ring itself: the contained propargylic alcohol entity was readily transformed into the characteristic acyloin motif of the target by a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed trans&#8208;hydrostannation followed by a modified Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;type coupling.

         <title>Anomalous Cis&#8208;Conformation Regioselectivity of Heterocycle&#8208;Fused Sc3N@D3h&#8208;C78 Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7880-7886, March 29, 2021. </description>

Sc3N@D3h&#8208;C78 was reacted with carbonyl ylide to form two isomeric monoadducts 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b bearing anomalous cis&#8208;conformation regioselectivity and a [6,6]&#8208;closed addition pattern. Whereas isomeric monoadducts 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b with cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;conformations were produced simultaneously for C60 under the same conditions. Adduct stability, reactivity of the addition site, and the nature of intermediates play a role in the different regioselectivity.







Abstract
Endohedral clusterfullerenes exhibit unique chemical properties due to intramolecular electron transfer of the encaged metal cluster to the outer fullerene cages. We report the synthesis of two Sc3N@D3h&#8208;C78 monoadducts 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b through the 1,3&#8208;dipolar reaction of Sc3N@D3h&#8208;C78 with carbonyl ylide bearing anomalous cis&#8208;conformation regioselectivity. The molecular structures of these monoadducts are unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, revealing that both 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b have cis&#8208;conformations with the furan moiety grafted via [6,6]&#8208;closed addition patterns. Under the same conditions, the control reaction of C60 with carbonyl ylide affords two monoadducts 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b, which exhibit cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;conformations, respectively, with [6,6]&#8208;closed addition patterns. According to theoretical calculations, the exclusive formation of the cis&#8208;only Sc3N@D3h&#8208;C78 monoadducts is a consequence of conjunct effects of thermodynamic stability of adducts, the reactivity of the addition site, and the cis&#8208;dipole intermediate from trans 1.

         <title>Cooperative Syngas Production and C&#8722;N Bond Formation in One Photoredox Cycle</title>

         <dc:description>
A function&#8208;oriented strategy of engineering black phosphorus quantum dots&#8208;ZnIn2S4 heterostructures for solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to syngas, paired with selectively oxidative C&#8722;N bond formation, in one redox cycle is reported. The promoted charge&#8208;carrier separation, enriched active sites and optimized adsorption strength of key reaction intermediates for CO2 reduction, as well as the cooperative photoredox manner, jointly contribute to the enhanced photoactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven syngas production by CO2 reduction provides a sustainable strategy to produce renewable feedstocks. However, this promising reaction often suffers from tough CO2 activation, sluggish oxidative half&#8208;reaction kinetics and undesired by&#8208;products. Herein, we report a function&#8208;oriented strategy of deliberately constructing black phosphorus quantum dots&#8208;ZnIn2S4 (BP/ZIS) heterostructures for solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to syngas, paired with selectively oxidative C&#8722;N bond formation, in one redox cycle. The optimal BP/ZIS heterostructure features the enhanced charge&#8208;carrier separation and enriched active sites for cooperatively photocatalytic syngas production with a tunable ratio of CO/H2 and efficient oxidation of amines to imines with high conversion and selectivity. This prominent catalytic performance arises from the efficient electronic coupling between black phosphorus quantum dots and ZnIn2S4, as well as the optimized adsorption strength for key reaction intermediates, as supported by both experimental and theoretical investigations. We also demonstrate a synergistic interplay between CO2 reduction and amine dehydrogenation oxidation, rather than simply collecting these two single half&#8208;reactions in this dual&#8208;functional photoredox system.

         <title>Spectroscopic Evidence of Hyponitrite Radical Intermediate in NO Disproportionation at a MOF&#8208;Supported Mononuclear Copper Site</title>

A radical N2O2.&#8722; intermediate formed during a nitric oxide reductive coupling reaction was captured at a copper center in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). Strict site isolation in the solid state is key in stabilizing this intermediate.







Abstract
Dianionic hyponitrite (N2O22&#8722;) is often proposed, based on model complexes, as the key intermediate in reductive coupling of nitric oxide to nitrous oxide at the bimetallic active sites of heme&#8208;copper oxidases and nitric oxide reductases. In this work, we examine the gas&#8208;solid reaction of nitric oxide with the metal&#8211;organic framework CuI&#8208;ZrTpmC* with a suite of in situ spectroscopies and density functional theory simulations, and identify an unusual chelating N2O2.&#8722; intermediate. These results highlight the advantage provided by site&#8208;isolation in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for studying important reaction intermediates, and provide a mechanistic scenario compatible with the proposed one&#8208;electron couple in these enzymes.

         <title>The Formation/Decomposition Equilibrium of LiH and its Contribution on Anode Failure in Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7770-7776, March 29, 2021. </description>

On&#8208;line D2O titration on a Li anode suggests that the amount of LiH accumulation is negatively correlated with cyclability of practical lithium metal batteries. It is revealed that a temperature&#8208;sensitive equilibrium (Li + 1/2&#8201;H2 &#8652; LiH) governs formation and decomposition process of LiH at Li anodes.







Abstract
Discovering the underlying reason for Li anode failure is a critical step towards applications of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). In this work, we conduct deuterium&#8208;oxide (D2O) titration experiments in a novel on&#8208;line gas analysis mass spectrometry (MS) system, to determine the content of metallic Li and lithium hydride (LiH) in cycled Li anodes disassembled from practical LiCoO2/Li LMBs. The practical cell is comprised of ultrathin Li anode (50&#8197;&#956;m), high loading LiCoO2 (17&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 2.805&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and different formulated electrolytes. Our results suggest that the amount of LiH accumulation is negatively correlated with cyclability of practical LMBs. More importantly, we reveal a temperature sensitive equilibrium (Li + 1/2&#8201;H2 &#8652; LiH) governing formation and decomposition process of LiH at Li anode. We believe that the unusual understanding provided by this study will draw forth more insightful efforts to realize efficient Li protection and the ultimate applications of &#8220;holy grail&#8221; LMBs.

         <title>A Large Starphene Comprising Pentacene Branches</title>

Starphenes show promising optoelectronic properties. Notably, HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap presumably decreases with their increasing size, making larger homologues extremely desirable. Unfortunately, with the size, their instability and insolubility also increase, challenging classical synthetic ways. A new method has been developed, enabling synthesis of large starphenes in a quantity sufficient for their full characterisation and further applications.







Abstract
Starphenes are attractive compounds due to their characteristic physicochemical properties that are inherited from acenes, making them interesting compounds for organic electronics and optics. However, the instability and low solubility of larger starphene homologs make their synthesis extremely challenging. Herein, we present a new strategy leading to pristine [16]starphene in preparative scale. Our approach is based on a synthesis of a carbonyl&#8208;protected starphene precursor that is thermally converted in a solid&#8208;state form to the neat [16]starphene, which is then characterised with a variety of analytical methods, such as 13C CP&#8208;MAS NMR, TGA, MS MALDI, UV/Vis and FTIR spectroscopy. Furthermore, high&#8208;resolution STM experiments unambiguously confirm its expected structure and reveal a moderate electronic delocalisation between the pentacene arms. Nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shifts NICS(1) are also calculated to survey its aromatic character.

         <title>Tweaking a BODIPY Spherical Self&#8208;Assembly to 2D Supramolecular Polymers Facilitates Excited&#8208;State Cascade Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7851-7859, March 29, 2021. </description>

A designed Y&#8208;shaped BODIPY exhibits a solvent&#8208;dependent morphology transition with distinct excited&#8208;state behavior. In methylcyclohexane, spherical assemblies are formed with normal emission in the visible region, whereas in n&#8208;decane, 2D supramolecular sheets with multiple emission in the visible to NIR region are formed.







Abstract
Excited state properties such as emission, exciton transport, electron transfer, etc., are strongly dependent on the shape, size and molecular arrangement of chromophore based supramolecular architectures. Herein, we demonstrate creation and control of distinct supramolecular energy landscapes for the reversible control of the excited&#8208;state emission processes through cascade energy transfer in chromophore assemblies, facilitated by an unprecedented solvent effect. In methylcyclohexane, a tailor&#8208;made Y&#8208;shaped BODIPY derivative self&#8208;assembles to form an unusual spherical architecture of 400&#8211;1200&#8197;nm size, which exhibits a single emission at 540&#8197;nm upon 475&#8197;nm excitation through a normal excitation deactivation process. However, in n&#8208;decane, the same BODIPY derivative forms two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular sheets, exhibiting multiple emission peaks at 540, 610, 650, 725 and 790&#8197;nm with 475&#8197;nm excitation due to cascade energy transfer. Further control on the morphology and excitation energy transfer is possible with variable solvent composition and ultrasound stimulation, resulting in enhanced near&#8208;infrared emission with an overall pseudo Stokes shift of 7105&#8197;cm&#8722;1.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excited state properties such as emission, exciton transport, electron transfer, etc., are strongly dependent on the shape, size and molecular arrangement of chromophore based supramolecular architectures. Herein, we demonstrate creation and control of distinct supramolecular energy landscapes for the reversible control of the excited&#8208;state emission processes through cascade energy transfer in chromophore assemblies, facilitated by an unprecedented solvent effect. In methylcyclohexane, a tailor&#8208;made Y&#8208;shaped BODIPY derivative self&#8208;assembles to form an unusual spherical architecture of 400&#8211;1200&#8197;nm size, which exhibits a single emission at 540&#8197;nm upon 475&#8197;nm excitation through a normal excitation deactivation process. However, in &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;decane, the same BODIPY derivative forms two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular sheets, exhibiting multiple emission peaks at 540, 610, 650, 725 and 790&#8197;nm with 475&#8197;nm excitation due to cascade energy transfer. Further control on the morphology and excitation energy transfer is possible with variable solvent composition and ultrasound stimulation, resulting in enhanced near&#8208;infrared emission with an overall pseudo Stokes shift of 7105&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Exclusively Relativistic: Periodic Trends in the Melting and Boiling Points of Group&#8197;12</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7703-7709, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only very recently has it become possible to obtain accurate melting and boiling points from quantum&#8208;chemical simulations. These show that the periodic trends observed for the Group&#8197;12 elements are exclusively relativistic in nature, which can be rationalized in terms of the relativistic change in the corresponding cohesive energies.







Abstract
First&#8208;principles simulations can advance our understanding of phase transitions but are often too costly for the heavier elements, which require a relativistic treatment. Addressing this challenge, we recently composed an indirect approach: A precise incremental calculation of absolute Gibbs energies for the solid and liquid with a relativistic Hamiltonian that enables an accurate determination of melting and boiling points (MPs and BPs). Here, we apply this approach to the Group&#8197;12 elements Zn, Cd, Hg, and Cn, whose MPs and BPs we calculate with a mean absolute deviation of only 5&#8201;% and 1&#8201;%, respectively, while we confirm the previously predicted liquid aggregate state of Cn. At a non&#8208;relativistic level of theory, we obtain surprisingly similar MPs and BPs of 650&#177;30&#8197;K and 1250&#177;20&#8197;K, suggesting that periodic trends in this group are exclusively relativistic in nature. Ultimately, we discuss these results and their implication for Groups&#8197;11 and&#8197;14.

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidation of Functionalized Aldimines as 1,4&#8208;Dipoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7913-7919, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiodivergent organocatalysis has been successfully developed via a 1,4&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of functionalized aldimines with trifluoromethyl ketones catalyzed by carbene catalysts with the same absolute configuration, leading to both (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208; enantiomers of six&#8208;membered heterocycles. These new 1,4&#8208;dipoles can also react with isatin and its imines under carbene catalysis, allowing for access to the spiro oxindoles with excellent enantiomeric ratios.







Abstract
The use of functionalized aldimines has been demonstrated as newly structural 1,4&#8208;dipole precursors under carbene catalysis. More importantly, enantiodivergent organocatalysis has been successfully developed using carbene catalysts with the same absolute configuration, leading to both (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208; enantiomers of six&#8208;membered heterocycles with quaternary carbon centers. This strategy features a broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions, and good enantiomeric ratio. DFT calculation results indicated that hydrogen bond C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interactions between the catalyst and substrate are the key factors for controlling and even switching the enantioselectivity. These new 1,4&#8208;dipoles can also react with isatin and its imines under carbene catalysis, allowing for access to the spiro oxindoles with excellent enantiomeric ratios.

         <title>Cu(OTf)2&#8208;Mediated Cross&#8208;Coupling of Nitriles and N&#8208;Heterocycles with Arylboronic Acids to Generate Nitrilium and Pyridinium Products**

Cu(OTf)2 promotes the oxidative arylation of nitriles and N&#8208;heterocycles to generate ionic products. Mechanistic studies suggest the process operates via reductive elimination from a CuIII complex bearing neutral N&#8208;ligands to generate nitrilium and pyridinium products. The reaction is general for a range of N(sp) and N(sp2) precursors and can be applied to drug synthesis and late&#8208;stage N&#8208;arylation.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling generally forms C&#8722;N bonds by reductive elimination from metal complexes bearing covalent C&#8208; and N&#8208;ligands. We have identified a Cu&#8208;mediated C&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling that uses a dative N&#8208;ligand in the bond&#8208;forming event, which, in contrast to conventional methods, generates reactive cationic products. Mechanistic studies suggest the process operates via transmetalation of an aryl organoboron to a CuII complex bearing neutral N&#8208;ligands, such as nitriles or N&#8208;heterocycles. Subsequent generation of a putative CuIII complex enables the oxidative C&#8211;N coupling to take place, delivering nitrilium intermediates and pyridinium products. The reaction is general for a range of N(sp) and N(sp2) precursors and can be applied to drug synthesis and late&#8208;stage N&#8208;arylation, and the limitations in the methodology are mechanistically evidenced.

A diene&#8208;platinum complex, (COD)Pt(TFA)2, serves as an efficient and chemoselective catalyst for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;desaturation of cyclic ketones through direct Pt&#8208;enolate formation. Distinct from known ketone dehydrogenation methods, a wide range of sensitive functional groups are tolerated. Mechanistic studies suggest a fast reversible &#945;&#8208;deprotonation followed by rate&#8208;determining &#946;&#8208;H elimination.







Abstract
The development of a platinum&#8208;catalyzed desaturation of cyclic ketones to their conjugated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated counterparts is reported in this full article. A unique diene&#8208;platinum complex was identified to be an efficient catalyst, which enables direct metal&#8208;enolate formation. The reaction operates under mild conditions without using strong bases or acids. Good to excellent yields can be achieved for diverse and complex scaffolds. A wide range of functional groups, including those sensitive to acids, bases/nucleophiles, or palladium species, are tolerated, which represents a distinct feature from other known desaturation methods. Mechanistically, this platinum catalysis exhibits a fast and reversible &#945;&#8208;deprotonation followed by a rate&#8208;determining &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination process, which is different from the prior Pd&#8208;catalyzed desaturation method. Promising preliminary enantioselective desaturation using a chiral&#8208;diene&#8208;platinum complex has also been obtained.

A new series of discrete oligomeric linearly fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) stabilized by peri&#8208;annulation in described. The intrinsic perylene units of the novel PAHs with up to 13(!) linearly fused rings are responsible for colorful and bright photophysical properties.







Abstract
The longer acenes with more than six linearly fused six&#8208;membered rings are still fascinating chemists and physicists because of their unique photophysical properties and their high potential for organic electronics applications. Unfortunately, with increasing size (seven and more rings) these compounds rapidly lose chemical stability. Besides kinetic and chemical stabilization approaches introducing either bulky or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups or both, such systems also have been stabilized by peri&#8208;annulation. Although strictly spoken, these peri&#8208;annulated compounds are no longer real acenes, they have fascinating properties as well. Herein, we describe the first synthesis of a new series of peri&#8208;annulated acenes with up to 13 linearly fused rings, which is unprecedented till date. Furthermore, this new series contains perylene units connected through benzene rings along their [b,k]edges, responsible for unique absorption and emission properties.

         <title>A Fast Room&#8208;Temperature Self&#8208;Healing Glassy Polyurethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7947-7955, March 29, 2021. </description>

A glassy polyurethane (GPU) assembled by linear oligomers carrying abundant weak hydrogen bonds is presented. It is not only colorless, transparent, and stiff, but also shows fast room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing owing to the high mobility of the loosely packed hydrogen bonds in the glassy state. Molecular&#8208;level events that occur in this process are established.







Abstract
We designed and synthesized a colorless transparent glassy polyurethane assembled using low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight oligomers carrying a large number of loosely packed weak hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds), which has a glass transition temperature (Tg) up to 36.8&#8201;&#176;C and behaves unprecedentedly robust stiffness with a tensile Young's modulus of 1.56&#177;0.03&#8197;GPa. Fast room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing was observed in this polymer network: the broken glassy polyurethane (GPU) specimen can recover to a tensile strength up 7.74&#177;0.76&#8197;MPa after healing for as little as 10&#8197;min, which is prominent compared to reported room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing polymers. The high density of loose&#8208;packed hydrogen bonds can reversibly dissociate/associate below Tg of GPU (that is secondary relaxation), which enables the reconfiguration of the damaged network in the fractured interfaces, despite the extremely slow diffusion dynamics of molecular chains under room temperature. This GPU shows potential application as an optical lens.

         <title>Controllable Self&#8208;Assembly of Peptide&#8208;Cyanine Conjugates In Vivo as Fine&#8208;Tunable Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7809-7819, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of peptide&#8208;cyanine conjugates that intracellularly self&#8208;assemble into a one&#8208;dimensional column with controlled cyanine aggregation exhibit distinct imaging or photothermal properties. Through rational molecular design, the assembly behavior of cyanine dyes is precisely regulated in biological systems, resulting in two kinds of assemblies with different properties. The relationship between structure and function has been studied in detail.







Abstract
The fabrication of functional assemblies with defined structures through controllable molecular packing under physiological conditions is challenging. Here, modularly designed peptide&#8208;cyanine conjugates that intracellularly self&#8208;assembly into 1D columnar superstructures with controlled cyanine aggregation were designed, and they exhibit distinct imaging or photothermal properties. The peptide backbone is cleaved by caspase&#8208;3/7 after entering the cells. Then the self&#8208;assembled residue, with a double cyanine substitution (Pr&#8208;2Cy), forms a P helical column in which H&#8208;aggregated cyanine dyes show 3.4&#8208;fold photothermal conversion efficiency compared to free ones. The self&#8208;assembled residue with a single cyanine substitution (Pr&#8208;1Cy) forms a loose column, in which cyanine dyes with undefined structure have a fluorescence quantum yield of up to 9.5&#8201;% (emission at 819&#8197;nm in H2O). This work provides a simple way to modify in vivo self&#8208;assembled peptides with functional molecules for achieving desired bio&#8208;applications.

         <title>Observation of Carbonic Acid Formation from Interaction between Carbon Dioxide and Ice by Using In Situ Modulation Excitation IR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7860-7865, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that carbonic acid (H2CO3) can be formed from CO2 and H2O on an ice surface without neither high energy irradiation nor protonation of bicarbonate or carbonate by strong acids. This was possible by using in&#8197;situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy combined with modulation excitation spectroscopy.







Abstract
Carbonic acid, H2CO3, is of fundamental importance in nature both in living and non&#8208;living systems. Providing direct spectroscopic evidence for carbonic acid formation is however a challenge. Here we provide clear evidence by in&#8197;situ attenuated total reflection IR spectroscopy combined with modulation excitation spectroscopy and phase&#8208;sensitive detection that CO2 adsorption on ice surfaces is accompanied by carbonic acid formation. We demonstrate that carbonic acid can be formed from CO2 on ice in the absence of high&#8208;energy irradiation and without protonation by strong acids. The formation of carbonic acid is favored at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it rapidly dissociates to form bicarbonate (HCO3&#8722;) and carbonate (CO32&#8722;). The direct formation of carbonic acid from adsorption of CO2 on ice could play a role in the upper troposphere in cirrus clouds, where all the necessary ingredients to form carbonic acid, that is, low temperature, CO2 gas, and ice, are present.

         <title>Polaron Delocalization in Donor&#8211;Acceptor Polymers and its Impact on Organic Electrochemical Transistor Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7777-7785, March 29, 2021. </description>

Monomer selection in organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conduction polymers is shown to directly impact their polaron delocalization and consequently their performance in (bio)electronic devices, thus outlining molecular design guidelines for the development of next generation high&#8208;performance materials.







Abstract
Donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) polymers are promising materials for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), as they minimize detrimental faradaic side&#8208;reactions during OECT operation, yet their steady&#8208;state OECT performance still lags far behind their all&#8208;donor counterparts. We report three D&#8208;A polymers based on the diketopyrrolopyrrole unit that afford OECT performances similar to those of all&#8208;donor polymers, hence representing a significant improvement to the previously developed D&#8208;A copolymers. In addition to improved OECT performance, DFT simulations of the polymers and their respective hole polarons also reveal a positive correlation between hole polaron delocalization and steady&#8208;state OECT performance, providing new insights into the design of OECT materials. Importantly, we demonstrate how polaron delocalization can be tuned directly at the molecular level by selection of the building blocks comprising the polymers&#8217; conjugated backbone, thus paving the way for the development of even higher performing OECT polymers.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Assisted Loading and Docking Conformations of Pharmaceuticals in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

The defects in MOFs and the strong Coulombic interactions were found to be the most important factors determining the loading capacity of MOF&#8208;based drug&#8208;delivery systems (see picture). The drug&#8211;carrier interaction and loading conformations of drug molecules were revealed by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance characterization and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Understanding of drug&#8211;carrier interactions is essential for the design and application of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based drug&#8208;delivery systems, and such drug&#8211;carrier interactions can be fundamentally different for MOFs with or without defects. Herein, we reveal that the defects in MOFs play a key role in the loading of many pharmaceuticals with phosphate or phosphonate groups. The host&#8211;guest interaction is dominated by the Coulombic attraction between phosphate/phosphonate groups and defect sites, and it strongly enhances the loading capacity. For similar molecules without a phosphate/phosphonate group or for MOFs without defects, the loading capacity is greatly reduced. We employed solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and molecular simulations to elucidate the drug&#8211;carrier interaction mechanisms. Through a synergistic combination of experimental and theoretical analyses, the docking conformations of pharmaceuticals at the defects were revealed.

         <title>Kinetics of H2 Adsorption at the Metal&#8211;Support Interface of Au/TiO2 Catalysts Probed by Broad Background IR Absorbance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7735-7743, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
FTIR studies during H2 activation over Au/TiO2 present clear spectroscopic evidence of H2 activation between Au and Ti&#8208;OH groups at the metal&#8211;support interface. Electron transfer to the support shifts the broad background absorbance (BBA), enabling the differentiation of activation barriers forH2(D2) adsorption and surface (Ti&#8208;OH) H/D exchange.







Abstract
H2 adsorption on Au catalysts is weak and reversible, making it difficult to quantitatively study. We demonstrate H2 adsorption on Au/TiO2 catalysts results in electron transfer to the support, inducing shifts in the FTIR background. This broad background absorbance (BBA) signal is used to quantify H2 adsorption; adsorption equilibrium constants are comparable to volumetric adsorption measurements. H2 adsorption kinetics measured with the BBA show a lower Eapp value (23&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) for H2 adsorption than previously reported from proxy H/D exchange (33&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). We also identify a previously unreported H&#8208;O&#8208;H bending vibration associated with proton adsorption on electronically distinct Ti&#8208;OH metal&#8208;support interface sites, providing new insight into the nature and dynamics of H2 adsorption at the Au/TiO2 interface.

         <title>Liquid Phase Peptide Synthesis via One&#8208;Pot Nanostar Sieving (PEPSTAR)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7786-7795, March 29, 2021. </description>

PEPSTAR, a &#8220;rising star&#8221; in peptide synthesis, features a &#8220;nanostar&#8221; support to grow peptides with organic solvent nanofiltration for isolation. The three&#8208;armed and monodisperse nanostar enables efficient nanofiltration and real&#8208;time reaction monitoring. A cycle consists of coupling, Fmoc removal and nanofiltration, which all performed continuously in a synthesizer to produce high purity peptide crudes through a one&#8208;pot approach.







Abstract
Herein, a one&#8208;pot liquid phase peptide synthesis featuring iterative addition of amino acids to a &#8220;nanostar&#8221; support, with organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) for isolation of the growing peptide after each synthesis cycle is reported. A cycle consists of coupling, Fmoc removal, then sieving out of the reaction by&#8208;products via nanofiltration in a reactor&#8208;separator, or synthesizer apparatus where no phase or material transfers are required between cycles. The three&#8208;armed and monodisperse nanostar facilitates both efficient nanofiltration and real&#8208;time reaction monitoring of each process cycle. This enabled the synthesis of peptides more efficiently while retaining the full benefits of liquid phase synthesis. PEPSTAR was validated initially with the synthesis of enkephalin&#8208;like model penta&#8208; and decapeptides, then octreotate amide and finally octreotate. The crude purities compared favorably to vendor produced samples from solid phase synthesis.

         <title>Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Activation of Remote Nitrogen Atoms of (Benz)imidazole&#8208;Derived Aldimines for Enantioselective Synthesis of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7906-7912, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mode of carbene&#8208;catalyzed activation and reaction of nitrogen atom is disclosed. The reaction starts with the addition of the carbene catalyst to imine to form an aza&#8208;Breslow intermediate to eventually form NHC&#8208;bound triaza&#8208;diene as the key intermediate. This triaza&#8208;diene intermediate then undergoes highly enantioselective reactions with activated ketones through a concerted asynchronous pathway.







Abstract
A new mode of carbene&#8208;catalyzed heteroatom activation and asymmetric reactions is disclosed. The reaction starts with addition of a carbene catalyst to a (benz)imidazole&#8208;derived aldimine substrate. Subsequent oxidation and proton transfer lead to the formation of a catalyst&#8208;bound triaza&#8208;diene as the key intermediate, in which the nitrogen atom at a site remote to the catalyst&#8208;substrate bond is activated. This unusual triaza&#8208;diene intermediate then undergoes highly enantioselective reactions with activated ketones through a concerted asynchronous pathway, as supported by mechanistic studies and preliminary density function theory calculation.

         <title>Effect of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF) Database Selection on the Assessment of Gas Storage and Separation Potentials of MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7828-7837, March 29, 2021. </description>

We examined thousands of common materials in two widely used computation&#8208;ready metal&#8211;organic framework databases (MOF DBs) to reveal how structural discrepancies affect simulated CH4, H2, CO2 uptakes and CH4/H2 separation performances of MOFs. Identification of the top&#8208;performing materials for gas separation was shown to strongly depend on the DB used in simulations.







Abstract
Development of computation&#8208;ready metal&#8211;organic framework databases (MOF DBs) has accelerated high&#8208;throughput computational screening (HTCS) of materials to identify the best candidates for gas storage and separation. These DBs were constructed using structural curations to make MOFs directly usable for molecular simulations, which caused the same MOF to be reported with different structural features in different DBs. We examined thousands of common materials of the two recently updated, very widely used MOF DBs to reveal how structural discrepancies affect simulated CH4, H2, CO2 uptakes and CH4/H2 separation performances of MOFs. Results showed that DB selection has a significant effect on the calculated gas uptakes and ideal selectivities of materials at low pressure. A detailed analysis on the curated structures was provided to isolate the critical elements of MOFs determining the gas uptakes. Identification of the top&#8208;performing materials for gas separation was shown to strongly depend on the DB used in simulations.

These DBs were constructed using structural curations to make MOFs directly usable for molecular simulations, which caused the same MOF to be reported with different structural features in different DBs. We examined thousands of common materials of the two recently updated, very widely used MOF DBs to reveal how structural discrepancies affect simulated CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptakes and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation performances of MOFs. Results showed that DB selection has a significant effect on the calculated gas uptakes and ideal selectivities of materials at low pressure. A detailed analysis on the curated structures was provided to isolate the critical elements of MOFs determining the gas uptakes. Identification of the top&#8208;performing materials for gas separation was shown to strongly depend on the DB used in simulations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Universal Approach for Controllable Synthesis of n&#8208;Specific Layered 2D Perovskite Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7866-7872, March 29, 2021. </description>

Single&#8208;phase 2D lead&#8208; and tin&#8208;based perovskite nanoplates with a designated n value can be successfully prepared through kinetic control of the nucleation process. This approach can effectively avoid the multipeak photoluminescence generally observed in multilayer 2D perovskite nanomaterials.







Abstract
2D perovskites with chemical formula A&#8242;2An&#8722;1BnX3n+1 have recently attracted considerable attention due to their tunable optical and electronic properties, which can be attained by varying the chemical composition. While high color&#8208;purity emitting perovskite nanomaterials have been accomplished through changing the halide composition, the preparation of single&#8208;phase, specific n&#8208;layer 2D perovskite nanomaterials is still pending because of the fast nucleation process of nanoparticles. We demonstrate a facile, rational and efficacious approach to synthesizing single&#8208;phase 2D perovskite nanoplates with a designated n number for both lead&#8208; and tin&#8208;based perovskites through kinetic control. Casting carboxylic acid additives in the reaction medium promotes selective formation of the kinetic product&#8212;multilayer 2D perovskite&#8212;in preference to the single&#8208;layer thermodynamic product. For the n&#8208;specific layered 2D perovskites, decreasing the number of octahedral layers per inorganic sheet leads to an increase of photoluminescence energy, radiative decay rate, and a significant boost in photostability.

         <title>The Reduced Nitridogermanates(III) Ca6[Ge2N6] and Sr6[Ge2N6] with Ge&#8722;Ge Bonds</title>

The nitridogermanates(III), Ca6[Ge2N6] and Sr6[Ge2N6], contain the hitherto unknown molecular anion [Ge2N6]12&#8722; featuring a Ge&#8722;Ge&#8208;bond and thus represent the first members of a novel class of compounds virtually unknown in the nitride chemistry of tetrel elements.







Abstract
The first nitridogermanates(III) Ca6[Ge2N6] and Sr6[Ge2N6] were synthesized from sodium flux and structurally characterized by powder and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, respectively. They crystallize isostructurally to each other and homeotypic to Ca6[Cr2N6]H in space group R
. They feature unprecedented, mutually isolated, ethane&#8208;like [GeIII2N6]12&#8722; anions in a staggered conformation. The compounds are semiconductors according to resistivity measurements and electronic structure calculations, yielding band gaps of 1.1&#8197;eV for Ca6[Ge2N6] and 0.2&#8197;eV for Sr6[Ge2N6].

         <title>Handedness Inversion of Chiral 3&#8208;Aminophenol Formaldehyde Resin Nanotubes Mediated by Metal Coordination</title>

A metal ion&#8208;mediated supramolecular co&#8208;templating method was employed for the first time to fabricate chiral 3&#8208;aminophenol formaldehyde resin nanotubes with controllable helical sense and optical activity with an enantiomerically pure template system.







Abstract
Precise adjustment of microstructure and handedness of chiral nanomaterials is important to regulate their properties and performance. Herein, helical 3&#8208;aminophenol formaldehyde resin (APF) nanotubes and corresponding carbonaceous nanotubes with controllable handedness and optical activity were obtained via an external metal ion&#8208;mediated supramolecular co&#8208;templating method in an enantiomerically pure template system, in which an appropriate amount of Mn2+ (Co2+ or Ni2+) with moderate coordination abilities can reverse the spatial arrangement of the phenylglycine&#8208;based amphiphilic template molecules through metal coordination. Different stacking modes of coordination complexes in disparate metal ion systems lead to diverse helical senses (diameter and pitch) of the obtained helical APF. In addition, this coordination mode of metal intervention can be applied to other amine&#8208;based helical polymer synthesis systems, which paves the way for the design of high&#8208;quality chiral nanomaterials with satisfactory physical parameters and properties.

         <title>Generation of Elemental Fluorine through the Electrolysis of Copper Difluoride at Room Temperature</title>

         <dc:description>
The generation of fluorine gas is achieved at room temperature through the electrolysis of CuF2 in a CsF&#8208;2.45HF molten salt without the evolution of H2 gas. Stable electrolysis with a Ni anode over 100&#8197;h (F2 purity over 99&#8201;%), with the potential to operate under one&#8208;compartment electrolysis, led to a safe and propitious method for the generation of high&#8208;purity fluorine gas for small&#8208;scale lab and industrial applications.







Abstract
The safe generation of F2 gas at room temperature by using simple cell configurations has been the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; of fluorine research for centuries. Thus, to address this issue, we report generation of F2 gas through the electrolysis of CuF2 in a CsF&#8208;2.45HF molten salt without the evolution of H2 gas. The CuF2 is selected through a series of thermodynamic and kinetic assessments of possible metal fluorides. Anode assessments on graphite and glass&#8208;like carbon demonstrate the effect of the absence of the anode during generation of F2 gas owing to stabilized operations at room temperature. Although the Ni anode dissolves during electrolysis in the conventional medium&#8208;temperature cell, herein, it facilitates stable electrolysis over 100&#8197;h, achieving an F2 gas purity of over 99&#8201;% with the potential to operate using one&#8208;compartment electrolysis. This work presents a safe and propitious method for the generation of high&#8208;purity F2 gas for small&#8208;scale lab and industrial applications.

         <title>Synergetic Lipid Extraction with Oxidative Damage Amplifies Cell&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Destructive Stresses and Enables Rapid Sterilization</title>

A rapid sterilization approach using MoS2 nanosheets is reported. The MoS2 nanosheets enabled the extraction of lipids from cell membranes causing subsequent membrane disruptions. Additionally, the nanosheets activated permonosulfate molecules to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that both refreshed the MoS2 surface and attacked the cell membrane, thereby amplifying the cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;destructive stresses toward pathogenic microorganisms.







Abstract
Here, we introduce an innovative &#8220;poison arrowhead&#8221; approach for disinfection based on a nanosheet bacterial inactivation system that acts synergistically to achieve sterilization rates of &gt;99.99&#8201;% (Escherichia coli) over an ultrashort time period (&#8776;0.5&#8197;min). The two&#8208;dimensional MoS2 &#8220;arrowhead&#8221; configuration has a sharp edge structure that enables the vigorous extraction of lipids from cell membranes and subsequent membrane disruptions. In the presence of permonosulfate, a strong oxidant, sulfur vacancies containing MoS2 activate the stable molecules, which in turn produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) from edge sites to basal areas. This process not only scavenges some portion of the phospholipids to allow for MoS2 surface refreshment but also directly attacks proteins thereby inflicting further damage to injured cells and amplifying the cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;destructive stresses toward pathogenic microorganisms. With small amounts of the new material, we successfully disinfected natural water (&#8776;99.93&#8201;% inactivation in terms of total bacteria) within 30&#8197;s.

Poly(alkyl&#8208;terphenyl piperidinium) membranes and ionomers display outstanding hydrogen&#8208;barrier properties and mechanical properties as well as excellent hydroxide&#8208;ion conductivity that results in an excellent power density of 2.58&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1.38&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 80&#8201;&#176;C in H2/O2 and H2/air, respectively, along with a new, outstanding specific power in alkaline&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells.







Abstract
Aryl&#8208;ether&#8208;free anion&#8208;exchange ionomers (AEIs) and membranes (AEMs) have become an important benchmark to address the insufficient durability and power&#8208;density issues associated with AEM fuel cells (AEMFCs). Here, we present aliphatic chain&#8208;containing poly(diphenyl&#8208;terphenyl piperidinium) (PDTP) copolymers to reduce the phenyl content and adsorption of AEIs and to increase the mechanical properties of AEMs. Specifically, PDTP AEMs possess excellent mechanical properties (storage modulus&gt;1800&#8197;MPa, tensile strength&gt;70&#8197;MPa), H2 fuel&#8208;barrier properties (&lt;10&#8197;Barrer), good ion conductivity, and ex&#8208;situ stability. Meanwhile, PDTP AEIs with low phenyl content and high&#8208;water permeability display excellent peak power densities (PPDs). The present AEMFCs reach outstanding PPDs of 2.58&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&gt;7.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density) and 1.38&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 80&#8201;&#176;C in H2/O2 and H2/air, respectively, along with a specific power (PPD/catalyst loading) over 8&#8197;W&#8201;mg&#8722;1, which is the highest record for Pt&#8208;based AEMFCs so far.

         <title>A General Approach for Monolayer Adsorption of High Weight Loadings of Uniform Nanocrystals on Oxide Supports</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7971-7979, March 29, 2021. </description>

A general strategy for monolayer adsorption of hydrophobic surfactant&#8208;stabilized nanocrystals on oxides through surface functionalization with amino groups is presented.







Abstract
Monodispersed metal and semiconductor nanocrystals have attracted great attention in fundamental and applied research due to their tunable size, morphology, and well&#8208;defined chemical composition. Utilizing these nanocrystals in a controllable way is highly desirable especially when using them as building blocks for the preparation of nanostructured materials. Their deposition onto oxide materials provide them with wide applicability in many areas, including catalysis. However, so far deposition methods are limited and do not provide control to achieve high particle loadings. This study demonstrates a general approach for the deposition of hydrophobic ligand&#8208;stabilized nanocrystals on hydrophilic oxide supports without ligand&#8208;exchange. Surface functionalization of the supports with primary amine groups either using an organosilane ((3&#8208;aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane) or bonding with aminoalcohols (3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2&#8208;propanediol) were found to significantly improve the interaction between nanocrystals and supports achieving high loadings (&gt;10&#8197;wt.&#8201;%). The bonding method with aminoalcohols guarantees the opportunity to remove the binding molecules thus allowing clean metal/oxide materials to be obtained, which is of great importance in the preparation of supported nanocrystals for heterogeneous catalysis.

The internal structure of single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) has been investigated, forming nanosized domains preformed during the crosslinking process. We present proof for the presence of nano&#8208;compartments within SCNPs via a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and fluorescence spectroscopy. A novel strategy to encapsulate labels within such water dispersible SCNPs is presented.







Abstract
Single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) are highly versatile structures resembling proteins, able to function as catalysts or biomedical delivery systems. Based on their synthesis by single&#8208;chain collapse into nanoparticular systems, their internal structure is complex, resulting in nanosized domains preformed during the crosslinking process. In this study we present proof of such nanocompartments within SCNPs via a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and fluorescence spectroscopy. A novel strategy to encapsulate labels within these water dispersible SCNPs with hydrodynamic radii of &#8776;5&#8197;nm is presented, based on amphiphilic polymers with additional covalently bound labels, attached via the copper catalyzed azide/alkyne &#8220;click&#8221; reaction (CuAAC). A detailed profile of the interior of the SCNPs and the labels&#8217; microenvironment was obtained via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, followed by an assessment of their photophysical properties.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Loaded Nanoreactors Enable the Continuous Regeneration of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide in Artificial Metabolisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7728-7734, March 29, 2021. </description>

The right combination: An artificial enzyme combination is presented that continuously produces NAD+ from oxygen and water and a catalytic amount of pyruvate, without additional substrates and without generating byproducts. Three enzymes are covalently encapsulated into a substrate&#8208;permeable silica nanoreactor by a mild fluoride&#8208;catalyzed sol&#8211;gel process. NAD+ from the nanoreactors was successfully used for the continuous production of NAD+ for sensing glucose and for rapidly reducing the non&#8208;oxygen binding methemoglobin to oxygen&#8208;binding hemoglobin.







Abstract
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential coenzyme for numerous biocatalytic pathways. While in nature, NAD+ is continuously regenerated from NADH by enzymes, all synthetic NAD+ regeneration strategies require a continuous supply of expensive reagents and generate byproducts, making these strategies unattractive. In contrast, we present an artificial enzyme combination that produces NAD+ from oxygen and water continuously; no additional organic substrates are required once a minimal amount pyruvate is supplied. Three enzymes, i.e., LDH, LOX, and CAT, are covalently encapsulated into a substrate&#8208;permeable silica nanoreactor by a mild fluoride&#8208;catalyzed sol&#8211;gel process. The enzymes retain their activity inside of the nanoreactors and are protected against proteolysis and heat. We successfully used NAD+ from the nanoreactors for the continuous production of NAD+ i)&#8197;to sense glucose in artificial glucose metabolism, and ii)&#8197;to reduce the non&#8208;oxygen binding methemoglobin to oxygen&#8208;binding hemoglobin. This latter conversion might be used for the treatment of Methemoglobinemia. We believe that this versatile tool will allow the design of artificial NAD+&#8208;dependent metabolisms or NAD+&#8208;mediated redox&#8208;reactions.

An atom&#8208;economical method for the direct B&#8722;H functionalization of nido&#8208;carboranes (7,8&#8208;nido&#8208;C2B9H12&#8722;) has been developed under electrochemical reaction conditions. In this reaction system, anodic oxidation serves as a green alternative for traditional chemical oxidants in the oxidation of nido&#8208;carboranes. Coupling nido&#8208;carboranes with thioethers, selenides, tellurides, N&#8208;heterocycles, phosphates, phosphines, arsenides and antimonides demonstrates high site&#8208;selectivity and efficiency.

         <title>Double &#960;&#8208;Extended Undecabenzo[7]helicene</title>

More than double: This paper presents the first double &#960;&#8208;extended undecabenzo[7]helicene. It is a chiral nanographene, displaying an extremely strong light absorption capability with a record high ECD intensity in the visible spectral range known for any discrete PAH compound.







Abstract
This work reports the first double &#960;&#8208;extended undecabenzo[7]helicene 1, which is a large chiral nanographene, composed of 65 fused rings and 186 conjugated carbon atoms. The molecular identity of 1 has been confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. A wine coloured solution of 1 in dichloromethane absorbs light from ultraviolet to the near infrared, featuring an extremely large molar absorption coefficient of 844&#8201;000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 573&#8197;nm. Optically pure 1 shows a record high electronic circular dichroism intensity in the visible spectral range (|&#916;&#1013;|=1375&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 430&#8197;nm) known for any discrete polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. These unusual photophysical properties of 1 contrast sharply with those of a mono&#8208;undecabenzo[7]helicene derivative 2.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Sulfimidation Mediated by Hydrogen Bonding Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7920-7926, March 29, 2021. </description>

A picky ligand: A chiral phenanthroline ligand allows for the site&#8208; and enantioselective imidation (Ns=para&#8208;nitrosulfonyl) of a variety of sulfides. Silver acts in concert with an achiral 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (1,10&#8208;phen) ligand as the catalytically active center.







Abstract
An enantioselective sulfimidation of 3&#8208;thiosubstituted 2&#8208;quinolones and 2&#8208;pyridones was achieved with a stoichiometric nitrene source (PhI=NNs) and a silver&#8208;based catalyst system. Key to the success of the reaction is the use of a chiral phenanthroline ligand with a hydrogen bonding site. The enantioselectivity does not depend on the size of the two substituents at the sulfur atom but only on the binding properties of the heterocyclic lactams. A total of 21 chiral sulfimides were obtained in high yields (44&#8211;99&#8201;%) and with significant enantiomeric excess (70&#8211;99&#8201;% ee). The sulfimidation proceeds with high site&#8208;selectivity and can also be employed for the kinetic resolution of chiral sulfoxides. Mechanistic evidence suggests the intermediacy of a heteroleptic silver complex, in which the silver atom is bound to one molecule of the chiral ligand and one molecule of an achiral 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline. Support for the suggested reaction course was obtained by ESI mass spectrometry, DFT calculations, and a Hammett analysis.

The dynamic structure of liquid water can be disrupted by the presence of non&#8208;polar organic molecules, in a process known as hydrophobic solvation. Maria Gim&#233;nez&#8208;L&#243;pez, Francisco Rivadulla et&#8197;al. demonstrate in their Communication on page&#8197;7540 that the particular orientation of hydrocarbon chains in tetraalkylammonium and phosphonium salts induces a peculiar structure of water molecules different from the bulk, changing its physicochemical properties.

Rapid lipid isomer identification In their Communication on page&#8197;7559, Julia Laskin and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that online derivatization using a photosensitized reaction with singlet oxygen pinpoints the location of C=C bonds in lipids. This versatile method can be coupled to nanospray desorption ionization (nano&#8208;DESI) for imaging of lipid isomers in biological samples.

A red star is born A new route for the preparation of large and insoluble molecular starphenes by decarbonylation of soluble precursors in the solid state is described in the Research Article on page&#8197;7752 by Andrej Jancarik, Andre Gourdon, and co&#8208;workers. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy in ultrahigh vacuum and absorption spectroscopy in frozen matrices, with both experiments run at liquid helium temperature, show that the electronic delocalization among the three pentacene branches is rather limited.

This Review critically discusses recent breakthroughs and future challenges in research on polyoxovanadate energy materials. The use of polyoxovanadates in batteries, redox&#8208;flow batteries, light&#8208;driven catalysis, and electrocatalysis is described together with an outlook on emerging themes and areas of future application.







Abstract
Molecular vanadium oxides, or polyoxovanadates (POVs), have recently emerged as a new class of molecular energy conversion/storage materials, which combine diverse, chemically tunable redox behavior and reversible multielectron storage capabilities. This Review explores current challenges, major breakthroughs, and future opportunities in the use of POVs for energy conversion and storage. The reactivity, advantages, and limitations of POVs are explored, with a focus on their use in lithium and post&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion batteries, redox&#8208;flow batteries, and light&#8208;driven energy conversion. Finally, emerging themes and new research directions are critically assessed to provide inspiration for how this promising materials class can advance research in sustainable energy technologies.

The integration and encapsulation of perovskite nanocrystals into multifunctional metal&#8211;organic frameworks results in new features and paves the way to promising applications. This Minireview summarizes the recent progress of perovskite NC@MOF composites from the perspective of synthetic chemistry, functional mechanisms, and potential applications.







Abstract
As an emerging optical material, perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties and show great potential for various optoelectronic applications. However, the inherent inferior stability against moisture, oxygen, light and heat limit their practical application. As well, the exploration and development of perovskite NCs with novel properties and functions are new challenges. To achieve these goals, the integration and encapsulation of perovskite NCs with multifunctional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to form perovskite NC@MOF composites, is a promising strategy for enhancing the stability and broadening the application scope. In this minireview, we summarize and discuss the synthesis strategies and functional mechanisms of perovskite NC@MOF composites, along with applications of light emitting diodes (LED), information security, photocatalysis, sensing, and detection. We further briefly point out the current challenges as well as the future opportunities for the emerged composite materials.

Fluorescence imaging facilitated by NIR&#8208;II emissive aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) is an emerging research field. This minireview summarizes recent efforts on developing novel NIR&#8208;II AIEgens in terms of molecular design strategies and bioapplications, and discusses current challenges and future prospects.







Abstract
Fluorescence imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window facilitated by aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) is an emerging research field. NIR&#8208;II AIEgens overcome limitations imposed by penetration depth and fluorescence efficiency, offering high&#8208;performance imaging with enhanced precision. Some reported NIR&#8208;II AIEgens demonstrate capabilities for fluorescence and photoacoustic bimodal imaging, and fluorescence imaging guided photothermal therapy, which not only improves diagnosis accuracy but provides an efficient theranostic platform to accelerate preclinical translation as well. This minireview summarizes recent efforts on exploiting NIR&#8208;II AIEgens with regard to molecular design strategies and bioapplications, and puts forward current challenges and promising prospects. This timely sketch should benefit the further exploitation of diverse and multifunctional NIR&#8208;II AIEgens for a wide array of applications.

This review provides a complete account of the on&#8208;surface spin&#8208;state switching behavior of films of spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes of molecular to multilayer thickness. SCO&#8208;based molecular and thin&#8208;film device architectures fabricated employing vacuum sublimation are also described.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) active transition metal complexes are an important class of switchable molecular materials due to their bistable spin&#8208;state switching characteristics at or around room temperature. Vacuum&#8208;sublimable SCO complexes are a subclass of SCO complexes suitable for fabricating ultraclean spin&#8208;switchable films desirable for applications, especially in molecular electronics/spintronics. Consequently, on&#8208;surface SCO of thin&#8208;films of sublimable SCO complexes have been studied employing spectroscopy and microscopy techniques, and results of fundamental and technological importance have been obtained. This Review provides complete coverage of advances made in the field of vacuum&#8208;sublimable SCO complexes: progress made in the design and synthesis of sublimable functional SCO complexes, on&#8208;surface SCO of molecular and multilayer thick films, and various molecular and thin&#8208;film device architectures based on the sublimable SCO complexes.

We developed a dual&#8208;target&#8208;specific aptamer recognition system combined with droplet digital PCR for precise quantitative analysis of exosomal PD&#8208;L1 (Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1). This method can distinguish tumor&#8208;derived from non&#8208;tumor&#8208;derived Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1, holding great potential for the analysis of exosome subtypes and offering unprecedented opportunities for the study of the biological functions of exosomes and their conversion into reliable clinical indicators.







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;derived exosomal proteins have emerged as promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, but the quantitation accuracy is hindered by large numbers of normal cell&#8208;derived exosomes. Herein, we developed a dual&#8208;target&#8208;specific aptamer recognition activated in&#8197;situ connection system on exosome membrane combined with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) (TRACER) for quantitation of tumor&#8208;derived exosomal PD&#8208;L1 (Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1). Leveraging the high binding affinity of aptamers, excellent selectivity of dual&#8208;aptamer recognition, and the high sensitivity of ddPCR, this method exhibits significant sensitivity and selectivity for tracing tumor&#8208;derived Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 in a wash&#8208;free manner. Due to the excellent sensitivity, the level of tumor&#8208;derived Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 detected by TRACER can distinguish cancer patients from healthy donors, and for the first time was identified as a more reliable tumor diagnostic marker than total Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1. The TRACER strategy holds great potential for converting exosomes into reliable clinical indicators and exploring the biological functions of exosomes.

         <title>cis&#8208;Quinacridone&#8208;Based Delayed Fluorescence Emitters: Seemingly Old but Renewed Functional Luminogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7643-7648, March 29, 2021. </description>

Linear cis&#8208;quinacridone (cis&#8208;QA), a structural isomer of the renowned linear trans&#8208;quinacridone with a variation in the substitution positions of two amino and carbonyl groups, has been in a state of low visibility and unmarked as functional materials for a century. This contribution unveils the fascinating functionality and usefulness of cis&#8208;QA derivatives as narrowband deep&#8208;blue delayed fluorescence emitters.







Abstract
Herein, we report a material design of linear cis&#8208;quinacridone (cis&#8208;QA) derivatives as delayed fluorescence luminogens. In contrast to the widely studied traditional trans&#8208;isomers, the functionality of cis&#8208;QA and its derivatives remains unexplored and unclarified. Through combined computational and experimental investigations, we revealed that cis&#8208;QA derivatives can function as fascinating narrowband deep&#8208;blue delayed fluorescence emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The best&#8208;performing deep&#8208;blue OLEDs incorporating these cis&#8208;QA luminogens achieved high external electroluminescence quantum efficiencies of up to 19.0&#8201;% and high color purity with chromaticity coordinates of (0.13, 0.14).

         <title>Nanoscale Amperometry Reveals that Only a Fraction of Vesicular Serotonin Content is Released During Exocytosis from Beta Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7593-7596, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exocytosis from beta cells monitored by amperometry is compared to the vesicle content assessed from intracellular vesicle impact cytometry to determine if partial release is dominant. Serotonin was used as an electroactive proxy for insulin as it is co&#8208;released. The fraction of release from insulin&#8208;containing granules in beta cells was found to be at most 34&#8201;%, providing a new perspective on insulin release for diabetes research.







Abstract
Recent work has shown that chemical release during the fundamental cellular process of exocytosis in model cell lines is not all&#8208;or&#8208;none. We tested this theory for vesicular release from single pancreatic beta cells. The vesicles in these cells release insulin, but also serotonin, which is detectible with amperometric methods. Traditionally, it is assumed that exocytosis in beta cells is all&#8208;or&#8208;none. Here, we use a multidisciplinary approach involving nanoscale amperometric chemical methods to explore the chemical nature of insulin exocytosis. We amperometrically quantified the number of serotonin molecules stored inside of individual nanoscale vesicles (39&#8201;317&#177;1611) in the cell cytoplasm before exocytosis and the number of serotonin molecules released from single cells (13&#8201;310&#177;1127) for each stimulated exocytosis event. Thus, beta cells release only one&#8208;third of their granule content, clearly supporting partial release in this system. We discuss these observations in the context of type&#8208;2 diabetes.

         <title>Hierarchy Control of MFI Zeolite Membrane towards Superior Butane Isomer Separation Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7659-7663, March 29, 2021. </description>

Through combining hollow&#8208;structured MFI nanoseeds and single&#8208;mode microwave heating during membrane processing, a hierarchical MFI zeolite membrane exhibiting superior n&#8208;/i&#8208;butane isomer separation performance was facilely prepared.







Abstract
Microstructural optimization (such as thickness and preferred orientation) is a major concern for performance enhancement of zeolite membranes. In this study, we demonstrated that the introduction of hierarchy easily enabled concurrent thickness reduction and orientation control of zeolite membranes. Specifically, hierarchical MFI zeolite membranes comprising higher degree of (h0h) preferentially oriented ultrathin (ca. 390&#8197;nm) selective top layers and porous intermediate layers on porous &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 substrates were fabricated. The use of hollow&#8208;structured MFI nanoseeds and the employment of single&#8208;mode microwave heating during membrane processing were found indispensable for the preparation of MFI zeolite membranes with superior butane isomer separation performance, thereby surpassing the current n&#8208;/i&#8208;butane selectivity versus n&#8208;butane permeance trade&#8208;off limits of MFI zeolite membranes prepared via solution&#8208;based synthetic protocols.

         <title>Complementary Syntheses Giving Access to a Full Suite of Differentially Substituted Phthalocyanine&#8208;Porphyrin Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7632-7636, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two pathways are proposed for the synthesis of an important class of functionalized phthalocyanine&#8208;porphyrin hybrids (TBTAPs). The materials are novel in their own right, but more importantly, the syntheses offer control and variation over structural and substituent modifications, a goal not yet achieved even within the extensively investigated chemistry of the parent phthalocyanines.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines and porphyrins are often the scaffolds of choice for use in widespread applications. Synthetic advances allow bespoke derivatives to be made, tailoring their properties. The selective synthesis of unsymmetrical systems, particularly phthalocyanines, has remained a significant unmet challenge. Porphyrin&#8208;phthalocyanine hybrids offer the potential to combine the favorable features of both parent structures, but again synthetic strategies are poorly developed. Here we demonstrate strategies that give straightforward, controlled access to differentially substituted meso&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrabenzotriazaporphyrins by reaction between an aryl&#8208;aminoisoindolene (A) initiator and a complementary phthalonitrile (B). The choice of precursors and reaction conditions allows selective preparation of 1:3 Ar&#8208;ABBB and, uniquely, 2:2 Ar&#8208;ABBA functionalized hybrids.

         <title>Dimeric Cycloparaphenylenes with a Rigid Aromatic Linker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7649-7653, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three cycloparaphenylene (CPP) dimers with rigid aromatic linker were synthesized from an efficient cyclocondensation reaction. The structures of those giant molecules are in rapid interconversion between cis and trans conformations. In solution, they emit brightly beyond 600&#8197;nm with quantum yield up to 80&#8201;%. Having two CPP rings within one molecule, the first 1:2 complex with C60 is constructed.







Abstract
Dimeric cycloparaphenylene (CPP) architectures with well&#8208;defined flipping motion are constructed taking advantage of an efficient cyclocondensation reaction. Variable&#8208;temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (VT&#8208;NMR) analyses and theoretical calculations indicate rapid interconversion of cis and trans conformers at room temperature, while energetically favorable trans conformer exists at low temperature with the metastable cis conformer hidden. The trihexylsilylethynyl&#8208;substituted dimer exhibits bright emission in solution at 616&#8197;nm with quantum yield up to 80&#8201;%, representing the brightest CPP&#8208;based emitter beyond 600&#8197;nm. A 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex of the dimer and C60 is established with negative cooperativity, demonstrating the first example of 1:2 complex from CPP derivatives.

         <title>Electrochemical Splitting of Methane in Molten Salts To Produce Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7664-7668, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical splitting of methane in molten salts at 500&#8201;&#176;C has been demonstrated as an energy&#8208;saving, coke&#8208;free, CO2&#8208;free, and water&#8208;free preparation of H2.







Abstract
Industrial hydrogen production based on methane steam reforming (MSR) remains challenges in intensive carbon emissions, retarded hydrogen generation owing to coke deposition over catalysts and huge consumption of water. We herein report an electrochemical splitting of methane (ESM) in molten salts at 500&#8201;&#176;C to produce hydrogen in an energy saving, emission&#8208;free and water&#8208;free manner. Following the most energy&#8208;saving route on methane&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion, methane is electrochemically oxidized at anode to generate carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The generated anodic carbon dioxide is in situ captured by the melts and reduced to solid carbon at cathode, enabling a spatial separation of anodic hydrogen generation from cathodic carbon deposition. Life&#8208;cycle assessment on hydrogen&#8208;generation technologies shows that the ESM experiences an equivalent carbon emission much lower than MSR, and a lower equivalent energy input than alkaline water electrolysis.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controllable Catalysis and Chiral Monosaccharide Recognition Induced by Cyclodextrin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7654-7658, March 29, 2021. </description>

Supramolecular assemblies composed of polycationic &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin and gold nanoparticles realize photo&#8208;controlled catalytic processes via host&#8211;guest interactions between &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin and azobenzene&#8208;modified diphenylalanine. The polycationic &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin cavity is able to recognize chiral monosaccharides, thereby achieving unprecedented selective oxidative catalytic performance.







Abstract
A supramolecular catalytic system was constructed from polycationic &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (6&#8208;Iz&#8208;&#945;&#8208;CD) and gold nanoparticles (AuNP) using a supramolecular assembly strategy. The cavity of cyclodextrin is the channel by which the substrate molecules come into contact with the catalytic center. Introduction of the azobenzene&#8208;modified diphenylalanine (Azo&#8208;FF) guest molecule allowed for precise photo&#8208;control of the catalytic activity owing to its sensitive response to irradiation. Importantly, as a unique glucose oxidase the AuNP@6&#8208;Iz&#8208;&#945;&#8208;CD realizes unprecedented chiral recognition catalysis for chiral monosaccharides. In combination with a 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) color reaction, AuNP@6&#8208;Iz&#8208;&#945;&#8208;CD is able to recognize the chirality of various monosaccharides.

         <title>Minimization of Back&#8208;Electron Transfer Enables the Elusive sp3 C&#8722;H Functionalization of Secondary Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7669-7674, March 29, 2021. </description>

Divergent radical sp3 C&#8722;H functionalization of N&#8208;alkyl anilines has been achieved using a photoredox strategy. This approach enables to overcome back&#8208;electron transfer and therefore allows direct access to previously elusive &#945;&#8208;anilinoalkyl radicals.







Abstract
Anilines are some of the most used class of substrates for application in photoinduced electron transfer. N,N&#8208;Dialkyl&#8208;derivatives enable radical generation &#945; to the N&#8208;atom by oxidation followed by deprotonation. This approach is however elusive to monosubstituted anilines owing to fast back&#8208;electron transfer (BET). Here we demonstrate that BET can be minimised by using photoredox catalysis in the presence of an exogenous alkylamine. This approach synergistically aids aniline SET oxidation and then accelerates the following deprotonation. In this way, the generation of &#945;&#8208;anilinoalkyl radicals is now possible and these species can be used in a general sense to achieve divergent sp3 C&#8722;H functionalization.

         <title>A Palette of Minimally Tagged Sucrose Analogues for Real&#8208;Time Raman Imaging of Intracellular Plant Metabolism</title>

We describe a chemical strategy to prepare sucrose derivatives with vibrational tags and the characterisation of the first optical analogue of sucrose able to image real&#8208;time trafficking of sucrose in live plant cells.







Abstract
Sucrose is the main saccharide used for long&#8208;distance transport in plants and plays an essential role in energy metabolism; however, there are no analogues for real&#8208;time imaging in live cells. We have optimised a synthetic approach to prepare sucrose analogues including very small (&#8776;50&#8197;Da or less) Raman tags in the fructose moiety. Spectroscopic analysis identified the alkyne&#8208;tagged compound 6 as a sucrose analogue recognised by endogenous transporters in live cells and with higher Raman intensity than other sucrose derivatives. Herein, we demonstrate the application of compound 6 as the first optical probe to visualise real&#8208;time uptake and intracellular localisation of sucrose in live plant cells using Raman microscopy.

         <title>Electrochemically Triggered Chain Reactions for the Conversion of Furan Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7534-7539, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method is developed to enable electrochemically triggered chain reactions for the conversion of biomass derivatives to fuel additives. Only 2&#8201;% equivalent charges are consumed, yielding an apparent Faradaic efficiency of 4700&#8201;% in terms of hydrocarbon products, whereas the only byproduct is H2 at the cathode. The reaction shows no sensitivity to oxygen from ambient air; trace amounts of water facilitate the reaction by stabilizing a key intermediate.







Abstract
We report an electrochemical method for coupling biomass&#8208;derived C5/C6 compounds to value&#8208;added fuel precursors. Using only 2&#8201;% of equivalent charges, 2&#8208;methylfuran (2&#8208;MF) was oxidized to yield a cation radical, which readily reacted with 3&#8208;hexene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione, a derivate of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran, to produce 3&#8208;(5&#8208;methylfuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)hexane&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione. The product was converted to 4&#8208;ethylnonane (a component of biodiesel/jet fuel) in a single step in excellent yield. Importantly, the reaction was not sensitive to oxygen, and a trace amount of water was found to promote the reaction. Detailed mechanistic studies confirmed the proposed reaction pathways. Key to the mechanism is the radical generation that is enabled by electrochemistry. The radical is regenerated at the end of a reaction cycle to ensure chain propagation for an average of ca. 47 times, resulting in an apparent Faradaic efficiency of 4700&#8201;%.

         <title>Robust Packing of a Self&#8208;Assembling Iridium Complex via Endocytic Trafficking for Long&#8208;Term Lysosome Tracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7597-7601, March 29, 2021. </description>

An aromatic&#8208;peptide&#8208;conjugated cyclometalated iridium(III) complex has been synthesized that emits light via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking oriented self&#8208;assembly at extremely low concentration. Through endocytic trafficking, self&#8208;assemblies are transformed from nanoparticles into sturdy packed networks that are stabilized in lysosomal acidic environment as super stable lysosomal probes, enabling super long&#8208;term live cell imaging.







Abstract
Live cell imaging of lysosome positioning and motility is critical to studying lysosome status and function for pharmacological interventions. To create a super stable lysosomal probe for long&#8208;term live cell imaging, we have designed and synthesized an aromatic&#8208;peptide&#8208;conjugated cyclometalated iridium(III) complex that emits light via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking oriented self&#8208;assembly in water at extremely low concentration. Through endocytic trafficking, self&#8208;assemblies are transformed from nanoparticles into sturdily packed networks that are stabilized in lysosomal acidic environment. Upon short time/low dose treatment of the iridium complex at passage 0, live cell lysosomal tracking is applicable beyond the 14th passage of cells with high labelling rate and a mild decline in luminescence intensity. The illuminated lysosomes are trackable using super&#8208;resolution imaging to study their response to cellular processes.

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence Loss in Photobleaching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7686-7690, March 29, 2021. </description>

Light versus light! The impact of photobleaching on the electrochemiluminescence was investigated at the level of single cells. Specific regions of the labeled membranes were photobleached confocally and then visualized by multimodal imaging. This study demonstrates the crucial role of the photobleaching process on the electrochemiluminescence signal.







Abstract
The effects of photobleaching on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) was investigated for the first time. The plasma membrane of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was labeled with a [Ru(bpy)3]2+ derivative. Selected regions of the fixed cells were photobleached using the confocal mode with sequential stepwise illumination or cumulatively and they were imaged by both ECL and photoluminescence (PL). ECL was generated with a model sacrificial coreactant, tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine. ECL microscopy of the photobleached regions shows lower ECL emission. We demonstrate a linear correlation between the ECL decrease and the PL loss due to the photobleaching of the labels immobilized on the CHO membranes. The presented strategy provides valuable information on the fundamentals of the ECL excited state and opens new opportunities for exploring cellular membranes by combining ECL microscopy with photobleaching techniques such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) or fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) methods.

         <title>Assembly of Dynamic Supramolecular Polymers on a DNA Origami Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7612-7616, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami platforms were used to assemble synthetic supramolecular polymers, retaining their dynamic nature with control over monomer composition and loading and dynamic exchange of molecular cargo. The DNA origami&#8208;templated self&#8208;assembly allows for novel strategies for controlled multicomponent self&#8208;assembly and characterization of synthetic supramolecular systems.







Abstract
Biological processes rely on transient interactions that govern assembly of biomolecules into higher order, multi&#8208;component systems. A synthetic platform for the dynamic assembly of multicomponent complexes would provide novel entries to study and modulate the assembly of artificial systems into higher order topologies. Here, we establish a hybrid DNA origami&#8208;based approach as an assembly platform that enables dynamic templating of supramolecular architectures. It entails the site&#8208;selective recruitment of supramolecular polymers to the platform with preservation of the intrinsic dynamics and reversibility of the assembly process. The composition of the supramolecular assembly on the platform can be tuned dynamically, allowing for monomer rearrangement and inclusion of molecular cargo. This work should aid the study of supramolecular structures in their native environment in real&#8208;time and incites new strategies for controlled multicomponent self&#8208;assembly of synthetic building blocks.

         <title>BiPO4&#8208;Derived 2D Nanosheets for Efficient Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Liquid Fuel</title>

The bismuth phosphate derived 2D nanosheet&#8208;like catalyst exhibits a high formate cathodic energy efficiency of 73&#8201;% at a current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The excellent catalytic performance is attributed to the 2D structure and abundant oxygen&#8208;modified Bi active sites on the surface.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to high&#8208;value liquid fuel with high selectivity is appealing for energy conversion and storage. Here we report a bismuth phosphate (BiPO4) derived 2D nanosheet&#8208;like electrocatalyst that efficiently converts CO2 into liquid&#8208;phase formate. The catalyst presents a formate Faradaic efficiency of over 90&#8201;% and a cathodic energy efficiency of 73&#8201;% at an industrially relevant current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the flow cell. The in situ generation of the Bi&#8208;O active species on the catalyst surface was determined via operando Raman measurement. Morphological and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses reveal the origin of the high activity for the electrosynthesis of formate from CO2 and water: the 2D structure together with the abundant insertion of oxygen atoms in the surface of the BiPO4&#8208;derived nanosheets.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Iron Porphyrins for Improved Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions</title>

An enzyme&#8208;inspired Fe porphyrin with a tethered imidazole is synthesized and beats its imidazole&#8208;free analogue for electrocatalytic ORR and OER. By presenting state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art molecular catalytic features, Zn&#8208;air batteries with this Fe porphyrin show equal performance to batteries with Pt/C&#8208;Ir/C. This work underlines unique benefits and promising applications of molecular electrocatalysis in new energy conversion technologies.







Abstract
Nature uses Fe porphyrin sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Synthetic Fe porphyrins have been extensively studied as ORR catalysts, but activity improvement is required. On the other hand, Fe porphyrins have been rarely shown to be efficient for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We herein report an enzyme&#8208;inspired Fe porphyrin 1 as an efficient catalyst for both ORR and OER. Complex 1, which bears a tethered imidazole for Fe binding, beats imidazole&#8208;free analogue 2, with an anodic shift of ORR half&#8208;wave potential by 160&#8197;mV and a decrease of OER overpotential by 150&#8197;mV to get the benchmark current density at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical studies suggested that hydroxide attack to a formal FeV=O form the O&#8722;O bond. The axial imidazole can prevent the formation of trans HO&#8208;FeV=O, which is less effective to form O&#8722;O bond with hydroxide. As a practical demonstration, we assembled rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery with 1, which shows equal performance to that with Pt/Ir&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Strong Self&#8208;Trapped Exciton Emissions in Two&#8208;Dimensional Na&#8208;In Halide Perovskites Triggered by Antimony Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7587-7592, March 29, 2021. </description>

Two layered double perovskites of (PEA)4NaInCl8 and (PEA)2CsNaInCl7, with the highest efficiency under ambient temperature and pressure, were successfully prepared. This study clearly presents the origin of self&#8208;trapped exciton emission and provides a feasible strategy to explore new layered perovskite emitters.







Abstract
Soft lattice and strong exciton&#8211;phonon coupling have been demonstrated in layered double perovskites (LDPs) recently; therefore, LDPs represents a promising class of compounds as excellent self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emitters for applications in solid&#8208;state lighting. However, few LDPs with outstanding STE emissions have been discovered, and their optoelectronic properties are still unclear. Based on the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Cs2NaInCl6, we synthesized two 2D derivatives (PEA)4NaInCl8:Sb (PEA=phenethylamine) and (PEA)2CsNaInCl7:Sb with monolayer and bilayer inorganic sheets by a combination of dimensional reduction and Sb&#8208;doping. Bright broadband emissions were obtained for the first time under ambient temperature and pressure, with photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 48.7&#8201;% (monolayer) and 29.3&#8201;% (bilayer), superior to current known LDPs. Spectroscopic characterizations and first&#8208;principles calculations of excited state indicate the broadband emissions originate from STEs trapped at the introduced [SbCl6]3&#8722; octahedron.

         <title>Synthesis of Core@Shell Cu&#8208;Ni@Pt&#8208;Cu Nano&#8208;Octahedra and Their Improved MOR Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7675-7680, March 29, 2021. </description>

Octahedral CuNi@Pt&#8208;Cu core@shell nanocatalysts were prepared via a seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach using CuNi octahedral cores as the template. The activity of methanol oxidation reaction is promoted by Pt&#8208;Cu {111} facets originated from such nano&#8208;architectures.







Abstract
Fabrication of 3d metal&#8208;based core@shell nanocatalysts with engineered Pt&#8208;surfaces provides an effective approach for improving the catalytic performance. The challenges in such preparation include shape control of the 3d metallic cores and thickness control of the Pt&#8208;based shells. Herein, we report a colloidal seed&#8208;mediated method to prepare octahedral CuNi@Pt&#8208;Cu core@shell nanocrystals using CuNi octahedral cores as the template. By precisely controlling the synthesis conditions including the deposition rate and diffusion rate of the shell&#8208;formation through tuning the capping ligand, reaction temperature, and heating rate, uniform Pt&#8208;based shells can be achieved with a thickness of &lt;1&#8197;nm. The resultant carbon&#8208;supported CuNi@Pt&#8208;Cu core@shell nano&#8208;octahedra showed superior activity in electrochemical methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) compared with the commercial Pt/C catalysts and carbon&#8208;supported CuNi@Pt&#8208;Cu nano&#8208;polyhedron counterparts.

         <title>Rational Fabrication of Low&#8208;Coordinate Single&#8208;Atom Ni Electrocatalysts by MOFs for Highly Selective CO2 Reduction</title>

A post&#8208;synthetic metal substitution (PSMS) strategy has been developed to construct single&#8208;atom Ni catalysts with different N coordination numbers (denoted as Ni&#8208;Nx&#8208;C) on defective carbon supports derived from metal&#8208;organic frameworks. When served as an electrocatalyst, the Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C catalyst, with lower N coordination number around Ni atoms, achieves superior catalytic performance for CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted tremendous interests due to their ultrahigh activity and selectivity. However, the rational control over coordination microenvironment of SACs remains a grand challenge. Herein, a post&#8208;synthetic metal substitution (PSMS) strategy has been developed to fabricate single&#8208;atom Ni catalysts with different N coordination numbers (denoted Ni&#8208;Nx&#8208;C) on pre&#8208;designed N&#8208;doped carbon derived from metal&#8208;organic frameworks. When served for CO2 electroreduction, the obtained Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C catalyst achieves CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 95.6&#8201;%, much superior to that of Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;C. Theoretical calculations reveal that the lower Ni coordination number in Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C can significantly enhance COOH* formation, thereby accelerating CO2 reduction. In addition, Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C shows excellent performance in Zn&#8211;CO2 battery with ultrahigh CO FE and excellent stability. This work opens up a new and general avenue to coordination microenvironment modulation (MEM) of SACs for CO2 utilization.

A unique, highly incompressible fluid formed by a tight association of water molecules around ammonium and phosphonium salts is described in this paper. Applications of this new family of supramolecular fluids in different electrochemical processes are demonstrated in this work.







Abstract
Here we show that by adjusting the concentration of tetrabutyl ammonium and phosphonium salts in water (&#8776;1.5&#8211;2.0&#8197;m), hydrophobic solvation triggers the formation of a unique, highly incompressible supramolecular liquid, with a dynamic structure similar to clathrates, involving essentially all H2O molecules of the solvent. Despite the increasing local order, the thermal diffusivity, and compressibility of these supramolecular liquids is strongly decreased with respect to bulk water due to slower relaxation dynamics. The results presented in this paper open an avenue to design a new family of supramolecular fluids, stable under atmospheric conditions, which can find important technological applications in energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Imaging and Analysis of Isomeric Unsaturated Lipids through Online Photochemical Derivatization of Carbon&#8211;Carbon Double Bonds**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7559-7563, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid derivatization of lipids using a photoinitiated reaction with singlet oxygen provides insights into the C=C bond location in the precursor lipid through diagnostic CID fragments. This method is compatible with lipidomics workflows and can be adapted for the analysis of tissue extracts and for imaging of isomeric lipids in tissue sections.







Abstract
Unraveling the complexity of the lipidome requires the development of novel approaches for the structural characterization of lipid species with isomer&#8208;level discrimination. Herein, we introduce an online photochemical approach for lipid isomer identification through selective derivatization of double bonds by reaction with singlet oxygen. Lipid hydroperoxide products are generated promptly after laser irradiation. Fragmentation of these species in a mass spectrometer produces diagnostic fragments revealing the C=C locations in the unreacted lipids. This approach uses an inexpensive light source and photosensitizer making it easy to incorporate into any lipidomics workflow. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for the shotgun profiling of C=C locations in different lipid classes present in tissue extracts using electrospray ionization (ESI) and ambient imaging of lipid species differing only by the location of C=C bonds using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano&#8208;DESI).

         <title>An Unprecedented Pillar&#8208;Cage Fluorinated Hybrid Porous Framework with Highly Efficient Acetylene Storage and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7547-7552, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;stable fluorinated hybrid porous material with ith&#8208;d topology possesses a unique pillar&#8208;cage structure, which results in a high C2H2 uptake as well as an excellent C2H2/CO2 separation performance simultaneously.







Abstract
Despite much intense investigation on the C2H2/CO2 separation, the trade&#8208;off between the adsorption capacity and separation selectivity is still tricky. To overcome the dilemma, we have rationally synthesized an ultra&#8208;stable fluorinated hybrid porous material SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA with the ith&#8208;d topology. Completely differing from the famous pillar&#8208;layer fluorinated materials, SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA possesses a unique pillar&#8208;cage structure, in which the SiF62&#8722; anions cross&#8208;link two adjacent metal nodes as pillars to stabilize the three&#8208;dimensional framework constructed by icosahedral and tetrahedral cages. As anticipated, SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA has high BET surface area (1330&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) as well as high C2H2 uptake (185&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar). At the same time, due to the obvious difference in the adsorption performance of CO2 and C2H2 especially in the low pressure area, SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA also exhibits an excellent C2H2/CO2 separation performance (breakthrough time up to 68&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar).

A new non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated group, (NH2SO3)&#8722;, was discovered by the first&#8208;principles calculation. By combining alkaline&#8208;earth metals with (NH2SO3)&#8722; group, two deep&#8208;UV transparent NLO sulfamates, M(NH2SO3)2 (M=Sr, Ba) with excellent optical properties have been successfully synthesized and grown.

Abstract
Over the last few decades, the development of each new nonlinear optical (NLO)&#8208;active functional unit has led to the discoveries of a series of excellent NLO materials. In the present work, based on first&#8208;principles studies, we identified a novel deep&#8208;UV (DUV) NLO&#8208;active functional unit, a non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated group viz. (NH2SO3)&#8722;. By combining alkaline&#8208;earth metals with (NH2SO3)&#8722; group, two DUV transparent NLO sulfamates, M(NH2SO3)2 (M=Sr, Ba) with superior optical properties including strong SHG responses (1.2 and 2.7 &#215; KH2PO4 (KDP)), short UV cut&#8208;off edge (&lt;190&#8197;nm) and moderate birefringence (0.056@589.3&#8197;nm for Sr(NH2SO3)2) were successfully synthesized. Our work has provided not only two promising DUV transparent NLO crystals, but also an innovative non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated unit for developing more DUV transparent NLO materials.

         <title>Template&#8208;Mediated Control over Polymorphism in the Vapor&#8208;Assisted Formation of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Powders and Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7553-7558, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A template&#8208;mediated MOF&#8208;CVD (metal&#8212;organic framework&#8208;chemical vapor deposition) method was developed for the syntheses of MOFs in both powder and thin&#8208;film forms. The time&#8208;resolved in situ synchrotron small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals that introducing template vapor into the MOF&#8208;CVD process precludes transformation into a dense phase, thus resulting in the porous structure.







Abstract
The landscape of possible polymorphs for some metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can pose a challenge for controlling the outcome of their syntheses. Demonstrated here is the use of a template to control in the vapor&#8208;assisted formation of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) powders and thin films. Introducing a small amount of either ethanol or dimethylformamide vapor during the reaction between ZnO and 4,5&#8208;dichloroimidazole vapor results in the formation of the porous ZIF&#8208;71 phase, whereas other conditions lead to the formation of the dense ZIF&#8208;72 phase or amorphous materials.

     alt="Template&#8208;Mediated Control over Polymorphism in the Vapor&#8208;Assisted Formation of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Powders and Films"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A template&#8208;mediated MOF&#8208;CVD (metal&#8212;organic framework&#8208;chemical vapor deposition) method was developed for the syntheses of MOFs in both powder and thin&#8208;film forms. The time&#8208;resolved in situ synchrotron small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals that introducing template vapor into the MOF&#8208;CVD process precludes transformation into a dense phase, thus resulting in the porous structure.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landscape of possible polymorphs for some metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can pose a challenge for controlling the outcome of their syntheses. Demonstrated here is the use of a template to control in the vapor&#8208;assisted formation of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) powders and thin films. Introducing a small amount of either ethanol or dimethylformamide vapor during the reaction between ZnO and 4,5&#8208;dichloroimidazole vapor results in the formation of the porous ZIF&#8208;71 phase, whereas other conditions lead to the formation of the dense ZIF&#8208;72 phase or amorphous materials. Time&#8208;resolved in situ small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals that the porous phase is metastable and can be transformed into its dense polymorph. This transformation is avoided through the introduction of template vapor. The porosity of the resulting ZIF powders and films was studied by N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Kr physisorption, as well as positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. The templating principle was demonstrated for other members of the ZIF family as well, including the ZIF&#8208;7 series, ZIF&#8208;8_Cl, and ZIF&#8208;8_Br.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Boric Acid&#8208;Fueled ATP Synthesis by FoF1 ATP Synthase Reconstituted in a Supramolecular Architecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7617-7620, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boric acid is explored as a fuel for tuneable ATP synthesis in a biomimetic supramolecular architecture. A proton is released from boric acid by a polyol, establishing a cross&#8208;membrane proton gradient to achieve highly efficient ATP production. The assembled system integrates artificial and natural processes, holding promise in applications that require ATP.







Abstract
Significant strides toward producing biochemical fuels have been achieved by mimicking natural oxidative and photosynthetic phosphorylation. Here, different from these strategies, we explore boric acid as a fuel for tuneable synthesis of energy&#8208;storing molecules in a cell&#8208;like supramolecular architecture. Specifically, a proton locked in boric acid is released in a modulated fashion by the choice of polyols. As a consequence, controlled proton gradients across the lipid membrane are established to drive ATP synthase embedded in the biomimetic architecture, which facilitates tuneable ATP production. This strategy paves a unique route to achieve highly efficient bioenergy conversion, holding broad applications in synthesis and devices that require biochemical fuels.

         <title>Melanin&#8208;Inspired Chromophoric Microparticles Composed of Polymeric Peptide Pigments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7564-7569, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by melanin diversity and biosynthesis, a method to produce melanin&#8208;like microparticles as a reactive scaffold for subsequent oxidative incorporation of amino acids was developed. The spontaneous formation of distinct new chromophores with optical properties that are far beyond the range of those found in biological melanins, in terms of color, UV absorbance and fluorescent emission is demonstrated.







Abstract
Melanin and related polyphenolic pigments are versatile functional polymers that serve diverse aesthetic and protective roles across the living world. These polymeric pigments continue to inspire the development of adhesive, photonic, electronic and radiation&#8208;protective materials and coatings. The properties of these structures are dictated by covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions in ways that, despite progress, are not fully understood. It remains a major challenge to direct oxidative polymerization of their precursors (amino acids, (poly&#8208;)phenols, thiols) toward specific structures. By taking advantage of supramolecular pre&#8208;organization of tyrosine&#8208;tripeptides and reactive sequestering of selected amino acids during enzymatic oxidation, we demonstrate the spontaneous formation of distinct new chromophores with optical properties that are far beyond the range of those found in biological melanins, in terms of color, UV absorbance and fluorescent emission.

         <title>Characterization and Mechanistic Study of the Radical SAM Enzyme ArsS Involved in Arsenosugar Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7570-7575, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report characterization of ArsS as a DDMAA synthase, which catalyzes a radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM)&#8208;mediated alkylation (adenosylation) of dimethylarsenite (DMAsIII) to produce DDMAA. This radical&#8208;mediated reaction is redox neutral, and multiple turnover can be achieved without external reductant. This study reveals a key step in arsenosugar biosynthesis and also a new paradigm in radical SAM chemistry.







Abstract
Arsenosugars are a group of arsenic&#8208;containing ribosides that are found predominantly in marine algae but also in terrestrial organisms. It has been proposed that arsenosugar biosynthesis involves a key intermediate 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;dimethylarsinoyl&#8208;adenosine (DDMAA), but how DDMAA is produced remains elusive. Now, we report characterization of ArsS as a DDMAA synthase, which catalyzes a radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM)&#8208;mediated alkylation (adenosylation) of dimethylarsenite (DMAsIII) to produce DDMAA. This radical&#8208;mediated reaction is redox neutral, and multiple turnover can be achieved without external reductant. Phylogenomic and biochemical analyses revealed that DDMAA synthases are widespread in distinct bacterial phyla with similar catalytic efficiencies; these enzymes likely originated from cyanobacteria. This study reveals a key step in arsenosugar biosynthesis and also a new paradigm in radical SAM chemistry, highlighting the catalytic diversity of this superfamily of enzymes.

         <title>Inversely Tuning the CO2 Electroreduction and Hydrogen Evolution Activity on Metal Oxide via Heteroatom Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7602-7606, March 29, 2021. </description>

Replacing Zn sites by heteroatoms with different outer electrons (Mo and Cu) creates various new near the Fermi level electronic states in ZnO. The different electronic states significantly tune both CO2RR and HER activity with an inverse trend. This work provides a possibility for engineering efficient metal&#8208;compound based CO2RR eletrocatalysts through tunable composition and electronic structures.







Abstract
Tuning the electronic states near the Fermi level can effectively facilitate the reaction kinetics. However, elucidating the role of a specific electronic state of metal oxide in simultaneously regulating the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) and competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still rare, making it difficult to accurately predict the practical CO2RR performance. Herein, replacing the Zn site by heteroatoms with different outer electrons (Mo and Cu) is found to tune both occupied and unoccupied orbitals near the Fermi level of ZnO. Moreover, the different electronic states significantly modulate both CO2RR and HER activity with a totally inverse trend, thus dramatically tuning the practical CO2RR performance. In parallel, the correlation between electronic states, reaction free energies and practical activity is demonstrated. This work provides a possibility for engineering efficient CO2RR eletrocatalysts through tunable composition and electronic structures.

Combining reactivity, NMR spectroscopy and structural studies has cleared the mist surrounding the complex constitutions of mixed Li&#8211;Mg, mixed alkyl&#8211;alkoxo complexes used in metal&#8211;bromine exchange reactions.







Abstract
While it is known that the addition of Group 1 alkoxides to s&#8208;block organometallics can have an activating effect on reactivity, the exact nature of this effect is not that well understood. Here we describe the activation of sBu2Mg towards substituted bromoarenes by adding one equivalent of LiOR (R=2&#8208;ethylhexyl), where unusually both sBu groups can undergo efficient Br/Mg exchange. Depending on the substitution pattern on the bromoarene two different types of organometallic intermediates have been isolated, either a mixed aryl/alkoxide [{LiMg(2&#8208;FG&#8208;C6H4)2(OR)}2] (FG=OMe; NMe2) or a homoaryl [(THF)4Li2Mg(4&#8208;FG&#8208;C6H4)4] (FG=OMe, F). Detailed NMR spectroscopic studies have revealed that these exchange reactions and the formation of their intermediates are controlled by a new type of bimetallic Schlenk&#8208;type equilibrium between heteroleptic [LiMgsBu2(OR)], alkyl rich [Li2MgsBu4] and Mg(OR)2, with [Li2MgsBu4] being the active species performing the Br/Mg exchange process.

         <dc:description>We report here a facile and generalized approach to the modification of solid surfaces with polymer brushes under ambient conditions: filter paper&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;initiated Cu(0)&#8208;mediated controlled radical polymerization (PSI&#8208;CuCRP). The polymerization solution wetted filter paper with the copper plate allows creation of a surface&#8208;initiated polymerization (SIP) &#8220;band&#8208;aid&#8221; that anyone can perform the surface grafting selectively with good control over the quality of the polymer brushes employing low concentration and microliter amounts of monomer solution. The versatility of this method is demonstrated by grafting different homo&#8208;, block&#8208; and multicomponent polymer brushes by using the same activation system and reaction conditions, the polymerization process can be precisely controlled to yield uniform polymers and show high chain&#8208;end functionality which is exempli&#64257;ed by  in situ  tetra&#8208;copolymerization. The combination of photolithography and paper cutting enables to prepare arbitrary three&#8208;dimensional patterned polymer brushes on the surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutralizing Aptamers Block S/RBD&#8208;ACE2 Interactions and Prevent Host Cell Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic ssDNA aptamers containing a conserved sequence motif that specifically targets the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike have the capacity to neutralize the virus and prevent host cell infection in vitro, suggesting a new therapeutic approach to treat COVID&#8208;19.







Abstract
The receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike (S) protein plays a central role in mediating the first step of virus infection to cause disease: virus binding to angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on human host cells. Therefore, S/RBD is an ideal target for blocking and neutralization therapies to prevent and treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19). Using a target&#8208;based selection approach, we developed oligonucleotide aptamers containing a conserved sequence motif that specifically targets S/RBD. Synthetic aptamers had high binding affinity for S/RBD&#8208;coated virus mimics (KD&#8776;7&#8197;nM) and also blocked interaction of S/RBD with ACE2 receptors (IC50&#8776;5&#8197;nM). Importantly, aptamers were able to neutralize S protein&#8208;expressing viral particles and prevent host cell infection, suggesting a promising COVID&#8208;19 therapy strategy.

         <title>Metavalent Bonding in GeSe Leads to High Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural transformation of GeSe is associated with a change in nature of the chemical bonding from covalent bonding in pristine orthorhombic GeSe to metavalent bonding in rhombohedral (GeSe)1&#8722;x(AgBiTe2)x. Metavalent bonding and ferroelectric instability lead to high thermoelectric performance in the rhombohedral p&#8208;type polycrystalline (GeSe)1&#8722;x(AgBiTe2)x.







Abstract
Orthorhombic GeSe is a promising thermoelectric material. However, large band gap and strong covalent bonding result in a low thermoelectric figure of merit, zT&#8776;0.2. Here, we demonstrate a maximum zT&#8776;1.35 at 627&#8197;K in p&#8208;type polycrystalline rhombohedral (GeSe)0.9(AgBiTe2)0.1&#8201;, which is the highest value reported among GeSe based materials. The rhombohedral phase is stable in ambient conditions for x=0.8&#8211;0.29 in (GeSe)1&#8722;x(AgBiTe2)x&#8201;. The structural transformation accompanies change from covalent bonding in orthorhombic GeSe to metavalent bonding in rhombohedral (GeSe)1&#8722;x(AgBiTe2)x&#8201;. (GeSe)0.9(AgBiTe2)0.1 has closely lying primary and secondary valence bands (within 0.25&#8211;0.30&#8197;eV), which results in high power factor 12.8&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 at 627&#8197;K. It also exhibits intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity (0.38&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 578&#8197;K). Theoretical phonon dispersion calculations reveal vicinity of a ferroelectric instability, with large anomalous Born effective charges and high optical dielectric constant, which, in concurrence with high effective coordination number, low band gap and moderate electrical conductivity, corroborate metavalent bonding in (GeSe)0.9(AgBiTe2)0.1. We confirmed the presence of low energy phonon modes and local ferroelectric domains using heat capacity measurement (3&#8211;30&#8197;K) and switching spectroscopy in piezoresponse force microscopy, respectively.

         <title>Conjugated Nanohoops Incorporating Donor, Acceptor, Hetero&#8208; or Polycyclic Aromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designer hoops: By incorporating aromatic units with specific electronic (i.e. donor/acceptor) or structural (i.e. chirality) properties, it is possible to modify cycloparaphenylenes and conjugated hoops according to design. This Review provides an overview of such structurally designed hoops, their structural, optoelectronic, and host properties, and potential (future) applications.







Abstract
In the last 13&#8197;years several synthetic strategies were developed that provide access to [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) and related conjugated nanohoops. A number of potential applications emerged, including optoelectronic devices, and their use as templates for carbon nanomaterials and in supramolecular chemistry. To tune the structural or optoelectronic properties of carbon nanohoops beyond the size&#8208;dependent effect known for [n]CPPs, a variety of aromatic rings other than benzene were introduced. In this Review, we provide an overview of the syntheses, properties, and applications of conjugated nanohoops beyond [n]CPPs with intrinsic donor/acceptor structure or such that contain acceptor, donor, heteroaromatic or polycyclic aromatic units within the hoop as well as conjugated nanobelts.

         <title>Hydrolysis of Aliphatic Bis&#8208;isonitriles in the Presence of a Polar Super Aryl&#8208;Extended Calix[4]pyrrole Container</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole acts as both a sequestering and supramolecular protecting group, enhancing the selectivity for the mono&#8208;formamide product in the hydrolysis of aliphatic bis&#8208;isonitriles.







Abstract
We report binding studies of an octa&#8208;pyridinium super aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole receptor with neutral difunctional aliphatic guests in water. The guests have terminal isonitrile and formamide groups, and the complexes display an inclusion binding geometry and 1:1 stoichiometry. Using 1H&#8197;NMR titrations and ITC experiments, we characterized the dissimilar thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the complexes. The bis&#8208;isonitriles possess independent reacting groups, however, in the presence of 1&#8197;equiv of the receptor the hydrolysis reaction produces mixtures of non&#8208;statistical composition and a significant decrease in reaction rates. The selectivity for the mono&#8208;formamide product is specially enhanced in the case of the bis&#8208;isonitrile having a spacer with five methylene groups. The analysis of the kinetic data suggests that the observed modifications in reaction rates and selectivity are related to the formation of highly stable inclusion complexes in which the isonitrile is hidden from bulk water molecules. The concentration of the reacting substrates in the bulk solution is substantially reduced by binding to the receptor. In turn, the hydrolysis rates of the isonitrile groups for the bound substrates are slower than in the bulk solution. The receptor acts as both a sequestering and supramolecular protecting group.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Asymmetric Aminoazidation and Diazidation of Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric aminoazidation and diazidation of alkenes are straightforward strategies to build value&#8208;added chiral nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds from feedstock chemicals. They provide direct access to chiral organoazides and complement enantioselective diamination. Notwithstanding the advances in non&#8208;asymmetric reactions, asymmetric aminoazidation or diazidation based on acyclic systems have not been previously reported. Here we describe the iron&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular asymmetric aminoazidation and diazidation of styrenes. The method is practically useful and requires relatively low loading of catalyst and chiral ligand. With mild reaction conditions, the reaction can be completed on a 20 mmol scale. Studies of the mechanism suggest that the reaction proceeds  via  a radical pathway and involves stereocontrol of an acyclic free radical which probably takes place through a group transfer mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Following Electroenzymatic Hydrogen Production by Rotating Ring&#8211;Disk Electrochemistry and Mass Spectrometry**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metalloenzymes are of interest for biotechnology and bioinspired catalyst design. The use of rotating ring&#8211;disk electrochemistry and on&#8208;line mass spectrometry is reported for following electroenzymatic hydrogen formation and isotopic product distribution.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;processing metalloenzymes are of interest to future bio&#8208; and bioinspired technologies. Of particular importance are hydrogenases and nitrogenases, which both produce molecular hydrogen (H2) from proton (H+) reduction. Herein, we report on the use of rotating ring&#8211;disk electrochemistry (RRDE) and mass spectrometry (MS) to follow the production of H2 and isotopes produced from deuteron (D+) reduction (HD and D2) using the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum, a model hydrogen&#8208;evolving metalloenzyme. This facilitates enzymology studies independent of non&#8208;innocent chemical reductants. We anticipate that these approaches will be of value in resolving the catalytic mechanisms of H2&#8208;producing metalloenzymes and the design of bioinspired catalysts for H2 production and N2 fixation.

         <title>Lipopolysaccharide from Gut&#8208;Associated Lymphoid&#8208;Tissue&#8208;Resident Alcaligenes faecalis: Complete Structure Determination and Chemical Synthesis of Its Lipid&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A host&#8211;microbe chemical ecology study revealed an effective and safe immunomodulator from Alcaligenes faecalis resident in gut&#8208;associated lymphoid tissues, Peyer's patches (see picture). The complete structures of both the lipooligosaccharide and the lipopolysaccharide from A.&#8197;faecalis were characterized. Furthermore, A.&#8197;faecalis lipid&#8197;A molecules were synthesized with varying degrees of acylation and found to be a promising vaccine adjuvant candidate.







Abstract
Alcaligenes faecalis is the predominant Gram&#8208;negative bacterium inhabiting gut&#8208;associated lymphoid tissues, Peyer's patches. We previously reported that an A.&#8197;faecalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) acted as a weak agonist for Toll&#8208;like receptor&#8197;4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor&#8208;2 (MD&#8208;2) receptor as well as a potent inducer of IgA without excessive inflammation, thus suggesting that A.&#8197;faecalis LPS might be used as a safe adjuvant. In this study, we characterized the structure of both the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) and LPS from A.&#8197;faecalis. We synthesized three lipid&#8197;A molecules with different degrees of acylation by an efficient route involving the simultaneous introduction of 1&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphates. Hexaacylated A.&#8197;faecalis lipid&#8197;A showed moderate agonistic activity towards TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling and the ability to elicit a discrete interleukin&#8208;6 release in human cell lines and mice. It was thus found to be the active principle of the LOS/LPS and a promising vaccine adjuvant candidate.

We previously reported that an &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;faecalis&lt;/i&gt; lipopolysaccharide (LPS) acted as a weak agonist for Toll&#8208;like receptor&#8197;4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor&#8208;2 (MD&#8208;2) receptor as well as a potent inducer of IgA without excessive inflammation, thus suggesting that &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;faecalis&lt;/i&gt; LPS might be used as a safe adjuvant. In this study, we characterized the structure of both the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) and LPS from &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;faecalis&lt;/i&gt;. We synthesized three lipid&#8197;A molecules with different degrees of acylation by an efficient route involving the simultaneous introduction of 1&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphates. Hexaacylated &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;faecalis&lt;/i&gt; lipid&#8197;A showed moderate agonistic activity towards TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling and the ability to elicit a discrete interleukin&#8208;6 release in human cell lines and mice. It was thus found to be the active principle of the LOS/LPS and a promising vaccine adjuvant candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Precise Pore Space Partitions Combined with High&#8208;Density Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Acceptors within Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient Acetylene Storage and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benchmark metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) adsorbents for C2H2/CO2 separation are reported. The MOFs offer moderate pore size distributions, which are regulated by precise pore space partitions and coupled with a high&#8208;density of hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptors.







Abstract
The high storage capacity versus high selectivity trade&#8208;off barrier presents a daunting challenge to practical application as an acetylene (C2H2) adsorbent. A structure&#8211;performance relationship screening for sixty&#8208;two high&#8208;performance metal&#8211;organic framework adsorbents reveals that a moderate pore size distribution around 5.0&#8211;7.5&#8197;&#197; is critical to fulfill this task. A precise pore space partition approach was involved to partition 1D hexagonal channels of typical MIL&#8208;88 architecture into finite segments with pore sizes varying from 4.5&#8197;&#197; (SNNU&#8208;26) to 6.4&#8197;&#197; (SNNU&#8208;27), 7.1&#8197;&#197; (SNNU&#8208;28), and 8.1&#8197;&#197; (SNNU&#8208;29). Coupled with bare tetrazole N sites (6 or 12 bare N sites within one cage) as high&#8208;density H&#8208;bonding acceptors for C2H2, the target MOFs offer a good combination of high C2H2/CO2 adsorption selectivity and high C2H2 uptake capacity in addition to good stability. The optimized SNNU&#8208;27&#8208;Fe material demonstrates a C2H2 uptake of 182.4&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an extraordinary C2H2/CO2 dynamic breakthrough time up to 91&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1 under ambient conditions.

         <title>Discovery of Cyanobacterial Natural Products Containing Fatty Acid Residues**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of hapalosin analogues and several 1,2,3&#8208;oxadiazine&#8208;lactylate hybrids were discovered by exploiting the apparent inability of cyanobacteria to degrade fatty acids. When supplemented with perdeuterated fatty acids, cyanobacteria incorporate their residues into secondary metabolites, which can then be swiftly detected by LC&#8208;MS analysis.







Abstract
In recent years, extensive sequencing and annotation of bacterial genomes has revealed an unexpectedly large number of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters whose products are yet to be discovered. For example, cyanobacterial genomes contain a variety of gene clusters that likely incorporate fatty acid derived moieties, but for most cases we lack the knowledge and tools to effectively predict or detect the encoded natural products. Here, we exploit the apparent absence of a functional &#946;&#8208;oxidation pathway in cyanobacteria to achieve efficient stable&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeling of their fatty acid derived lipidome. We show that supplementation of cyanobacterial cultures with deuterated fatty acids can be used to easily detect natural product signatures in individual strains. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated in two cultured cyanobacteria by uncovering analogues of the multidrug&#8208;resistance reverting hapalosin, and novel, cytotoxic, lactylate&#8208;nocuolin A hybrids&#8212;the nocuolactylates.

         <title>Free&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Membrane for High&#8208;Efficiency Salinity Gradient Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Free&#8208;standing covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;based membranes with excellent stability and mechanical properties were fabricated. The membranes have one&#8208;dimensional nanochannels for ion transport and they exhibit high conductivity and selectivity. The membranes demonstrated efficient salinity gradient energy conversion, which highlights the potential of covalent organic frameworks in energy harvesting.







Abstract
Both high ionic conductivity and selectivity of a membrane are required for efficient salinity gradient energy conversion. An efficient method to improve energy conversion is to align ionic transport along the membrane thickness to address low ionic conductivity in traditional membranes used for energy harvesting. We fabricated a free&#8208;standing covalent organic framework membrane (TpPa&#8208;SO3H) with excellent stability and mechanical properties. This membrane with one&#8208;dimensional nanochannels and high charge density demonstrated high ionic conductivity and selectivity. Its power density reached up to 5.9&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 by mixing artificial seawater and river water. Based on our results, we attribute the high energy conversion to the high ion conductivity through aligned one&#8208;dimensional nanochannels and high ion selectivity via the size of the nanochannel at &#8776;1&#8197;nm in the membrane. This study paves the way for designing covalent organic framework membranes for high salinity gradient energy conversion.

A gold catalyst promotes the sequential cleavage of S&#8722;O and N&#8722;S bonds of the sulfinyl group, leading to S&#8208;functionalized azirines. As Itaru Nakamura et&#8197;al. illustrate in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202100207), the transformation is like making plastic models: A golden diagonal plier cuts these bonds and the cut out parts are assembled into the product using an alkyne triple bond unit. Substituents in the product can be chosen from the kit as desired.

         <title>Selective Electrocatalytic Reduction of Oxygen to Hydroxyl Radicals via 3&#8208;Electron Pathway with FeCo Alloy Encapsulated Carbon Aerogel for Fast and Complete Removing Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxyl radicals are efficiently and continuously generated from selective electrochemical reduction O2 via 3&#8208;electron pathway with FeCoC electrode, overcoming the rate&#8208;limiting step of electron transfer initiated by reduction&#8208;/oxidation&#8208;state cycle. Fast and complete removal of organics with the apparent rate constant of 1.44&#177;0.04&#8197;min&#8722;1 represents high potential for practical water purification.







Abstract
We reported the selective electrochemical reduction of oxygen (O2) to hydroxyl radicals (.OH) via 3&#8208;electron pathway with FeCo alloy encapsulated by carbon aerogel (FeCoC). The graphite shell with exposed &#8208;COOH is conducive to the 2&#8208;electron reduction pathway for H2O2 generation stepped by 1&#8208;electron reduction towards to .OH. The electrocatalytic activity can be regulated by tuning the local electronic environment of carbon shell with the electrons coming from the inner FeCo alloy. The new strategy of .OH generation from electrocatalytic reduction O2 overcomes the rate&#8208;limiting step over electron transfer initiated by reduction&#8208;/oxidation&#8208;state cycle in Fenton process. Fast and complete removal of ciprofloxacin was achieved within 5&#8197;min in this proposed system, the apparent rate constant (kobs) was up to 1.44&#177;0.04&#8197;min&#8722;1, which is comparable with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advanced oxidation processes. The degradation rate almost remains the same after 50 successive runs, suggesting the satisfactory stability for practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Hydroxyl radicals are efficiently and continuously generated from selective electrochemical reduction O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via 3&#8208;electron pathway with FeCoC electrode, overcoming the rate&#8208;limiting step of electron transfer initiated by reduction&#8208;/oxidation&#8208;state cycle. Fast and complete removal of organics with the apparent rate constant of 1.44&#177;0.04&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; represents high potential for practical water purification.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reported the selective electrochemical reduction of oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to hydroxyl radicals (&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;OH) via 3&#8208;electron pathway with FeCo alloy encapsulated by carbon aerogel (FeCoC). The graphite shell with exposed &#8208;COOH is conducive to the 2&#8208;electron reduction pathway for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation stepped by 1&#8208;electron reduction towards to &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;OH. The electrocatalytic activity can be regulated by tuning the local electronic environment of carbon shell with the electrons coming from the inner FeCo alloy. The new strategy of &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;OH generation from electrocatalytic reduction O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; overcomes the rate&#8208;limiting step over electron transfer initiated by reduction&#8208;/oxidation&#8208;state cycle in Fenton process. Fast and complete removal of ciprofloxacin was achieved within 5&#8197;min in this proposed system, the apparent rate constant (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;) was up to 1.44&#177;0.04&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is comparable with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advanced oxidation processes. The degradation rate almost remains the same after 50 successive runs, suggesting the satisfactory stability for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Evidence of the Lewis&#8208;Amphoteric Character of Tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanide, [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable salts of the [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722; ion were isolated utilizing sterically demanding phosphazenium cations. Similar to Lewis amphoteric silylenes, the [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722; ion activates CO2 and adds side&#8208;on to CS2 allowing novel negatively charged species like 2 and 3 to be structurally characterized.







Abstract
According to a first view on the geometrical and electronic structure of the tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanide, this anion appears as a Lewis base. Quantum chemical calculations on perfluoroalkylated silanides show significantly lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels in comparison to their non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts, which implies reduced Lewis basicity and increased Lewis acidity of the [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722; ion. With these findings and a HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap of 4.80&#8197;eV similar to N&#8208;heterocyclic silylenes (NHSis), perfluoroalkyl silanides are predestined to exhibit Lewis&#8208;amphoteric character similar to silylenes. Deprotonation of Si(C2F5)3H with sterically demanding phosphazene bases afforded thermally stable phosphazenium salts of the [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722; anion, which add to benzaldehyde, benzophenone, CS2, and CO2 in various manners. This behavior also mirrors the reactivity of silylenes towards ketones as well as heterocumulenes and is rationalized by Lewis amphotericity being inherent in these silanides.

         <title>Isotopic Labelling of Confined Carbyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, 13C&#8208;labelling of confined carbyne is achieved by using 13C&#8208;labelled methanol as an extra carbon source filled inside carbon nanotubes for the construction of confined carbyne.







Abstract
Carbyne is a one&#8208;dimensional allotrope of carbon consisting of a linear chain of carbon atoms bonded to each other with exceptional strength. Its outstanding mechanical, optical, and electronic properties have been theoretically predicted, but its stability has only been achieved when grown encapsulated in the hollow core of carbon nanotubes. One of the advantages of this confinement is that its properties can be controlled by the chain's length and surrounding environment. We investigated an alternative way of gaining control of its properties is using isotope labelling as tuning mechanism. The optimized liquid precursor was first chosen among several options, which can greatly enhance the yield of the confined carbyne. Then isotopic labelled liquid precursor was encapsulated for further synthesis of isotopic labelled confined carbyne. This allowed us to obtain pioneering results on isotope engineered carbyne with around 11.9&#8201;% of 13C&#8208;labelling using 13C&#8208;methanol as precursor.

         <title>Sulfur in Amorphous Silica for an Advanced Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur as an electrode is loaded into amorphous silica by a facile dipping method. In charge/discharge process, the complex pores of amorphous silica, acting as micro&#8208;containers and the formation of Na&#8208;O chemical bonds between amorphous silica and sodium polysulfide, give the electrodes a strong ability to inhibit sodium polysulfide shuttle.







Abstract
The room&#8208;temperature (RT) Na/S battery is a promising energy storage system owing to suitable operating temperature, high theoretical energy density, and low cost. However, it has a poor cycle life and low reversible capacity. In this work, we report a long&#8208;life RT&#8208;Na/S battery with amorphous porous silica as a sulfur host. The sulfur is loaded into amorphous silica by a dipping method; the optimal sulfur loading is up to 73.48&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Molecular dynamics simulation and first&#8208;principles calculations suggest that the complex pores, acting as micro&#8208;containers and the formation of Na&#8208;O chemical bonds between amorphous silica and sodium polysulfide, give the electrodes a strong ability to inhibit sodium polysulfide shuttle. This would give rise to effectively avoiding the loss of active sulfur, corresponding to a superior capacity and an excellent cyclability even at 10&#8197;A&#8201;gsulfur&#8722;1 (nearly 100&#8201;% coulomb efficiency and high reversible capacity of 955.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;gsulfur&#8722;1 after 1460&#8197;cycles).

         <title>Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Boric Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amazing and unexpected long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence of boric acid (H3BO3) was unveiled by Peng Wu et al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202101923). Unlike traditional metallic inorganic or aromatic organic phosphors, the phosphorescence originates from the weak conjugation of lone pair electrons from O atoms. The vacant pz orbital of B and the regular arrangement in crystalline state with layer&#8208;like packing through abundant hydrogen bonding are found to contribute to the long&#8208;lived emission.

         <title>Selective Implantation of Diamines for Cooperative Catalysis in Isoreticular Heterometallic Titanium&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective grafting route for heterometallic MOFs is described by Carlos Mart&#237;&#8208;Gastaldo and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202100176). The different chemistry of Ti(IV) and Ca(II) sites is used to direct selective coordination of amines to the latter. This enables the combination of Lewis acid titanium centers and available &#8208;NH2 sites in two sizeable pores for cooperative cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

         <title>Redox Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Microporous Polymers as Ultralong&#8208;Lived Organic Anodes for Rechargeable Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated microporous polymer (AQ&#8208;CMP) featuring an interconnected octupole network is explored as efficient and ultra&#8208;robust anodes for rechargeable air batteries. Benefiting from high density of redox sites, favorable electron structures, highly cross&#8208;linked and porous character, the AQ&#8208;CMP anode is endowed with a close&#8208;to&#8208;theoretical capacity and unprecedented cycling stability with &#8776;100&#8201;% capacity retention after 60000 cycles.







Abstract
Herein, we explore a new redox donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated microporous polymer (AQ&#8208;CMP) by utilizing anthraquinone and benzene as linkers via C&#8208;C linkages and demonstrate the first use of CMP as ultralong&#8208;lived anodes for rechargeable air batteries. AQ&#8208;CMP features an interconnected octupole network, which affords not only favorable electronic structure for enhanced electron transport and n&#8208;doping activity compared to linear counterpart, but also high density of active sites for maximizing the formula&#8208;weight&#8208;based redox capability. This coupled with highly cross&#8208;linked and porous structure endows AQ&#8208;CMP with a specific capacity of 202&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (96&#8201;% of theoretical capacity) at 2&#8197;Ag&#8722;1 and &#8776;100&#8201;% capacity retention over 60000 charge/discharge cycles. The assembled CMP&#8208;air full cell shows a stable and high capacity with full capacity recovery after only refreshing cathodes, while the decoupled electrolyte and cathode design boosts the discharge voltage and voltage efficiency to &#8776;1&#8197;V and 87.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Low Power, Low Temperature and Atmospheric Pressure Plasma&#8208;Induced Polymerization: Facile Synthesis and Crystal Regulation of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low temperature and atmospheric pressure plasma&#8208;induced polymerization was demonstrated as a fast, facile, and acid catalyst&#8208;free strategy for tailoring of packing phase of COF&#8208;1 by fine&#8208;tuning the synthetic solvent as well as preparing diverse covalent organic frameworks including both two&#8208;dimensional boron&#8208;COFs, Schiff based&#8208;COFs, and three&#8208;dimensional COFs within one hour.







Abstract
Low temperature and atmospheric pressure plasma&#8208;induced polymerization was demonstrated as a fast and facile strategy for tailoring of packing phase of COF&#8208;1 as well as preparing diverse covalent organic frameworks (COFs) including both two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) COFs. By regulating the solvents, the fast construction of well&#8208;ordered AB staggered COF&#8208;1 and AA eclipsed COF&#8208;1 was facilely realized in minutes. The plasma approach presented here led to the rapid preparation of eight classical 2D COFs, including boronate ester&#8208;linkage (COF&#8208;5, COF&#8208;8 and COF&#8208;10), azine&#8208;linkage (NUS&#8208;2), &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linkage (TpPa, TPBD), imine&#8208;linkage (ILCOF&#8208;1, Py&#8208;COF), and 3D&#8208;COF&#8208;102 (boroxine linkage) in less than 1 hour. Different from conventional methods, the proposed methodology required much less time, lower power, no extra heating, inert&#8208;gas protection and pressure. The fast nucleation and growth of COFs with good crystallinity, morphology and thermal stability can be achieved under mild conditions.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Evidence for Promotional Effect of Acid Sites on the Diffusion of Alkenes through Small&#8208;Pore Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of a synergistic theoretical and experimental approach, Veronique Van&#8197;Speybroeck et&#8197;al. show in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202017025) that the presence of Br&#248;nsted acid sites promotes ethene diffusion through the cages of H&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34, whereas ethane diffusion remains invariant for the acid site density. The interaction of ethene with the acid sites (yellow dots) facilitates the diffusion through the catalyst, leading to a shorter diffusion path (blue pathway) compared to ethane which follows a random trajectory (orange pathway.

         <title>Uncovering Functional Motif of Nonlinear Optical Material by In Situ Electron Density and Wavefunction Studies Under Laser Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring nonlinear optical (NLO) functional motifs (FM, the structural origin of NLO efficiency) is vital for the rational design of NLO materials. Normal spectrum techniques applied in studying photon exciting materials are invalid for NLO materials, in which electrons are not excited substantially but only distorted under laser. A general strategy of determining NLO FM is proposed by comparative studies of experimental electron density (ED) without and under the laser. The  in situ  experimental ED and wavefunction of typical NLO material LiB  3  O  5  (LBO) under dark and 360 and 1064 nm lasers are investigated.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exploring nonlinear optical (NLO) functional motifs (FM, the structural origin of NLO efficiency) is vital for the rational design of NLO materials. Normal spectrum techniques applied in studying photon exciting materials are invalid for NLO materials, in which electrons are not excited substantially but only distorted under laser. A general strategy of determining NLO FM is proposed by comparative studies of experimental electron density (ED) without and under the laser.

         <title>Structural Analysis of an Antigen Chemically&#8208;Coupled on Virus&#8208;Like Particles in Vaccine Formulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structure determination of adjuvant&#8208;coupled antigens is essential for rational vaccine development but has so far been hampered by the relatively low antigen content in vaccine formulations and by their heterogeneous composition. Here we show that magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state NMR can be used to assess the structure of the influenza virus hemagglutinin stalk long alpha helix antigen, both in its free, unformulated form and once chemically coupled to the surface of large virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs). The sensitivity boost provided by high&#8208;field dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) and proton&#8208;detection at fast MAS rates allows to overcome the penalty associated to the antigen dilution. Comparison of the MAS NMR fingerprints between the free and VLP&#8208;coupled forms of the antigen provides structural evidence of the conservation of its native fold upon bio&#8208;conjugation. This work demonstrates that high&#8208;sensitivity MAS NMR is ripe to play a major role in vaccine design, formulation studies and manufacturing process development.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond the Classical Coordination Chemistry: The First Case of a Triply Bridging Phosphine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first example of a triply bridging (&#956;3&#8208;P) phosphine ligand has been discovered in the crown&#8208;shaped [Cu3(&#181;2&#8208;Hal)3L] (Hal = Cl, Br, or I) complexes supported by tris[2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)ethyl]phosphine (L). Theoretical analysis completely confirms the observed &#956;3&#8208;P&#8208;bridging pattern, revealing the interaction of the same lone pair of phosphorus with three valence 4s&#8208;orbitals of Cu atoms. The presented complexes exhibit outstanding blue phosphorescence (&#955;em  = 442&#8211;465 nm) with the quantum efficiency reaching 100%. The complex [Cu3(&#181;2&#8208;I)3L] also exhibits remarkable thermo&#8208; and mechanochromic luminescence resulting in a sharp change in the emission colour upon external stimuli. These findings essentially contribute to coordination chemistry of the pnictine ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Dicyclopentaannelated Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes with a Singlet Biradical Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two dicyclopentaannelated hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (PHBC) regioisomers have been synthesized from nonplanar oligoaryl precursors with fluorenyl groups: mPHBC 8 with two pentagons in the &#8220;meta&#8221;&#8208;configuration was obtained as a stable molecule, while its structural isomer with the &#8220;para&#8221;&#8208;configuration, pPHBC 16, could be prepared and characterized only in situ due to its high chemical reactivity. Both PHBCs exhibit low energy gaps, as reflected by UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR absorption and electrochemical measurements. They also show open&#8208;shell singlet ground states according to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The use of fully benzenoid HBC as a bridging moiety leads to significant singlet biradical characters (y0) of 0.72 and 0.96 for mPHBC 8 and pPHBC 16, respectively, due to the strong rearomatization tendency of the HBC p&#8208;system; these values are among the highest for planar carbon&#8208;centered biradical molecules. The incorporation of fully unsaturated pentagons strongly strongly perturbs the aromaticity of the parent HBC and makes the constituted benzene rings less aromatic or antiaromatic. These results illustrate the high impact of cyclopentaannelation on the electronic structures of fully benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and open up a new avenue towards open&#8208;shell PAHs with prominent singlet biradical characters.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemo&#8208;enzymatic modification of the 5&#8242; cap maintains translation and increases immunogenic properties of mRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Eukaryotic mRNAs are emerging modalities for protein replacement therapy and vaccination. Their 5&#8242; cap is important for mRNA translation and immune response and can be naturally methylated at different positions by S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (AdoMet)&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTases). We report on the cosubstrate scope of the MTase CAPAM responsible for methylation at the N6 position of adenosine start nucleotides using synthetic AdoMet analogs. The chemo&#8208;enzymatic propargylation enabled production of site&#8208;specifically modified reporter&#8208;mRNAs. These cap&#8208;propargylated mRNAs were efficiently translated and showed ~3&#8208;fold increased immune response in human cells. The same effects were observed when the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 &#8211; a currently tested epitope for mRNA vaccination &#8211; was used. Site&#8208;specific chemo&#8208;enzymatic modification of eukaryotic mRNA may thus be a suitable strategy to modulate translation and immune response of mRNAs for future therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical evolution of antivirals against enterovirus D68 through protein&#8208;templated Knoevenagel reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The generation of bioactive molecules from inactive precursors is a crucial step in the chemical evolution of life, however, mechanistic insights into this aspect of abiogenesis are scarce. Here, we investigate the protein&#8208;catalyzed formation of antivirals by the 3C&#8208;protease of enterovirus D68. The enzyme induces aldol condensations yielding inhibitors with antiviral activity in cells. Kinetic and thermodynamic analyses reveal that the bioactivity emerges from a dynamic reaction system including inhibitor formation, alkylation of the protein target by the inhibitors, and competitive addition of non&#8208;protein nucleophiles to the inhibitors. The most active antivirals are slowly reversible inhibitors with elongated target residence times. The study reveals first examples for the chemical evolution of bio&#8208;actives through protein&#8208;catalyzed, non&#8208;enzymatic CC&#8208;couplings. The discovered mechanism works under physiological conditions and might constitute a native process of drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Absolute Configuration Determination from Low ee Compounds by the Crystalline Sponge Method. Unusual Conglomerate Formation in a Pre&#8208;Determined Crystalline Lattice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When chiral compounds with low enantiomeric excess (ee, R:S = m:n) were absorbed into the void of the crystalline sponge (CS), enantiomerically pure [(R)  m  (S)  n  ] chiral composites were formed, changing the centrosymmetric space group into non&#8208;centrosymmetric one. The absolute configuration of the analyte compounds was elucidated with a reasonable Flack (Parsons) parameter value. This phenomenon is characteristic to the &#8220;post&#8208;crystallization" in the pre&#8208;determined CS crystalline lattice, seldom found in common crystallization where the crystalline lattice is defined by an analyte itself. The results highlight the potential of the CS method for absolute configuration determination of low ee samples, an often encountered situation in asymmetric synthesis studies.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;performance Unfused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Noncovalent Intramolecular Interactions and End Group Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (UREAs) have attracted much attention in recent years due to their advantages of simple synthetic routes, high yields and low costs. However, the efficiencies of UREAs based organic solar cells (OSCs) are still far behind those of fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (FREAs). Herein, a series of UREAs with S&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#160;noncovalent intramolecular interactions were designed and synthesized with a two&#8208;step synthetic route. Upon introducing  &#960;  &#8208;extended end&#8208;groups into the backbones, the electronic properties, charge transport, film morphology, and energy loss were precisely tuned by fine&#8208;tuning the degree of multi&#8208;fluorination. As a result, a record PCE of 14.53% in labs and a certified PCE of 13.8% for UREAs based devices were obtained. This contribution demonstrated that combining the strategies of noncovalent conformational locks and  &#960;  &#8208;extended end&#8208;group engineering is a simple and effective way to explore high&#8208;performance UREAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Micron&#8208;Scale Spiral Self&#8208;Assembly in Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymer Film with Controllable Chiral Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spiral is a fundamental structure in nature and spiral structures with controllable handedness are of increasing interest in the design of new chiroptical materials. In this study, micron&#8208;scale spiral structures with reversible chirality were fabricated based on the assembly of a liquid crystalline block copolymer film assisted by enantiopure tartaric acid. Mechanistic insight revealed that the formation of the spiral structures was closely related to the liquid crystalline properties of the major phase of block copolymer under the action of chiral tartaric acid. The chiral spiral structures with controllable handedness were easily erased under ultraviolet light irradiation and restored via thermal annealing. This facile thermal treatment method provides guidance for fabrication of chiral micron&#8208;scale spiral structures with adjustable chiral properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) organic emitters bearing small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) are of general interest in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Indolo[3,2,1&#8208;  jk  ]carbazole (ICz) embedded MR&#8208;fluorophors have demonstrated extremely small FWHMs, yet in the violet region with low electroluminescence efficiency. Herein, a strategic implementation of ICz subunits into MR fluorophors is proposed by taking advantage of the synergetic effect of  para  &#8208;positioned nitrogen atoms to enhance electronic coupling to decrease emitting energy gap. Deep blue emitters peaking at 441 and 447 nm with FWHMs of only 18 and 21 nm are thereof obtained respectively, accompanied by ~90% photo&#8208;luminance quantum yields. With the assistance of a thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer to recycle excitons, the corresponding narrowband electroluminescent devices show unprecedent high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 32.0% and 34.7% with CIE  y  of 0.10 and 0.085, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer Switches Regulated by Post&#8208;Transition/Transition Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduced an aptamer switch design that relies on the ability of post&#8208;transition/transition metal ions to trigger, through their coordination to nucleobases, substantial DNA destabilization. In the absence of molecular target, the addition of one such metal ion to usual aptamer working solutions promotes the formation of an alternative, inert DNA state. Upon exposure to the cognate compound, the equilibrium is shifted towards the competent DNA form. The switching process was preferentially activated by metal ions of intermediate base over phosphate complexation preference (  i.e.  Pb  2+  , Cd  2+  ) and operated with diversely structured DNA molecules. This very simple aptamer switch scheme was applied to the detection of small organics using the fluorescence anisotropy readout mode. We envision that the approach could be adapted to a variety of signalling methods that report on changes in the surface charge density of DNA receptors</dc:description>

         <title>General, Divergent Platform for Diastereoselective Synthesis of trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes with High Reactivity and Favorable Physiochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>trans  &#8208;Cyclooctenes (TCOs) are essential partners for the fastest known bioorthogonal reactions, but current synthetic methods are limited by poor diastereoselectivity. &#160;Especially hard to access are hydrophilic TCOs with favorable physicochemical properties for live cell or  in vivo  experiments. &#160;Described is a new class of TCOs, &#8216;a&#8208;TCOs&#8217;, that is prepared in high yield via stereocontrolled 1,2&#8208;additions of nucleophiles to trans&#8208;cyclooct&#8208;4&#8208;enone, which itself was prepared on large scale in two steps from 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene. Computational transition state models rationalize the diastereoselectivity of 1,2&#8208;additions to deliver a&#8208;TCO products, which were also shown to be more reactive than standard TCOs and less hydrophobic than even a  trans  &#8208;oxocene analog. &#160;Illustrating the favorable physicochemical properties of a&#8208;TCOs, a fluorescent TAMRA derivative in live HeLa cells was shown to be cell&#8208;permeable through intracellular Diels&#8208;Alder chemistry and to washout more rapidly than other TCOs.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Oxygen Reduction Selectivity through Steric Effects: Electrocatalytic Two&#8208;Electron and Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction with Cobalt Porphyrin Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving a&#160; s elective 2e  &#8722;  &#160;or 4e  &#8722;  &#160;oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical but challenging. Herein, we report controlling ORR selectivity of Co porphyrins by tuning only steric effects. We designed Co porphyrin&#160;  1  &#160;with&#160;  meso  &#8208;phenyls each bearing a bulky&#160;  ortho  &#8208;amido group. Due to the resulted steric hinderance,&#160;  1  &#160;has four atropisomers with similar electronic structures but dissimilar steric effects. Isomers&#160;  &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;  &#160;and&#160;  &#945;&#945;&#945;&#945;  &#160;catalyze ORR with&#160;  n  &#160;= 2.10 and 3.75 (  n  is the electron number transferred per O  2  ), respectively, but&#160;  &#945;&#945;&#946;&#946;  &#160;and&#160;  &#945;&#945;&#945;&#946;  &#160;show poor selectivity with&#160;  n  &#160;= 2.89&#8208;3.10. Isomer&#160;  &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;  &#160;catalyzes 2e  &#8722;  &#160;ORR by preventing a bimolecular O  2  &#160;activation path, while&#160;  &#945;&#945;&#945;&#945;  &#160;improves 4e  &#8722;  &#160;ORR selectivity by improving O  2  &#160;binding at its pocket, a feature confirmed by spectroscopy methods, including&#160; O K&#8208;edge &#160;near&#8208;edge&#160; X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure . This work represents an unparalleled example to improve 2e  &#8722;  &#160;and 4e  &#8722;  &#160;ORR by tuning only steric effects without changing molecular and electronic structures.</dc:description>

Isomers&#160;  &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;  &#160;and&#160;  &#945;&#945;&#945;&#945;  &#160;catalyze ORR with&#160;  n  &#160;= 2.10 and 3.75 (  n  is the electron number transferred per O  2  ), respectively, but&#160;  &#945;&#945;&#946;&#946;  &#160;and&#160;  &#945;&#945;&#945;&#946;  &#160;show poor selectivity with&#160;  n  &#160;= 2.89&#8208;3.10. Isomer&#160;  &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;  &#160;catalyzes 2e  &#8722;  &#160;ORR by preventing a bimolecular O  2  &#160;activation path, while&#160;  &#945;&#945;&#945;&#945;  &#160;improves 4e  &#8722;  &#160;ORR selectivity by improving O  2  &#160;binding at its pocket, a feature confirmed by spectroscopy methods, including&#160; O K&#8208;edge &#160;near&#8208;edge&#160; X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure . This work represents an unparalleled example to improve 2e  &#8722;  &#160;and 4e  &#8722;  &#160;ORR by tuning only steric effects without changing molecular and electronic structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dithienylethene Based Photochromic Siloles: a Straightforward and Divergent Synthetic Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract  : A straightforward synthetic methodology for the preparation of photochromic siloles based on the dithienylethene motif is developed. It relies upon an efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of a 2,3&#8208;bis(3&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;silirene with terminal alkynes in mild conditions. The reaction is functional group&#8208;tolerant and can be performed in high yields with a variety of functional terminal alkynes. It can even be extended to a polymeric polypropargylmethacrylamide (  PPMA  ) substrate affording the corresponding photochromic polymer with different degree of photochromic unit incorporation by simply adjusting the polymer / silirene stoichiometric ratio.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge&#8208;reversible surfactant&#8208;induced transformation between oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions and Pickering emulsions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel charge&#8208;reversible surfactant, (CH  3  )  2  N&#8208;(CH  2  )  10  COONa, was designed and synthesized, which together with silica nanoparticles can stabilize a smart  n  &#8208;octane&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsion responsive to pH. At high pH (9.3) the surfactant is anionic carboxylate, which together with the negatively charged silica nanoparticles co&#8208;stabilize flowable oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions, whereas at low pH (4.1) it is turned to cationic form by forming amine salt which can hydrophobize  in situ  the negatively charged silica nanoparticles to stabilize viscous oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (O/W) Pickering emulsions. At neutral pH (7.5), however, this surfactant is converted to zwitterionic form, which only weakly hydrophobises the silica particles to stabilize O/W Pickering emulsions of large droplet size. Moreover, demulsification can be achieved rapidly triggered by pH. With this strategy particles can be controlled either dispersed in water or adsorbed at the oil&#8208;water interface endowing emulsions with the capacity for intelligent and precise control of stability as well as viscosity and droplet size.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To preprel advanced anode materials involving alloy/de&#8208;alloy chemistry for potassium ion batteries (PIBs), two&#8208;dimensional (2D) bismuth subcarbonate (BCO) nanosheets that posses high theoretical capacity of 631 mAh g  &#8208;1  were firstly proposed. The large lattice spacing of 0.683 nm along b axis facilitate insertion of K  +  ion to boost high capacity delivery of ~610 mAh g  &#8208;1  , and the in&#8208;situ nano&#8208;crystalization well ease volume changes of the integrated particle and shorten ion diffusion path during potassiation/depotassiation. After coupling with a concentrated KFSI&#8208;G2 electrolyte, the robust and efficient SEI built from enhanced participation of FSI  &#8208;  synergistically endow structural stability of the flower&#8208;like BCO, and enable a prolonged cycling performance with capacity of ~300 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.2 A g  &#8208;1  for 1500 cycles, achieving an ultralow decay rate of 0.007%. Kinetic analysis of the hierarchical BCO demonstrate K  +  ion diffusion coefficient of ~10  &#8208;12  cm  2  s  &#8208;1  , and mechanism investigations via in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ XRD and Raman analysis probe the electrochemistry involving alloy/de&#8208;alloy and phase transition of the electrode, for which computation based on DFT further give evidence from the atomic/molecular level.

         <title>A Bimetallic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Encapsulated with DNAzyme for Intracellular Drug Synthesis and Self&#8208;Sufficient Gene Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although chemotherapy is one of the most widely used cancer treatments, some key issues remain elusive. For instance, most anticancer drugs exhibit serious side effects and chemotherapy alone&#160;may&#160;cause drug&#160;resistance, and the survived cancer cells may metastasize through the body. To address these problems, herein we designed and synthesized a bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) encapsulated with DNAzyme for co&#8208;triggered in situ cancer drug synthesis and DNAzyme&#8208;based gene therapy. Once entered into cancer cells, MOFs will disassemble and release copper ions, zinc ions, and DNAzyme under the acidic environment of lysosomes. On one hand, copper ions can catalyze the synthesis of the chemotherapeutic drug through the copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction after being reduced to Cu  I  . On the other hand, zinc ions act as the cofactor to activate the cleavage activity of DNAzyme. The anticancer drug is synthesized intracellularly, and can kill cancer cells on site to minimize side effects to normal organisms. At the same time, the activated DNAzyme works as a powerful tool for gene therapy to inhibit tumor proliferation and metastasis by targeting and cleaving oncogene substrates. Therefore, our bifunctional system provides a well controlled and synergistic way for better cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicolor Two&#8208;photon Nanosystem for Multiplexed Intracellular Imaging and Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The novel theranostic nanosystems based on two&#8208;photon fluorescence can achieve higher spatial resolution of deep tissue imaging for simultaneous diagnosis and therapy of a variety of cancers. Herein, we have designed and prepared FRET&#8208;based two&#8208;photon mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MTP&#8208;MSNs) for single&#8208;excitation multiplexed intracellular imaging and targeted cancer therapy for the first time. This nanosystem includes two constituents, containing (1) multicolor two&#8208;photon mesoporous silica nanoparticles and (2) cancer cell&#8208;targeting aptamers that act as gatekeepers for MTP&#8208;MSNs. After incubation with cancer cells, the Dox&#8208;loaded and aptamer&#8208;capped MTP&#8208;MSNs could be internalized into the cells, opening the pores and releasing the drug. Furthermore, using two&#8208;photon multicolor fluorescence, MTP&#8208;MSNs could serve as good contrast agents for multicolor two&#8208;photon intracellular imaging with increased imaging depth and improved spatial localization of tissue. In sum, these multicolor MTP&#8208;MSNs provide a novel system for traceable targeted cancer therapy with further applications in multiplex intracellular imaging and the screening of drug.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intriguing (&#956;&#8208;hydrido)diboranes(4) with their prominent pristine representative [B  2  H  5  ]  &#8210;  have mainly been studied theoretically. We now describe the behavior of the planarized tetraaryl (&#956;&#8208;hydrido)diborane(4) anion [  1  H]  &#8210;  in cycloaddition reactions with the homologous series of heterocumulenes CO  2  , i  PrNCO, and  i  PrNCN  i  Pr. We show that a C=O bond of CO  2  selectively activates the B&#8210;B bond of [  1  H]  &#8210;  , while the &#956;&#8208;H ligand is left untouched ([  2  H]  &#8210;  ). The carbodiimide  i  PrNCN  i  Pr, in contrast, neglects the B&#8210;B bond and rather adds the B&#8208;bonded H  &#8210;  ion to its central C atom to generate a formamidinate bridge across the B  2  pair ([  3  ]  &#8210;  ). As a hybrid, the isocyanate  i  PrNCO combines the reactivity patterns of both its congeners and gives two products: one of them ([  4  H]  &#8210;  ) is related to [  2  H]  &#8210;  , the other ([  5  ]  &#8210;  ) is an analog of [  3  ]  &#8210;  . We finally propose a mechanistic scenario, which rationalizes the individual reaction outcomes and combines them to a coherent picture of B&#8210;B&#8208; vs. B&#8210;H&#8208;bond activation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Covalent Black Phosphorus/Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Hetero&#8208;nanostructure for High&#8208;Performance Flexible Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop heterostructured black phosphorus/metal&#8211;organic framework hybrids by P&#8208;O&#8208;Co covalent bonding based on a droplet microfluidic strategy. The resulting hybrids are further constructed by 3D printing method into all&#8208;integrated solid&#8208;state flexible supercapacitor, which presents high energy density and capacitance owing to well&#8208;developed micro&#8208;porosity, large ionic surface area, and high redox activity.







Abstract
We develop hetero&#8208;nanostructured black phosphorus/metal&#8208;organic framework hybrids formed by P&#8208;O&#8208;Co covalent bonding based on a designed droplet microfluidic strategy consisting of confined and ultrafast microdroplet reactions. The resulting hybrid exhibits large capacitance (1347&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1) in KOH electrolytes due to its large specific&#8208;surface&#8208;area (632.47&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), well&#8208;developed micro&#8208;porosity (0.38&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1), and engineered electroactivity. Furthermore, the proposed 3D printing method allows to construct all&#8208;integrated solid&#8208;state supercapacitor, which maintains interconnected porous network, good interfacial adhesion, and robust flexibility for short&#8208;path diffusion and excessive accommodation of ions. Consequently, the fabricated flexible supercapacitor delivers ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 109.8&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3, large capacitance of 506&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3, and good long&#8208;term stability of 12000 cycles.

         <title>A Homage to Siegfried H&#252;nig and His Research</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not just H&#252;nig's base! Siegfried H&#252;nig's 100th birthday is a good time to recall the fundamental work of this versatile chemist. His group studied reactive intermediates, synthetic methods, and unique target compounds. The central leitmotif of his research was the synthesis and behavior of dyes, redox systems, and organic metals. H&#252;nig started his career during World War II and for 65&#8197;years he was a distinguished scientist and teacher.







Abstract
Examples from different research areas of Siegfried H&#252;nig are displayed to remind us that organic chemistry owes much more than H&#252;nig's base to this exceptionally versatile and creative chemist. The main research lines dealing with the synthesis and physical characterization of new dyes, multistage redox systems, and organic metals will be presented as well as his contributions to enamine chemistry, the discovery of diimine as a hydrogenation agent, and nucleophilic acylation with trimethylsilyl cyanide, which are less well&#8208;known nowadays. In addition, exotic compounds with parallel C=C and N=N bonds were systematically studied in H&#252;nig's group. Reflecting on the development of his research demonstrates both the importance of a systematic approach and how fruitful entirely unexpected results are if they meet a &#8220;well&#8208;prepared mind&#8221;. During H&#252;nig's academic career, teaching played an indisputable role. His efforts in modernizing the chemistry institute at W&#252;rzburg and his support of young researchers in the academic system in Germany are also highlighted.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Function Dataset Reveals Environment Effects within a Fluorescent Protein Model System**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic environments can drastically alter the spectroscopy and photochemistry of molecules. A large structural and spectroscopic dataset of closely&#8208;related protein variants is used to study how the anisotropic chromophore environment of a fluorescent protein determines its properties.







Abstract
Anisotropic environments can drastically alter the spectroscopy and photochemistry of molecules, leading to complex structure&#8208;function relationships. We examined this using fluorescent proteins as easy&#8208;to&#8208;modify model systems. Starting from a single scaffold, we have developed a range of 27 photochromic fluorescent proteins that cover a broad range of spectroscopic properties, including the determination of 43 crystal structures. Correlation and principal component analysis confirmed the complex relationship between structure and spectroscopy, but also allowed us to identify consistent trends and to relate these to the spatial organization. We find that changes in spectroscopic properties can come about through multiple underlying mechanisms, of which polarity, hydrogen bonding and presence of water molecules are key modulators. We anticipate that our findings and rich structure/spectroscopy dataset can open opportunities for the development and evaluation of new and existing protein engineering methods.

         <title>Spatio&#8208;Chemical Heterogeneity of Defect&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Crystals Revealed by Full&#8208;Field Tomographic X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;dimensional view of chemical heterogeneities in defect&#8208;engineered HKUST&#8208;1 metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) crystals is presented. Cryo&#8208;full&#8208;field XANES computed tomography was used to visualize the presence and distribution of a second coordination polymer of reduced copper coordination within defect&#8208;engineered HKUST&#8208;1 crystals. Observations encourage a revisitation of the structure&#8208;property relationships of defect&#8208;engineered MOFs.







Abstract
The introduction of structural defects in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), often achieved through the fractional use of defective linkers, is emerging as a means to refine the properties of existing MOFs. These linkers, missing coordination fragments, create unsaturated framework nodes that may alter the properties of the MOF. A property&#8208;targeted utilization of this approach demands an understanding of the structure of the defect&#8208;engineered MOF. We demonstrate that full&#8208;field X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure computed tomography can help to improve our understanding. This was demonstrated by visualizing the chemical heterogeneity found in defect&#8208;engineered HKUST&#8208;1 MOF crystals. A non&#8208;uniform incorporation and zonation of the defective linker was discovered, leading to the presence of clusters of a second coordination polymer within HKUST&#8208;1. The former is suggested to be responsible, in part, for altered MOF properties; thereby, advocating for a spatio&#8208;chemically resolved characterization of MOFs.

         <title>Delayed Linker Addition (DLA) Synthesis for Hybrid SOD ZIFs with&#8201;Unsubstituted Imidazolate Linkers for Propylene/Propane and n&#8208;Butane/i&#8208;Butane Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple one&#8208;pot synthesis, termed delayed linker addition (DLA), was developed to form hybrid ZIFs consisting of unsubstituted imidazolate and 2&#8208;methylimidazolate linkers with SOD topology. The easily obtained nuclei of ZIF&#8208;8 were utilized as a template to guide the structure of the crystals and to reduce the high energy required to form hybrid ZIFs.







Abstract
We present a novel synthesis strategy termed delayed linker addition (DLA) to synthesize hybrid zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate frameworks containing unsubstituted imidazolate linkers (Im) with SOD topology (hereafter termed Im/ZIF&#8208;8). Im linker incorporation can create larger voids and apertures, which are important properties for gas storage and separation. To date, there have been only a handful of reports of Im linkers incorporated into ZIF&#8208;8 frameworks, typically requiring arduous and complicated post synthesis approaches. DLA, as reported here, is a simple one&#8208;step synthesis strategy allowing high incorporation of Im linker into the ZIF&#8208;8 framework while still retaining its SOD topology. We fabricated mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) with 6FDA&#8208;DAM polymer and Im/ZIF&#8208;8 obtained via DLA as a filler. The Im/ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;containing MMMs showed excellent performance for both propylene/propane and n&#8208;butane/i&#8208;butane separation, displaying permeability and ideal selectivity well above the polymer upper bound. Moreover, highly detailed molecular simulations shed light to the aperture size and flexibility response of Im/ZIF&#8208;8 and its improved diffusivity as compared to ZIF&#8208;8.

         <title>Stimulation of Redox&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer by Interligand Hydrogen Bonding in a Cobalt Complex with Redox&#8208;Active Guanidine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strengthening of interligand hydrogen bonding triggers a redox&#8208;induced intramolecular electron transfer (RIET) upon oxidation of a CoIII complex with a neutral redox&#8208;active bisguanidine ligand, leading to metal reduction (CoIII&#8594;CoII) and two&#8208;electron oxidation of the bisguanidine ligand. In the absence of interligand hydrogen bonding, oxidation leads to a CoIII complex with a radical monocationic guanidine ligand.







Abstract
Octahedrally coordinated cobalt(II) complexes with a redox&#8208;active bisguanidine ligand and acac co&#8208;ligands were synthesized and their redox chemistry analysed in detail. The N&#8722;H functions in a bisguanidine ligand with partially alkylated guanidino groups form N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonds with the acac co&#8208;ligands, thereby massively influencing the redox chemistry. For all complexes, the first one&#8208;electron oxidation is metal&#8208;centred, leading to CoIII complexes with neutral bisguanidine ligand units. Further one&#8208;electron oxidation is ligand&#8208;centred in the case of Co&#8211;bisguanidine complexes with fully alkylated guanidino groups, giving CoIII complexes with radical monocationic bisguanidine ligands. On the other hand, the hydrogen&#8208;bond strengthening upon oxidation of the Co&#8211;bisguanidine complex with partially alkylated guanidino groups initiates metal reduction (CoIII&#8594;CoII) and two&#8208;electron oxidation of the guanidine ligand, providing the first example for the stimulation of redox&#8208;induced electron transfer by interligand hydrogen bonding.

         <title>Direct Access to Primary Amines from Alkenes by Selective Metal&#8208;Free Hydroamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and modular route to a wide variety of aliphatic primary amines from alkenes is presented based on a metal&#8208;free hydroamination at room temperature. The use of cost&#8208;effective and easily available ammonium carbonate allows for the efficient conversion of terminal and internal alkenes with diverse substitution patterns into highly functionalized linear, &#945;&#8208;branched, and &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines.







Abstract
Direct and selective synthesis of primary amines from easily available precursors is attractive yet challenging. Herein, we report the rapid synthesis of primary amines from alkenes via metal&#8208;free regioselective hydroamination at room temperature. Ammonium carbonate was used as ammonia surrogate for the first time, allowing for efficient conversion of terminal and internal alkenes into linear, &#945;&#8208;branched, and &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines under mild conditions. This method provides a straightforward and powerful approach to a wide spectrum of advanced, highly functionalized primary amines which are of particular interest in pharmaceutical chemistry and other areas.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Gated Photochemical Synthesis of Phenalene Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylisophthalaldehydes form two highly reactive ortho&#8208;quinodimethane dienophiles in a step&#8208;wise and wavelength gated fashion. Trapping with maleimides proceeds with high stereoselectivity under the formation of phenalene diimide scaffolds. Subsequent elimination and oxidation affords a new class of persistent phenalenyl diimide neutral radicals.







Abstract
Herein, we pioneer a wavelength&#8208;gated synthesis route to phenalene diimides. Consecutive Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of methylisophthalaldehydes and maleimides afford hexahydro&#8208;phenalene&#8208;1,6&#8208;diol diimides via 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;benzo[f]isoindoles as the intermediate. Both photoreactions are efficient (82&#8211;99&#8201;% yield) and exhibit excellent diastereoselectivity (62&#8211;98&#8201;%&#8197;d.r.). The wavelength&#8208;gated nature of the stepwise reaction enables the modular construction of phenalene diimide scaffolds by choice of substrate and wavelength. Importantly, this synthetic methodology opens a facile avenue to a new class of persistent phenalenyl diimide neutral radicals, constituting a versatile route to spin&#8208;active molecules.

         <title>Polyhedral Oligosilsesquioxanes in Functional Chiral Nanoassemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating polyhedral oligosilsesquioxanes into functional chiral nanoassemblies enables flexible control over chiroptical properties and supramolecular chirality. The chiral nanoassemblies were also used for instant information encryption and storage with multiple luminescent displays.







Abstract
Incorporation of giant molecular nanoparticles with atomic precision into chiral nanoassemblies facilitates the fabrication of functional ordered phases with supramolecular chirality, which remains mysterious. Reported here is the first example of polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane (POSS) derivatives that self&#8208;assemble into well&#8208;defined chiral nanoassemblies. POSSs were covalently conjugated to N&#8208;terminal aromatic amino acids, which self&#8208;assembled into nanohelices and twists with explicit handedness tuned by solvent polarity. Chiral nanoassemblies showed active chiroptical responses including Cotton effects and circularly polarized luminescence. The chiral systems can bind guest molecules by charge&#8208;transfer interactions, whereby self&#8208;assembled structures, chiroptical activities, and luminescent colors were further modulated. The unique coassembly systems were applied for instant information encryption and storage with multiple luminescent displays. This work offers a new protocol for the design of functional chiral materials of POSS by molecular self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Concise Asymmetric Syntheses of Streptazone&#8197;A and Abikoviromycin**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise route to deliver [4.3.0] alkaloid natural products featuring an allene&#8208;ynamide Pauson&#8211;Khand cyclization, an asymmetric and highly regioselective epoxidation and a chemoselective iridium&#8208;catalyzed reduction is presented. The route delivers streptazone&#8197;B1, streptazone&#8197;A and abikoviromycin for the first time, and lastly demonstrates an idiosyncratic thiol reactivity characteristic for streptazone&#8197;A.







Abstract
Streptazone&#8197;A and abikoviromycin are alkaloids that both feature an unusual arrangement of reactive functionalities within a compact tricyclic ring system. Here, we report a highly concise asymmetric synthesis of both natural products. The route first constructs another family member, streptazone&#8197;B1, using a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed distal selective allene&#8208;ynamide Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction. A regio&#8208; and enantioselective epoxidation under chiral phase&#8208;transfer catalytic conditions directly afforded streptazone&#8197;A in 8&#8197;steps overall. In one additional step, a chemoselective, iridium&#8208;catalyzed reduction of the enaminone system then gave abikoviromycin. The reactivity of streptazone&#8197;A towards a cysteine mimic, N&#8208;acetylcysteamine, was studied and revealed unanticipated transformations, including bis&#8208;thiol conjugation which may proceed via formation of a cyclopentadienone intermediate. With flexible access to these compounds, studies aimed to identify their direct biological targets are now possible.

         <title>Amino Acid&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Asymmetric Base&#8211;Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy comprising of the grafting of amino acids onto porous MOFs followed by metalation with earth&#8208;abundant metals, such as iron, affords heterogeneous single&#8208;site chiral catalysts by site isolation. The iron catalysts displayed high activity and excellent enantioselectivity in hydrosilylation and hydroboration of carbonyls.







Abstract
We report a strategy to develop heterogeneous single&#8208;site enantioselective catalysts based on naturally occurring amino acids and earth&#8208;abundant metals for eco&#8208;friendly asymmetric catalysis. The grafting of amino acids within the pores of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), followed by post&#8208;synthetic metalation with iron precursor, affords highly active and enantioselective (&gt;99&#8201;% ee for 10 examples) catalysts for hydrosilylation and hydroboration of carbonyl compounds. Impressively, the MOF&#8208;Fe catalyst displayed high turnover numbers of up to 10&#8201;000 and was recycled and reused more than 15 times without diminishing the enantioselectivity. MOF&#8208;Fe displayed much higher activity and enantioselectivity than its homogeneous control catalyst, likely due to the formation of robust single&#8208;site catalyst in the MOF through site&#8208;isolation.

         <title>The Competitive Aggregation Pathway of an Asymmetric Chiral Oligo(p&#8208;phenyleneethynylene) Towards the Formation of Individual P and M Supramolecular Helical Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregation of a short, chiral, and asymmetric oligo(phenyleneethynylene) [OPE, (S)&#8208;1] goes through a competitive pathway in which the two diastereomeric P and M supramolecular helices can be selectively produced by choosing the correct experimental conditions. Thus, while an M supramolecular aggregate is obtained in MCH/DCM [AggII], the diastereomeric P aggregate [AggI] is produced by adding toluene to the solvent mixture MCH/Tol/DCM.







Abstract
A complex aggregation pathway towards two diastereomeric P and M supramolecular helices arises from the aggregation of a short, chiral, and rigid oligo(phenyleneethynylene) [OPE, (S)&#8208;1]. Thus, while AggI aggregate is obtained when a DCM solution of (S)&#8208;1 is diluted with MCH at room temperature, AggII aggregate is generated only after a slow heating (353&#8197;K)/cooling (273&#8197;K) process. Interestingly, during AggI formation (mechanism 1), short P chain oligomers are produced, which have a great tendency to aggregate in plane, yielding brick&#8208;like nanostructures that halt the aggregation process. On the other hand, after a heating/cooling cycle, long M type columnar helical aggregates (AggII) are obtained, formed by individual supramolecular polymer chains (mechanism 2) easily visualized by AFM. The two different P/M orientations obtained for AggI and AggII reveal the dynamic character of the system and its ability to create diastereomeric helical structures under the right conditions. Different experimental protocols were explored to prepare long M type columnar helical aggregates, which are not obtained by using the previous MCH/DCM 99/1 (v/v) solvent mixture. The generation of the desired M oriented supramolecular polymer is achieved when toluene is added to the solvent mixture in a 97/2/1 MCH/Tol/DCM (v/v/v) ratio.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclic Nitrones by Chemoselective Intramolecular Allylic Alkylation of Oximes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iridium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular chemo&#8208; and enantioselective N&#8208;allylation of oximes is reported. The method employs E/Z&#8197;mixtures of oximes and furnishes cyclic nitrones with high enantioselectivity. Tandem N&#8208;allylation/dipolar cycloaddition sequences provide access to enantioenriched tricyclic isoxazolidines and enable the formal synthesis of the marine natural product Halichlorine.







Abstract
The enantio&#8208; and chemoselective iridium&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;allylation of oximes is described for the first time. Intramolecular kinetic resolution provides access to cyclic nitrones and enantioenriched aliphatic allylic alcohols. Salient features of this transformation are its ability to employ E/Z&#8208;isomeric mixtures of oxime starting materials convergently and high functional group tolerance. The implementation of N&#8208;allylation/1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction sequences furnishes tricyclic isoxazolidines in highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective fashion. The synthetic utility of the approach is demonstrated by the efficient, formal synthesis of the marine natural product (+)&#8208;halichlorine.

         <title>Formate Dehydrogenases Reduce CO2 Rather than HCO3&#8722;: An&#8201;Electrochemical Demonstration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, inexpensive and fast method based on protein film electrochemistry is proposed to discriminate whether CO2 or HCO3&#8722; is the substrate of any catalyst interacting with an electrode. In this study, CO2 rather than HCO3&#8722; is found to be the substrate of both formate dehydrogenase and CO dehydrogenase.







Abstract
Mo/W formate dehydrogenases catalyze the reversible reduction of CO2 species to formate. It is thought that the substrate is CO2 and not a hydrated species like HCO3&#8722;, but there is still no indisputable evidence for this, in spite of the extreme importance of the nature of the substrate for mechanistic studies. We devised a simple electrochemical method to definitively demonstrate that the substrate of formate dehydrogenases is indeed CO2.

         <title>Crown Ether Functionalized Potassium&#8208;Responsive Anionocages for Cascaded Guest Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium&#8208;responsive anionocages were developed for cascaded guest delivery in a reversible manner. Binding of K+ by a crown ether functionalized, heteroleptic anionocage triggers the release and delivery of a TEA+ (tetraethylammonium) guest to another anionocage that is a weaker and less K+&#8208;sensitive receptor, which process could be fully reversed by elimination of the K+ with [2,2,2]&#8208;cryptand.







Abstract
In many critical biological processes, host&#8211;guest chemistry of protein receptors is regulated by effector molecules to realize cascaded delivery of messenger molecules between different targets. Mimicking these natural processes with artificial receptors remains a challenge. Herein, we report a cascaded guest delivery between two anionocages (anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven cages), in a reversible manner, wherein binding of K+ ions by a crown ether functionalized, heteroleptic A2L3 (A=anion, L=ligand) anionocage triggers the release and delivery of a TEA+ (tetraethylammonium) guest to another A2L3 anionocage that is a weaker and less K+&#8208;sensitive receptor. Elimination of the K+ with [2,2,2]&#8208;cryptand enables recapture of the TEA+ by the crown ether functionalized anionocage and thus realizes a reversed guest delivery. Moreover, integrative self&#8208;sorting of anionocages is firstly reported, leading to heteroleptic cages with enhanced guest binding affinities.

         <title>Diverse Synthesis of Chiral Trifluoromethylated Alkanes via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling Fluoroalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We described a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric trifluoroalkylation of aryl iodes, by demonstrating the first example of enantioselective reductive cross&#8208;coupling fluoroalkylation with high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional group tolerance, especially for diverse pharmaceutical and bioactive complex molecules. This strategy provided an efficient and facile way for diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of chiral trifluoromethylated alkanes.







Abstract
The trifluoromethyl group represents one of the most functional and widely used fluoroalkyl groups in drug design and screening, while the drug candidates containing chiral trifluoromethyl&#8208;bearing carbons are still few due to the lack of efficient methods for the asymmetric introduction of trifluoromethyl group into organic molecules. Herein, we described a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric trifluoroalkylation of aryl iodides, for the first time, by utilizing reductive cross&#8208;coupling in enantioselective fluoroalkylation. This novel method has demonstrated high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional group tolerance, especially for substrates containing diverse pharmaceutical and bioactive molecules moieties. This strategy provided an efficient and facile way for diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of chiral trifluoromethylated alkanes.

         <title>Promoting the Furan Ring&#8208;Opening Reaction to Access New Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts with Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) leads to a streamlined synthetic access to donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA) photoswitches through shortened reaction times and increased yields. This approach enables the diversification of DASA structures through the use of previously unreactive donor or acceptor groups, as well as simple access to DASA&#8211;polymer conjugates even when using electron&#8208;poor amine donors.







Abstract
Donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) are visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photoswitches with a variety of emerging applications in photoresponsive materials. Their two&#8208;step modular synthesis, centered on the nucleophilic ring opening of an activated furan, makes DASAs readily accessible. However, the use of less reactive donors or acceptors renders the process slow and low yielding, which has limited their development. We demonstrate here that 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) promotes the ring&#8208;opening reaction and stabilizes the open isomer, allowing greatly reduced reaction times and increased yields for known derivatives. In addition, it provides access to previously unattainable DASA&#8208;based photoswitches and DASA&#8211;polymer conjugates. The role of HFIP and the photochromic properties of a set of new DASAs is probed using a combination of 1H&#8197;NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. The use of sterically hindered, electron&#8208;poor amines enabled the dark equilibrium to be decoupled from closed&#8208;isomer half&#8208;lives for the first time.

         <title>Allostery&#8208;Mimicking Self&#8208;assembly of Helical Poly(phenylacetylene) Block Copolymers and the Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The poly(phenylacetylene)s block copolymers PPA&#8208;b&#8208;PsmNap with the dynamic helical backbone were synthesized to mimic the allosterical nature of proteins. The copolymers can sequentially evolve from vesicles to nanobelts to helical strands during the process of conformation transformation.







Abstract
Allostery can regulate protein self&#8208;assembly which further affects biological activities, and achieving precise control over the chiral suprastructures during self&#8208;assembly remains challenging. Herein, to mimic the allosterical nature of proteins, the poly(phenylacetylene) block copolymers PPA&#8208;b&#8208;PsmNap with the dynamic helical backbone were synthesized to investigate their conformational&#8208;transition&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. As the helical conformation of the block PsmNap spontaneously transforms from cis&#8208;transiod to cis&#8208;cisoid, the decreasing solubility of PsmNap blocks in THF induced self&#8208;assembly of PPA&#8208;b&#8208;PsmNap. The self&#8208;assembly structures of copolymers can sequentially evolve from vesicles to nanobelts to helical strands during the process of conformation transformation. The screw sense of final helical strands was strictly correlated to the helicity of the block PsmNap. This is helpful to understand the mechanism of allostery&#8208;modulated self&#8208;assembly.

&lt;p&gt;The poly(phenylacetylene)s block copolymers PPA&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;PsmNap with the dynamic helical backbone were synthesized to mimic the allosterical nature of proteins. The copolymers can sequentially evolve from vesicles to nanobelts to helical strands during the process of conformation transformation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allostery can regulate protein self&#8208;assembly which further affects biological activities, and achieving precise control over the chiral suprastructures during self&#8208;assembly remains challenging. Herein, to mimic the allosterical nature of proteins, the poly(phenylacetylene) block copolymers PPA&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;PsmNap with the dynamic helical backbone were synthesized to investigate their conformational&#8208;transition&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. As the helical conformation of the block PsmNap spontaneously transforms from &lt;i&gt;cis&#8208;transiod&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;cis&#8208;cisoid&lt;/i&gt;, the decreasing solubility of PsmNap blocks in THF induced self&#8208;assembly of PPA&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;PsmNap. The self&#8208;assembly structures of copolymers can sequentially evolve from vesicles to nanobelts to helical strands during the process of conformation transformation. The screw sense of final helical strands was strictly correlated to the helicity of the block PsmNap. This is helpful to understand the mechanism of allostery&#8208;modulated self&#8208;assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A General Strategy for the Construction of Calyciphylline&#8197;A&#8208;Type Alkaloids: Divergent Total Syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;Daphenylline and (&#8722;)&#8208;Himalensine&#8197;A</title>

         <dc:description>
The concise total syntheses of Daphniphyllum alkaloids (&#8722;)&#8208;daphenylline and (&#8722;)&#8208;himalensine&#8197;A have been accomplished in 16 and 19 steps, respectively, via an efficient formal two&#8208;step [4+3] cyclization strategy.







Abstract
An efficient general strategy for the synthesis of the Daphniphyllum alkaloids via the rapid construction of a common core intermediate has been established, based on which a divergent total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;daphenylline and (&#8722;)&#8208;himalensine&#8197;A has been accomplished in 16 and 19 steps, respectively. The present work features an enantioselective Mg(ClO4)2&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular amidocyclization to construct the aza&#8208;bridged core structure; a Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclopropanation and subsequent phosphine&#8208;catalyzed Cope&#8208;type rearrangement to furnish the himalensine&#8197;A scaffold; and a one&#8208;pot Diels&#8211;Alder/aromatization method to assemble the aromatic skeleton of daphenylline.

         <title>Pivotal role of hot&#8208;carriers in plasmonic catalysis of C&#8208;N bond forming reaction of amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong light&#8208;matter interaction driven chemical transformations on plasmonic metal nanostructures offers selective reaction pathways that cannot be accessed in temperature&#8208;driven catalysis. Utilization of the nonequilibrium energetic carriers, generated by the optical excitation of plasmon&#8208;supporting metal nanostructures, is the key to activate adsorbates and trigger chemical reactions. Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous utilization of both the hot carriers (electrons and holes) in the photocatalytic transformation of benzylamine to N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine and the scope of reaction has also been successfully demonstrated with catalytic oxidation of 4&#8208; methoxybenzylamine. The wavelength&#8208;dependent excitation of Au nanoparticle allows us to tune the potential energy of charge carriers relative to the redox potential of the reactants which leads to energetically favourable product formation on the nanoparticle surface. We capture the formation of reaction intermediates and products by using in situ Raman spectroscopy, complemented by NMR spectroscopy and GC&#8208;MS. Based on the experimental substantiations, a plausible reaction mechanism has been proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly &#947;&#8208;Selective Arylation and Carbonylative Arylation&#160;of 3&#8208;Bromo&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluoropropene via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nickel&#8208;catalyzed highly &#947;&#8208;regioselective arylation and carbonylative arylation of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluoropropene has been developed. The reaction proceeds under mild reaction conditions, providing the gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes with high efficiency and good functional group tolerance. The resulting gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes can serve as versatile building blocks for diversified synthesis. Preliminary mechanistic studies and density functional theory calculations reveal that both non&#8208;radical and radical pathways are possible for the reaction, and the radical pathway is more likely. The high &#947;&#8208;regioselectivity results from the &#946;&#8208;bromide elimination of alkylnickel(II) species or from the reductive&#8208;elimination of nickel(III) species [(aryl)(CF2=CHCH2)NiIII(Ln)X]. The &#947;&#8208;selective carbonylation of BDFP reaction under 1 atm CO gas also provides a new way for nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>130 years after Mond discovered the first homoleptic carbonyl complex Ni(CO)4, we report on a [Ni(CO)4]&#8729;+ salt as the first synthesis of any homoleptic nickel carbonyl cation in the condensed phase. It was prepared by oxidation of nickel metal with the synergistic oxidant Ag[F{Al(ORF)3}2] / 0.5&#160;I2 (RF = C(CF3)3) in CO atmosphere. This D2d&#8208;symmetric metalloradical represents the last missing entry among the structurally characterized homoleptic carbonyl cations of group 6 to 11. Additionally, the nickel tricarbonyl&#8208;nitrosyl cation [Ni(CO)3(NO)]+ was obtained by usage of NO[F{Al(ORF)3}2] and all pro&#173;ducts were fully characterized by means of IR, Raman, NMR/EPR, single crystal and powder XRD.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymorphism and fast Potassium&#8208;Ion Conduction in the T5 Supertetrahedral Phosphidosilicate KSi2P3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (ASSB) is a promising candidate for electrochemical energy storage. In view of the limited availability of lithium, however, alternative systems based on earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive elements are urgently sought. Besides the well&#8208;studied sodium&#8208;based systems, potassium&#8208;based systems offer the advan&#173;tage of low cost and a large electrochemical window but are hardly explored. Here we report on the synthesis and crystal structure of K&#8208;ion conducting T5 KSi  2  P  3  , which was inspired by recent discoveries of fast ion conductors in the family of alkali phosphidosilicates. KSi  2  P  3  is composed of SiP  4  tetrahedra forming interpenetrating networks of large T5 supertetrahedra. The compound passes through a reconstructive phase transition from the known T3 to the new tetragonal T5 polymorph at 1020 &#176;C with enantiotropic displacive phase transitions upon cooling at about 155 &#176;C and 80 &#176;C. The potassium ions are located in large channels between the T5 supertetrahedral networks and show facile movement through the structure. The bulk ionic conductivity can be as high as 2.6&#183;10  &#8208;4  S/cm at 25 &#176;C with an average activation energy of 0.20 eV. This is remarkable high for a potassium ion conductor at room temperature, and marks KSi  2  P  3  as the first non&#8208;oxide solid potassium ion conductor.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Practical Separation of Cyclic and Linear Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The purification step in the manufacturing of cyclic polymers is difficult as complete fractionation to eliminate linear impurities requires considerable effort. Here, we report a new polymer separation methodology that uses metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to discriminate between linear and cyclic polyethylene glycols (PEGs) via selective polymer insertion into the MOF nanopores. Preparation of a MOF&#8208;packed column allowed analytical and preparative chromatographic separation of these topologically distinct pairs. In addition, gram&#8208;scale PEGs with only cyclic structures were successfully obtained from a crude reaction mixture by using MOF as an adsorbent.</dc:description>

In addition, gram&#8208;scale PEGs with only cyclic structures were successfully obtained from a crude reaction mixture by using MOF as an adsorbent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Collective Asymmetric Total Synthesis of C&#8208;11 Oxygenated Cephalotaxus Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While numerous studies pertaining to the total synthesis of  Cephalotaxus  alkaloids have been reported, only two strategies have been reported to date for the successful synthesis of the C&#8208;11 oxygenated subset, due to the additional synthetic challenge posed by the remote C&#8208;11 stereocenter. Herein, we report the collective asymmetric total synthesis of C&#8208;11 oxygenated  Cephalotaxus  alkaloids using a chiral proline both as a starting material and as the only chirality source. A tetracyclic advanced intermediate was synthesized in a highly stereoselective manner from  l  &#8208;proline in 8 steps involving sequential chirality transfer steps such as a diastereoselective  N  &#8208;alkylation, stereospecific Stevens rearrangement and intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction via an unusual  O  &#8208;acyloxocarbenium intermediate. From a common intermediate, the asymmetric total synthesis of six C&#8208;11 oxygenated  Cephalotaxus  alkaloids was completed by a series of oxidation state adjustments.</dc:description>

         <title>Antiprotozoal structure&#8208;activity relationships of synthetic leucinostatin derivatives and elucidation of their mode of action</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Leucinostatin A is one of the most potent antiprotozoal compounds ever described, but little was known on structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR). We used  Trypanosoma brucei  as a protozoal model organism to test synthetically modified derivatives, resulting in simplified but equally active compounds  2  (ZHAWOC6025) and  4  (ZHAWOC6027), which were subsequently modified in all regions of the molecule to gain an in&#8208;depth SAR understanding. The antiprotozoal SAR matched SAR in phospholipid liposomes, where membrane integrity, leaking, and dynamics were studied. The mode of action is discussed based on a structure&#8208;activity analysis of derivatives in efficacy, ultrastructural studies in  T. brucei  , and artificial membrane models, mimicking membrane stability and membrane potential. The main site of antiprotozoal action of natural and synthetic leucinostatins lies in the destabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane, as demonstrated by ultrastructural analysis, electron microscopy and mitochondrial staining. Long&#8208;time sublethal exposure of  T. brucei  (200 passages) and siRNA screening of 12000 mutants showed no signs of resistance development to the synthetic derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Ratiometric NADH Sensing Using Semiconducting Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) is a key coenzyme in living cells due to its role as an electron carrier&#160;in redox reactions, and its concentration is an important indicator of cell metabolic state. Abnormal NADH levels are associated with age&#8208;related metabolic diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, creating a demand for a simple, rapid analytical method for point&#8208;of&#8208;care NADH sensing. Here we develop a series of NADH&#8208;sensitive semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) as nanoprobes for NADH measurement, and test their performance in vitro and in vivo. NADH sensing is based on electron transfer from semiconducting polymer chains in the Pdot to NADH upon UV excitation, quenching Pdot fluorescence emission. In polyfluorene&#8208;based Pdots, this mechanism resulted in an on&#8208;off NADH sensor; in DPA&#8208;CNPPV Pdots, UV excitation resulted in NADH&#8208;sensitive emission at two wavelengths, enabling ratiometric detection. Ratiometric NADH detection using DPA&#8208;CNPPV Pdots exhibits high sensitivity (3.1 &#956;M limit of detection), excellent selectivity versus other analytes, reversibility, and a fast response (less than 5 s). We demonstrate applications of the ratiometric NADH&#8208;sensing Pdots including smartphone&#8208;based NADH imaging for point&#8208;of&#8208;care use.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligonucleotide Bioconjugation with Bifunctional Palladium Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organometallic reagents enable practical strategies for bioconjugation. Innovations in the design of water&#8208;soluble ligands and the enhancement of reaction rates have allowed for chemoselective cross&#8208;coupling reactions of peptides and proteins to be carried out in water. There are currently no organometallic&#8208;based methods for oligonucleotide bioconjugation to other biomolecules. Here we report bifunctional palladium(II)&#8208;oxidative addition complexes (OACs) as reagents for high&#8208;yielding oligonucleotide bioconjugation reactions. These bifunctional OACs react chemoselectively with amine&#8208;modified oligonucleotides to generate the first isolable, bench stable oligonucleotide&#8208;palladium(II) OACs. These complexes undergo site&#8208;selective C&#8208;S arylation with a broad range of native thiol&#8208;containing biomolecules at low micromolar concentrations in under one hour. This approach provided oligonucleotide&#8208;peptide, oligonucleotide&#8208;protein, oligonucleotide&#8208;small molecule, and oligonucleotide&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates in &gt;80% yield and afforded conjugation of multiple copies of oligonucleotides onto a monoclonal antibody.</dc:description>

         <title>Defect Passivation in Lead&#8208;Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals and Thin Films: Toward Efficient LEDs and Solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead&#8208;halide perovskites (LHPs), in the form of both colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) and thin films, have emerged over the past decade as leading candidates for next&#8208;generation, efficient light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and solar cells. Owing to their high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), LHPs efficiently convert injected charge&#8208;carriers to light and  vice versa  . However, despite the defect&#8208;tolerance of LHPs, defects at the surface of colloidal NCs and at grain boundaries in thin films play a critical role in charge&#8208;carrier transport and non&#8208;radiative recombination, which lowers PLQYs, device efficiency and stability. Therefore, understanding the defects that play a key role in limiting performance, and developing effective passivation routes is critical for achieving advances in performance, and therefore features at the forefront of perovskite research. This review presents the current understanding of the defects in perovskites (both colloidal NCs and thin films) and their influence on the optical and charge&#8208;carrier transport properties. The review also discusses the passivation strategies toward improving the efficiencies of perovskite&#8208;based LEDs and solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Lignin Compounds to Monoaromatics: Selective Cleavage of C&#8208;O Bonds over Brominated Ruthenium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cleavage of C&#8208;O linkages in aryl ethers in biomass&#8208;derived lignin compounds without hydrogenation of the aromatic rings is a major challenge for the production of sustainable mono&#8208;aromatics. Conventional strategies over the heterogeneous metal catalysts require the addition of homogeneous base additives causing environmental problems. Herein, we propose a heterogeneous Ru/C catalyst modified by Br atoms for the selective direct cleavage of C&#8208;O bonds in diphenyl ether without hydrogenation of aromatic rings reaching the yield of benzene and phenol as high as 90.3 % and increased selectivity to mono&#8208;aromatics (97.3 vs 46.2 % for initial Ru) during depolymerization of lignin. Characterization of the catalyst indicates selective poisoning by Br of terrace sites over Ru nanoparticles, which are active in the hydrogenation of aromatic rings, while  the defect sites on the edges and corners remain available and provide higher  intrinsic activity in the C&#8208;O bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Mode&#8208;Specific Vibrational Analysis of Exciton Delocalization and Structural Dynamics in Conjugated Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exciton delocalization in organic semiconducting polymers, affected by structures at a molecular level, plays a crucial role in modulating relaxation pathways, such as charge generation and singlet fission, which can boost the device efficiency. However, structural diversity of polymers and broad signals from typical electronic spectroscopy have had limits to reveal the interplay between local structures and exciton delocalization. To tackle these problems, here, we apply femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy in archetypical conjugated oligothiophenes with different chain lengths. We observed Raman frequency dispersions of symmetric bond stretching modes and mode&#8208;specific kinetics in the S  1  Raman spectra, which underpins the subtle and complex interplay between exciton delocalization and bond length alternation along the conjugation coordinate. Our results provide a more general picture of exciton delocalization in the context of molecular structures for conjugated materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;Ketoacylsilanes with Imines: Facile Access to &#946;&#8208;Lactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of  &#946;  &#8208;lactams from  &#945;&#8208;  ketoacylsilanes and imines, which proceeds via a formal [2+2] photochemical cycloaddition with in situ generation of siloxyketene. This mild and operationally simple reaction proceeds in an atom&#8208;economic fashion with broad substrate scope, including aldimines, ketimines, hydrazones, and fused nitrogen heterocycles, affording a variety of important  &#946;  &#8208;lactams with satisfactory diastereoselectivities in most cases. This reaction also features good functional&#8208;group tolerance, facile scalability and product diversification. Experimental and computational studies suggest that  &#945;  &#8208;ketoacylsilanes can serve as photochemical precursors by engaging in a 1,3 silicon shift to the distal carbonyl group.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Dynamic Metal&#8208;Polymer Interaction to Improve Catalyst Selectivity and Longevity in Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling metal&#8208;support interactions is important for tuning the catalytic properties of supported metal catalysts. Here, premade Pd particles are supported on stable polymers containing different ligating functionalities to control the metal&#8208;polymer interactions and their catalytic properties in industrially relevant acetylene partial hydrogenation. The polymers containing strongly ligating groups (e.g., Ar&#8208;SH and Ar&#8208;S&#8208;Ar) can form a polymer overlayer on the Pd surface, which enables selective acetylene adsorption and partial hydrogenation to ethylene without deactivation. In contrast, polymers with weakly ligating groups (e.g., Ar&#8208;O&#8208;Ar) do not form an overlayer, resulting in non&#8208;selective hydrogenation and fast deactivation, similar to Pd catalysts on conventional inorganic supports. The results imply that tuning the metal&#8208;polymer interactions via rational polymer design can provide an efficient way of synthesizing selective and stable catalysts for hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting reaction&#8208;diffusion conditions to trigger pathway complexity in the growth of a MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymers (CPs), including metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), are crystalline materials with promising applications in electronics, magnetism, catalysis, and gas storage/separation. However, the mechanisms and pathways underlying their formation remain largely undisclosed. Herein, we demonstrate that diffusion&#8208;controlled mixing of reagents at the very early stages of the crystallization process (i.e., within &#8275;40 ms), achieved by using continuous&#8208;flow microfluidic devices, can be used to enable novel crystallization pathways of a prototypical spin&#8208;crossover MOF towards its thermodynamic product. In particular, two distinct and unprecedented nucleation&#8208;growth pathways were experimentally observed when crystallization was triggered under microfluidic mixing. Full&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations also confirm the occurrence of these two distinct pathways during crystal growth. In sharp contrast, a crystallization by particle attachment was observed under bulk (turbulent) mixing. These unprecedented results provide a sound basis for understanding the growth of CPs and open up new avenues for the engineering of porous materials by using out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Supramolecular coordination cages show a wide range of useful properties including, but not limited to, complex molecular machine&#8208;like operations, confined space catalysis, and rich host&#8208;guest chemistries. Here we report the uptake and release of non&#8208;covalently encapsulated, pharmaceutically&#8208;active cargo from an octahedral Pd cage bearing polymer chains on each vertex. Six poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;decorated bipyridine ligands are used to assemble an octahedral PdII6(TPT)4 cage. The supramolecular container encapsulates progesterone and ibuprofen within its hydrophobic nanocavity and is activated by shear force produced by ultrasonication in aqueous solution entailing complete cargo release upon rupture, as shown by NMR and GPC analyses</dc:description>

         <title>The Metallocene Battery &#8208; Ultrafast Electron Transfer Self Exchange Rate Accompanied by a Harmonic Height Breathing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first all&#8208;metallocene rechargeable battery consisting of poly&#8208;cobaltocenium/&#8208; and poly&#8208;ferrocene/reduced graphene oxide composites as anode and cathode was prepared. The intrinsically fast ET self&#8208;exchange rate of metallocenes was successfully combined with an efficient ion&#8208;percolation achieved by molecular self&#8208;assembly. The resulting battery materials show ideal Nernstian behavior, is thickness scalable up to &gt; 1.2 C cm  &#8208;2  , and exhibit high coulombic efficiency at ultrafast rates (200 A g  &#8208;1  ). Using aqueous LiClO  4  , the charge is carried exclusively by the anion. The ClO  4  &#8208;  intercalation is accompanied by a reciprocal height change of the active layers. Principally, volume changes in organic battery materials during charging/discharging are not desirable and represent a major safety issue. However, here, the individual height changes &#8208; due to ion breathing &#8208; are reciprocal and thus prohibiting any internal pressure build&#8208;up in the closed&#8208;cell, leading to excellent cycling stability.</dc:description>

         <title>The electrophilicity of surface carbon species in the redox of CuO&#8208;CeO2 catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI) describes the electron flow between metal sites and a metal oxide support. It is generally used to follow the mechanism of redox reactions. In the study of CuO&#8208;CeO2  redox, an additional flow of electron from metallic Cu to surface carbon species is observed  via  a combination of  operando  X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, near ambient pressure&#8208;near edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. An electronic metal&#8208;support&#8208;carbon interaction (EMSCI) is proposed to explain the reaction pathway of CO oxidation. The EMSCI provides a complete picture of the mass and electron flow, which will help predict and improve the catalytic performance in the selective activation of CO2  , carbonate or carbonyl species in C1 chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polybenzimidazoles are engineering plastics with superb thermal stability and this specificity sparks a wide&#8208;range research to explore proton conducting materials. Nevertheless, they encounter challenging issues owing to phosphoric acid proton carrier leakage and slow proton transport. Here we report a strategy for designing porous polybenzimidazole frameworks to address these key fundamental issues. The built&#8208;in channels are designed to be one&#8208;dimensionally extended, unidirectionally aligned, and fully occupied by neat phosphoric acid, while the benzimidazole walls trigger multipoint, multichain, and multitype interactions to spatially confine phosphoric acid network in pores and facilitate proton conduction&#160;  via  &#160;deprotonation. The materials exhibit ultrafast and stable proton conduction at low proton carrier content &#160;and activation energy &#8211;&#160;a set of features highly desired for proton transport. Our results thus open a way to design porous polybenzimidazoles for energy conversions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiodivergent Kinetic Resolution of 1,1'&#8208;Biaryl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;Diols and Amino Alcohols by Dipeptide&#8208;Phosphonium Salt Catalysis Inspired by the Atherton&#8208;Todd Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we disclose a highly enantiodivergent organocatalytic protocol towards the synthesis of atropisomeric biaryls, through a kinetic resolution inspired by dipeptide&#8208;phosphonium salt&#8208;catalyzed Atherton&#8208;Todd (A&#8208;T) reaction. This flexible approach led to both R&#8208; and S&#8208;enantiomers by fine&#8208;tuning of bifunctional phosphonium with excellent selectivity factors (s) of up to 1057 and 525, respectively. The potential of newly synthesized O&#8208;phosphorylated biaryl diols was illustrated by providing a platform for the synthesis of axially chiral organophosphorus compounds. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the bifunctional phosphonium halide catalyst differentiates between the in&#8208;situ generating P&#8208;species in the A&#8208;T process, mainly involving phosphoryl chloride and phosphoric anhydride, thus leading to highly enantiodivergent O&#8208;phosphorylation reactions; and furthermore hydrogen bonding interactions between the catalysts and phosphorus molecules were crucial in asymmetric induction.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized High Mannose&#8208;Specific Lectins for the Discovery of Type I Mannosidase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An engineered cyanovirin&#8208;N homolog that exhibits specificity for high mannose N&#8208;glycans has been constructed to aid type I &#945;&#8208;1,2&#8208;mannosidase inhibitor discovery and development. Engineering the lectins C&#8208;terminus permitted facile functionalization with fluorophores via a sortase and click strategy. The resulting lectin constructs exhibit specificity for cells inherently presenting high mannose N&#8208;glycans. Importantly, these lectin constructs can also be applied to assess changes in cell surface glycosylation induced by type I but not type II mannosidase inhibitors. The utility of the lectin to aid the discovery and development of type I mannosidase inhibitors was assessed by preparing kifunensine derivatives, which led to type I mannosidase inhibitors with nanomolar potency. Cumulatively, these findings reveal the specificity and utility of the functionalized cyanovirin&#8208;N homolog constructs, and highlight their potential to fulfill the need for high mannose&#8208;specific lectins.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Fast Alkali&#8208;ion Dynamics in Paramagnetic Battery Materials Combined with NMR and Deep&#8208;Potential Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) technique has received extensive attention in&#160;characterizing alkali&#8208;ion battery materials, due to it&#160;is highly sensitive for probing the local environment and dynamic information of atoms/ions. However, precise spectral assignment cannot be effectively carried out through conventional density functional theory (DFT) methodology for the high&#8208;rate battery materials at room temperature. Herein, combining DFT calculation of paramagnetic shift and deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulation&#160;to&#160;achieve the converged Na+  &#160;distribution at&#160;hundreds of nanoseconds,&#160;we obtain the statistically averaged paramagnetic shift which is in excellent agreement with ssNMR measurements.&#160;Accordingly,&#160;two&#160;  23Na shifts induced by different stacking&#160;sequences of transition metal layers are revealed in the fast chemically exchanged NMR spectra of P2&#8208;type Na2/3(Mg1/3Mn2/3)O2  &#160;for the first time.&#160;This&#160;new&#160;DPMD simulation auxiliary&#160;protocol presented in this work can be beneficial to&#160;a wide range of ssNMR analysis&#160;in the fast chemically exchanged material systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Imaging of Hierarchical Porosity Formation within a Zeolite Crystal Visualized by Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;Ray Scattering and In&#8208;Situ Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing hierarchical porosity to zeolites is vital for providing molecular access to microporous domains. Yet, the dynamics of meso&#8208; and macropore formation has remained elusive and pore space ill&#8208;characterized by a lack of (  in&#8208;situ  ) microscopic tools sensitive to nanoporosity. Here, we probe hierarchical porosity formation within a zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 crystal in real&#8208;time by  in&#8208;situ  fluorescence microscopy during desilication. In addition, we introduce small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering microscopy as novel characterization tool to map intracrystal meso&#8208; and macropore properties. It is shown that hierarchical porosity formation initiates at the crystal surface and propagates to the crystal core  via  a pore front with decreasing rate. Also, hierarchical porosity only establishes in specific (segments of) subunits which constitute ZSM&#8208;5. Such space&#8208;dependent meso&#8208; and macroporosity implies local discrepancies in diffusion, performance and deactivation behaviors even within a zeolite crystal.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Organic Nanoparticles with Programable Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer for NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Anti&#8208;Bacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extensive recent efforts have been put on the design of high&#8208;performance organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal agents (PTAs), especially over NIR&#8208;II bio&#8208;window (1000&#8208;1350 nm). So far, the development is mainly limited by the rarity of molecules with good NIR&#8208;II response. Here, we report organic nanoparticles of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer complexes (CTCs) with easily programmable optical absorption. By employing different common donor and acceptor molecules to form CTC nanoparticles (CT NPs), absorption peaks of CT NPs can be controllably tuned from the NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II region. Notably, CT NPs formed with perylene and TCNQ have a considerably red&#8208;shifted absorption peak at 1040 nm and achieves a good photothermal conversion efficiency of 42% under 1064 nm excitation. These nanoparticles were used for antibacterial application with effective activity towards both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. This work opens a new avenue into the development of efficient PTAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Macroscopic Ultralight Aerogel Monoliths of Imine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in practical applications demands shaping them into macroscopic objects, which remains challenging. Herein, we report a simple three&#8208;step method to produce COF aerogels, based on sol&#8208;gel transition, solvent&#8208;exchange, and supercritical CO  2  drying, in which 2D imine&#8208;based COF sheets link together to form hierarchical porous structures. The resultant COF aerogel monoliths have extremely low densities (  ca  . 0.02 g cm  &#8208;3  ), high porosity (total porosity values of  ca  . 99 %), and mechanically behave as elastic materials under a moderate strain (&lt; 25&#8208;35 %) but become plastic under greater strain. Moreover, these COF aerogels maintain the micro&#8208; and meso&#8208;porosity of their constituent COFs, and show excellent absorption capacity (  e.g.  toluene uptake: 32 g g  &#8208;1  ), with high removal efficiency (  ca  . 99 %). Finally, we show that the same three&#8208;step method can be used to create functional composites of these COF aerogels with nanomaterials. We hope that our new procedure paves the way to a wider variety of macroscopic COF&#8208;based aerogels.</dc:description>

Moreover, these COF aerogels maintain the micro&#8208; and meso&#8208;porosity of their constituent COFs, and show excellent absorption capacity (  e.g.  toluene uptake: 32 g g  &#8208;1  ), with high removal efficiency (  ca  . 99 %). Finally, we show that the same three&#8208;step method can be used to create functional composites of these COF aerogels with nanomaterials. We hope that our new procedure paves the way to a wider variety of macroscopic COF&#8208;based aerogels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Herein, we show how the chaotropic effect arising from reduced molybdate ions in acidified aqueous solution is able to amplify drastically weak supramolecular interactions. Time&#8208;resolved Small Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (SAXS) analysis&#160; suggests that molybdenum&#8208;blue oligomeric species form huge aggregates in the presence of g&#8208;cyclodextrin (g&#8208;CD) which results in the fast formation of nanoscopic {Mo  154  }&#8208;based host&#8208;guest species, while X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the ending&#8208;point of the scenario results in an unprecedented three&#8208;component well&#8208;ordered core&#8208;shell&#8208;like motif. A similar arrangement was found by using preformed hexarhenium chalcogenide&#8208;type cluster [Re  6  Te  8  (CN)  6  ]  4&#8208;  as exogenous guest. This seminal work brings better understanding of the self&#8208;assembly processes in general and gives new opportunities for practical applications in the design of complex multicomponent materials via the simplicity of the non&#8208;covalent chemistry.</dc:description>
