         <title>The Natural Redox Cofactor Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ) Enables Photocatalytic Radical Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural alcohol and sugar dehydrogenases that utilize the redox cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) can be repurposed for enantioselective photoredox catalysis. Upon blue&#8208;light irradiation, redox&#8208;neutral radical cyclizations are catalyzed. This work adds a new class of enzymes to the toolbox of photobiocatalysis.








Abstract
Photoenzymatic catalysis facilitates stereoselective new&#8208;to&#8208;nature chemistry under mild conditions. In addition to the rational design of artificial photoenzymes, naturally occurring redox enzymes can be repurposed to promote photoredox catalysis in the chiral protein environment. Here, we show that enzymes utilizing the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) cofactor expand the toolbox of photobiocatalysis. PQQ absorbs visible light and is capable of single&#8208;electron transfer. It thus exhibits mechanistic similarities to flavin cofactors, which are widely used for photoenzymatic approaches. First, we established the trimethyl ester PQQMe3 as a stand&#8208;alone photoredox catalyst in pure organic solvent. Upon excitation, PQQMe3 enables the redox&#8208;neutral radical cyclization of an N&#8208;(bromoalkyl)&#8208;substituted indole. We then tested a panel of PQQ&#8208;dependent sugar and alcohol dehydrogenases for photoenzymatic catalysis in aqueous buffer, focusing on a redox&#8208;neutral radical reaction to form oxindoles. Under optimized reaction conditions, we obtained a 69% yield and an 82:18 enantiomeric ratio. Our work thus demonstrates that PQQ enzymes are capable of stereoselective photoredox catalysis. Future enzyme engineering efforts based on computational modeling and directed evolution will fully unlock their synthetic potential.

         <title>Synthesis of Gold Hydride at High Pressure and High Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold compressed in the presence of a hydrocarbon hydrogen source was heated with an X&#8208;ray free electron laser in a pump&#8208;probe experiment. Above 40&#160;GPa and 2200&#160;K, it reacts to form hexagonal gold hydride. The hydrogen is superionic in the gold lattice and diffuses freely. Gold is usually known as an unreactive metal, and its enhanced reactivity under extreme conditions points to modifications to chemistry in this regime, as explained by Mungo Frost et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202505811).

         <title>Assessing Fluorosulfonyl Pentafluorooxosulfate (FSO2&#8211;OSF5) Reservoir Capacity: Selective SOF4, SO2F2, and [OSF5]&#8211; Anion Release</title>

         <dc:description>
Tidying away gases and anions. The complementary storage &amp; in&#8208;solution release of tetrafluoride (SOF4), sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) and pentafluorooxosulfate (OSF5) anions was achieved. This was performed using fluorosulfonyl pentafluorooxosulfate (FSO2&#8208;OSF5) a stable, high boiling liquid, obtained from SO2 and the pentafluorosulfur hypofluorite (FOSF5) prepared quantitatively in gram&#8208;scale. Here, the gas free anion precursor of the emerging OSF5 chemistry and a dual&#8208;SuFEx reagent for one&#8208;pot synthesis of Sulfonyl fluoride (&#9472;SO2F) and Sulfurimidoyl Fluoride (&#9472;N&#9552;S(O)F2) is presented.








Abstract
Herein, the investigation of inorganic reagents containing the pentafluorooxosulfate (OSF5) moiety is presented. First, the gram&#8208;scale preparation of the reactive yet stable pentafluorosulfur hypofluorite (FOSF5) as well as its spectroscopic data are reported. Then, the preparation and full characterization of the corresponding fluorosulfonyl pentafluorooxosulfate (FSO3SF5, FSPO) by the fluoro&#8208;pentafluorooxosulfanylation of SO2 are highlighted. This liquid reagent (b.p. 39.6&#160;&#176;C) was later successfully used for modulable release of [cat][OSF5] ion&#8208;pair. The selective, in&#8208;solution release of SOF4 and SOF4/SO2F2 species was also demonstrated. Finally, the SuFEx reactivity was investigated and showed interesting reservoir ability. Indeed, we report the one&#8208;pot synthesis of sulfonyl fluoride (&#8208;SO2F) and sulfurimidoyl fluoride (&#9472;N&#9552;S(O)F2) species.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Indium Single&#8208;Atom Sites Anchored on a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Single&#8208;Layer Boosts Electroreduction of CO2 Into Formic Acid</title>

         <dc:description>
A single low&#8208;coordination indium(III) site anchored on a metal&#8208;organic framework can simultaneously bind and convert two carbon dioxide molecules into two formate products.








Abstract
The electroreduction of CO2 under acidic conditions presents both scientific significance and technical challenges. Herein, we developed a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy to anchor unexpected tetrahedral In(III) ions onto Zr&#8208;oxo clusters of a single&#8208;layer zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (denoted as Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In). Operating under harsh acidic conditions (pH&#160;=&#160;1.67) at&#160;&#8722;1.8&#160;V versus RHE, the Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance with 95.7% Faradaic efficiency for formic acid production and a current density of 213.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The system maintains operational stability over 20&#160;h without notable activity decay. Remarkably, when integrated into a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with solid&#8208;state electrolyte at 4&#160;V full&#8208;cell voltage, Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In continuously generates pure formic acid solution (505.5&#160;mmol&#160;L&#8722;1, 100% purity) free of electrolyte contamination, achieving a concentration 1.5&#8208;fold higher than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Mechanistic investigations identify dual enhancement mechanisms: i) the low&#8208;coordinated In(III) single&#8208;atom sites facilitate dual *HCOO intermediate binding, enhancing reaction kinetics beyond conventional single&#8208;intermediate adsorption on high&#8208;coordination metal centers; and ii) the single&#8208;layer MOF configuration optimizes active site exposure, synergistically maximizing catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Diboration of 1,2&#8208;Dihydropyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic enantioselective diboration of dihydropyridines is described that provides an inroad for the construction of substituted piperidine motifs. Insight into the reaction mechanism was gained by DFT experiments, and the reaction products were applied in the construction of relevant heterocyclic intermediates.








Abstract
Dihydropyridines undergo enantioselective 1,4&#8208;diboration in the presence of a chiral Pt&#8208;based catalyst. The resulting diboryl piperidines can undergo diverse stereospecific cross&#8208;couplings, allowing the construction of an array of different substituted chiral piperidines. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insight into a plausible diboration pathway that involves a platinum&#8208;centered reaction between coordinated B2L2 reagent and the diene to furnish an intermediate &#960;&#8211;allyl platinum complex.

         <title>Rhenium&#8208;Doping to Promote Structural Evolution of Metallic Iridium to Oxides on Platinum Nanowire Bundles for Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing Ir loading is critical for the Gigawatt&#8208;scale implementation of PEM water electrolyzers. Here, we report an ultra&#8208;low Ir anode architecture consisting of Re&#8208;doped Ir nanoparticles anchored at Pt nanowire networks. The Re dopant accelerates the electrochemical conversion of metallic Ir to active IrOx, while the Pt nanowire support enhances catalyst utilization and electron/mass transport. Both factors, at different scales, together contribute to the performance and durability improvements of a low Ir anode.








Abstract
The current high Ir loading (&#8764;2&#160;mgIr&#160;cm&#8722;2) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) severely hinders their applications for green hydrogen production. Reducing Ir loading while maintaining high performance and durability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) anode is critical for the Gigawatt&#8208;scale deployment of PEMWEs. Herein, we report an ultra&#8208;low Ir anode, consisting of Re&#8208;doped Ir nanoparticles anchored on Pt nanowire networks, enabling rational catalyst design at the atomic scale and electrode structure engineering at the nanoscale. The unique doping of Re into Ir was explored as an effective strategy to promote the desirable conversion from metallic Ir to amorphous IrOx during the acidic OER, thus benefiting intrinsic activity and stability enhancements. Notably, the Pt nanowire bundles serve as a support to enhance electrical conductivity and provide a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area, robust, and interconnected electrode structure, significantly increasing Ir utilization and electron/mass transport at the device level. Three&#8208;electrode electrochemical tests revealed that the developed Ir catalyst exhibits a 100% increase in electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and a 160% enhancement in intrinsic OER activity compared to commercial Ir black catalysts. The optimized Ir anode achieved a current density of 3.0&#160;A cm&#8722;2 at 1.69&#160;V (0.2&#160;mgIr cm&#8722;2) and 1.73&#160;V (0.1&#160;mgIr cm&#8722;2) in membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), exceeding the US DOE 2026 targets (0.5&#160;mgPGM cm&#8722;2 at 1.8&#160;V for 3.0 A cm&#8722;2). The corresponding MEAs also demonstrated compelling long&#8208;term durability, as evidenced by a low voltage degradation rate of 26&#160;&#181;V h&#8722;1 over 1100 hours of operation and 0.8&#160;&#181;V cycle&#8722;1 during an accelerated stress test.

         <title>Robust Imidazole&#8208;Linked 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Electrochemical Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two robust imidazole&#8208;linked 2D COFs were developed through facile one&#8208;pot cyclocondensation reactions as the anodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Remarkably, TAPT&#8208;COF delivered a high reversible capacity of 517 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1 with remarkable cycling performance (&lt;0.035% per cycle capacity decay over 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). This superior performance stems from synergistic interplay between the stabilized imidazole linkage and abundant C&#9552;O/C&#9552;N redox&#8208;active centers.








Abstract
Exploring stable and functional linkages through facile one&#8208;pot cyclocondensation reactions represents one of the frontiers in the development of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which can enhance structural robustness and diversity while broadening their application potential. In this study, we report a facile synthetic strategy using p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) as a proton mediator to construct two imidazole&#8208;linked COFs (TABQ&#8208;COF and TAPT&#8208;COF) via one&#8208;pot cyclocondensation of aromatic aldehydes with ortho&#8208;diamines. These two COFs not only possess good crystallinity but also exhibit excellent physicochemical stability and contain abundant redox&#8208;active sites, which endows them with charming advantages for electrochemical energy storage. Remarkably, when employed as an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), TAPT&#8208;COF delivered a reversible capacity of 517 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1 while maintaining outstanding cycling stability with minimal capacity degradation (&lt;0.035% per cycle) over 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8722;1. This superior performance stems from synergistic contributions of abundant redox&#8208;active centers (C&#9552;O and C&#9552;N groups), which enable efficient Na+ storage through multielectron redox mechanisms. This study highlights the strategic advantage of structurally stable COFs with precisely engineered redox&#8208;active motifs via facile synthesis for advancing high&#8208;performance electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Radical C&#9472;H&#8208;Aroylation of Allenes via Cooperative Photoredox and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and photoredox catalysis for C&#9472;H benzoylation and esterification of allenes is presented. This reaction proceeds through the cross&#8208;coupling of in situ generated ketyl and allyl radicals.








Abstract
This study demonstrates the use of cooperative photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis for sp2 C&#9472;H acylation of allenes. The cascade comprises oxidative generation of an allene radical cation from an allene, its nucleophilic trapping to the corresponding allyl radical and highly regioselective cross coupling by a concomitantly reductively generated NHC&#8208;derived ketyl type radical. Ionic fragmentation of both the NHC and nucleophile ultimately yields the desired substituted allene. The organic photocatalyst, 4CzIPN, is highly effective in promoting both oxidative and reductive electron transfer steps. Tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted allenes can be obtained in good yields through such a cascade. Mechanistic studies&#8212;including radical trapping, acylazolium reactions, and Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching&#8212;support the proposed mechanism. Moreover, follow&#8208;up chemistry is conducted to demonstrate the synthetic value of the cascade products.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Digital Immunoassay in Homogenous Format by Singlet&#8208;Oxygen Activated Up&#8208;conversion Luminescence</title>

Herein, based upon a pair of labeled antibodies, one labeled with a singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) nano&#8208;generator of porphyrin&#8208;metal organic framework (pMOF) and the other tagged using an upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) nano&#8208;reporter with luminescence caged by 1O2&#8208;cleavable quenchers, a singlet&#8208;oxygen activated up&#8208;conversion luminescence assay (SOLA) was developed for ultrasensitive protein detection, allowing a single&#8208;step, no&#8208;wash format for digital protein detection with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, wide dynamic range and atto&#8208;molar detection limit.








Abstract
New diagnostic tools for accurately detecting extremely low levels of protein biomarkers in the bloodstream are essential for a wide range of clinical applications. We develop a singlet&#8208;oxygen activated up&#8208;conversion luminescence assay (SOLA) that enables ultrasensitive digital immunometric detection of protein biomarkers in homogenous format with no wash steps. This approach designs a pair of labeled antibodies, one labeled with a singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) nanogenerator of porphyrin&#8208;metal organic framework (pMOF) and the other tagged using an upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) nanoreporter with luminescence caged by 1O2&#8208;cleavable quenchers. Formation of sandwiched complex between target protein and antibody pairs mediates close proximity between 1O2&#8208;generator and UCNP reporter, enabling efficient diffusion of 1O2 around the reporter to activate its luminescence through cleaving off the quenchers. This approach is demonstrated to be capable of activating detectable fluorescence from a single UCNP reporter with a single&#8208;molecule protein target. A digital homogeneous immunoassay strategy is also developed for ultrasensitive protein detection, allowing a single&#8208;step, no&#8208;wash format for digital protein detection with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, wide dynamic range and atto&#8208;molar detection limit. The SOLA assay may provide an invaluable paradigm for developing highly accessible and ultrasensitive tools for diagnostics and biomarker discovery.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, based upon a pair of labeled antibodies, one labeled with a singlet-oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) nano-generator of porphyrin-metal organic framework (pMOF) and the other tagged using an upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) nano-reporter with luminescence caged by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-cleavable quenchers, a singlet-oxygen activated up-conversion luminescence assay (SOLA) was developed for ultrasensitive protein detection, allowing a single-step, no-wash format for digital protein detection with high signal-to-background ratio, wide dynamic range and atto-molar detection limit.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New diagnostic tools for accurately detecting extremely low levels of protein biomarkers in the bloodstream are essential for a wide range of clinical applications. We develop a singlet-oxygen activated up-conversion luminescence assay (SOLA) that enables ultrasensitive digital immunometric detection of protein biomarkers in homogenous format with no wash steps. This approach designs a pair of labeled antibodies, one labeled with a singlet-oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) nanogenerator of porphyrin-metal organic framework (pMOF) and the other tagged using an upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) nanoreporter with luminescence caged by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-cleavable quenchers. Formation of sandwiched complex between target protein and antibody pairs mediates close proximity between &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-generator and UCNP reporter, enabling efficient diffusion of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; around the reporter to activate its luminescence through cleaving off the quenchers. This approach is demonstrated to be capable of activating detectable fluorescence from a single UCNP reporter with a single-molecule protein target. A digital homogeneous immunoassay strategy is also developed for ultrasensitive protein detection, allowing a single-step, no-wash format for digital protein detection with high signal-to-background ratio, wide dynamic range and atto-molar detection limit. The SOLA assay may provide an invaluable paradigm for developing highly accessible and ultrasensitive tools for diagnostics and biomarker discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Progressive Learning&#8208;Guided Discovery of Single&#8208;Atom Metal Oxide Catalysts for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a progressive learning framework that integrates DFT and machine learning to enhance prediction accuracy and sensitivity for rare, high&#8208;performance OER catalysts. By iteratively learning adsorption energies as auxiliary features, the model overcomes limitations of traditional scaling relationships and identifies top&#8208;performing single&#8208;atom&#8208;doped metal oxides. Experimental validation confirms the predicted activity and durability of MnSA&#8208;RuO2.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key bottleneck in clean energy conversion due to sluggish kinetics and high overpotentials. Transition metal single&#8208;atom catalysts offer great promise for OER optimization thanks to their high atomic efficiency and tunable electronic structures. However, intrinsic scaling relationships between adsorbed intermediates limit catalytic performance and complicate discovery through conventional machine learning (ML). To overcome this, we combined density functional theory (DFT) with a progressive learning strategy within an active learning framework. By first predicting adsorption energies as auxiliary features, our ML model achieved improved sensitivity to rare, high&#8208;activity candidates. High&#8208;throughput screening of 261 transition metal single&#8208;atom&#8208;doped metal oxides (MSA&#8208;MOx) identified nine top&#8208;performing catalysts (theoretical overpotential&#160;&lt;&#160;0.5&#160;V), including MnSA&#8208;RuO2 and FeSA&#8208;TiO2 (theoretical overpotential&#160;&lt;&#160;0.3&#160;V). Data mining revealed key theoretical descriptors governing OER activity, while electronic structure analysis pinpointed intermediate binding strength as the key performance driver. Further constant&#8208;potential DFT calculations and experimental evaluation of MnSA&#8208;RuO2 confirmed its low overpotential and excellent durability under acidic conditions. This integrated framework, which connects theoretical modeling, ML prediction, and experimental validation, accelerates the discovery of efficient OER catalysts and provides mechanistic insights for the rational design of materials in sustainable energy technologies.

         <title>Surface Protected Organozirconium Catalyzes C&#9472;H Alumination of Saturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#9472;H alumination of saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons is catalyzed by surface&#8208;grafted organozirconium species, with high selectivity for the least&#8208;hindered, terminal position, enabled by selective silylation of a small number of residual silanols in the catalyst. Exclusive mono&#8208;alumination of methane is accomplished with more than 70 turnovers. 








Abstract
Surface grafted organozirconium catalyzes C&#9472;H/Et&#9472;Al exchange reactions, involving saturated hydrocarbons and AlEt3, to afford organoaluminum compounds and ethane. The Zr(OtBu)3@SiO2&#8208;Al2O3&#8211;700 (1) catalyst contains monopodal &#8801;SiO&#9472;Zr(OtBu)3 and only a few residual silanols (&lt;5%). Nonetheless, these silanols are the Achille's heel of 1, providing a pathway for surface and catalyst degradation during catalysis, limiting the alkylaluminum yield and catalyst turnover. Support degradation, involving the cleavage of Si&#9472;O bonds by activated surface organometallics, is inhibited by capping silanols with &#9472;SiMe3. Residual silanols in 1 react with allyltrimethylsilane, as determined by solid&#8208;state 13C and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and reaction stoichiometry, to form Zr(OtBu)3/SiMe3@SiO2&#8208;Al2O3&#8211;700 (2), which is resistant to degradation by AlEt3. C&#9472;H alumination of dodecane catalyzed by 2 produces higher yields of the 1&#8208;dodecylaluminum product in comparison to 1, and in &gt;95% selectivity. Additionally, methane undergoes 2&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H alumination, providing a route to AlMe3.

         <title>Controllable Preparation of Hierarchically Charge&#8208;Separated Interface to Effectively Promote the Desolvation and Kinetics of Lithium Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel BPQDs/GDYNTs electrode, fabricated by uniformly decorating black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) on graphdiyne nanotubes (GDYNTs), generates a charge&#8208;separated interface that in situ induces an inorganic&#8208;components&#8208;enriched solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). This SEI enhances Li&#8208;ion desolvation and kinetics, enabling the BPQDs/GDYNTs to achieve fast&#8208;charging capability and remarkable longevity of lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is one of the key factors to determine the performance of batteries. Electrolyte additives enhance SEI performance for fast charging and long cycle life but introduce system&#8208;level uncertainties, including cathode degradation, safety hazards, and cost escalation. In this study, we prepare a composite electrode (BPQDs/GDYNTs) featuring a charge&#8208;separated interface structure to improve the SEI directly without auxiliary additives. The BPQDs/GDYNTs are comprised of graphdiyne tubes (GDYNTs) with black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) distributed on the surface. The charge transfer between BPQDs and GDYNTs creates a charge&#8208;separated interface, thereby enabling the efficient adsorption of lithium (Li) ions by the electron&#8208;rich state of GDYNTs while promoting the adsorption of hexafluorophosphate anion (PF6&#8722;) on the electron&#8208;deficient state of BPQDs. That facilitates the in situ formation of a thin and inorganic&#8208;rich SEI containing fluorine&#8208; and phosphorus&#8208;based species, which significantly enhances both the desolvation of Li&#8208;ions and their kinetics. When utilized as the anode of Li&#8208;ion batteries, the BPQDs/GDYNTs electrode exhibits fast&#8208;charging capability and remarkable longevity, demonstrating ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance over 50&#160;000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g&#8722;1 with negligible capacity decay.

         <title>Imaging&#8208;Based High&#8208;Content Screening with Clickable Probes Identifies XPB Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study introduces TL&#8208;alkyne as an innovative tool for bio&#8208;orthogonal labeling of endogenous XPB in live cells, facilitating the creation of a cell&#8208;based imaging HCS assay. This platform not only enabled the identification of pelitinib as a novel XPB inhibitor but also demonstrated its potential to improve cancer treatment through synergistic effects with chemotherapy.








Abstract
High&#8208;content screening (HCS) has become a powerful tool in drug discovery; however, its reliance on indirect readouts and surrogate markers limits HCS's ability to directly assess drug&#8208;protein interactions at endogenous levels, particularly in subcellular contexts. Here, we report an approach to address these limitations by combining confocal imaging&#8208;based HCS and bio&#8208;orthogonal labeling with clickable probes. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we synthesized a probe Triptolide&#8208;alkyne (TL&#8208;alk) that rapidly and specifically labels xeroderma pigmentosum type B (XPB), a critical protein in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Probe&#8208;labeled XPB was conjugated to TAMRA to visualize the occupation of active sites, and EGFP and DAPI signals indicated XPB expression in the nucleus. Such a colorimetric HCS assay enabled the direct and precise measurement of drug occupancy rates in nuclear XPB of live cells. With this platform, pelitinib was identified as a novel ligand to bind XPB out of 1874 compounds containing. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#8208;approved drugs. Pelitinib formed a covalent bond with cysteine residue 342 of XPB, suppressed XPB's ATPase activity, impaired NER, and synergistically enhanced chemotherapy. This study not only overcomes limitations of HCS, but also demonstrates the transformative potential of bio&#8208;orthogonal labeling, such as in integration with HCS technologies, offering a novel framework for drug discovery targeting challenging protein systems.

&lt;p&gt;High-content screening (HCS) has become a powerful tool in drug discovery; however, its reliance on indirect readouts and surrogate markers limits HCS's ability to directly assess drug-protein interactions at endogenous levels, particularly in subcellular contexts. Here, we report an approach to address these limitations by combining confocal imaging-based HCS and bio-orthogonal labeling with clickable probes. As a proof-of-concept, we synthesized a probe Triptolide-alkyne (TL-alk) that rapidly and specifically labels xeroderma pigmentosum type B (XPB), a critical protein in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Probe-labeled XPB was conjugated to TAMRA to visualize the occupation of active sites, and EGFP and DAPI signals indicated XPB expression in the nucleus. Such a colorimetric HCS assay enabled the direct and precise measurement of drug occupancy rates in nuclear XPB of live cells. With this platform, pelitinib was identified as a novel ligand to bind XPB out of 1874 compounds containing. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Pelitinib formed a covalent bond with cysteine residue 342 of XPB, suppressed XPB's ATPase activity, impaired NER, and synergistically enhanced chemotherapy. This study not only overcomes limitations of HCS, but also demonstrates the transformative potential of bio-orthogonal labeling, such as in integration with HCS technologies, offering a novel framework for drug discovery targeting challenging protein systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Electrochemical Study of Key Catalytically Active Gold Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic electrochemical investigation of Au(I) complexes sheds light on how ligand environments control gold oxidizability. Through cyclic voltammetry and density functional theory (DFT) analysis, key trends are established for phosphine, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC), and hemilabile P^N ligands, offering valuable insights into the design of efficient Au(I)/Au(III) catalytic cycles.








Abstract
Gold catalysis has long been dominated by the ability of gold(I) to activate unsaturated systems as a carbophilic Lewis acid. However, recent advances have highlighted the significance of Au(I)/Au(III) redox transitions, unlocking new catalytic pathways. Among the strategies facilitating these oxidative processes, electrochemical anodic oxidation has emerged as a powerful tool. Despite its potential, the electrochemical properties of key gold complexes remain largely underexplored. In this study, we systematically investigate the oxidative behavior of a series of gold complexes using cyclic voltammetry. A comprehensive electrochemical scale is established, revealing that N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;based gold complexes are among the least prone to oxidation, whereas phosphorylated ligands significantly enhance oxidizability. Within triphenylphosphine gold complexes, the nature of the X&#8208;type anionic ligand plays a crucial role in determining oxidative behavior, a trend rationalized through density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Additionally, hemilabile P^N ligands dramatically facilitate oxidation, correlating with their ability to promote oxidative addition. These findings provide fundamental insights into the redox properties of gold complexes, offering valuable guidelines for the design of new gold&#8208;catalyzed transformations.

         <title>Electrochemical Polymerization of 1,2&#8208;Dithiolane Derivatives at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of thioctic acid and its derivatives has been developed under ambient and open&#8208;atmosphere condition. This innovative method shows high efficiency, rapid polymerization kinetics, easy handling, and broad applicability to a range of substrates. The resulting polydisulfides exhibit high conversion, strong adhesion, and impact&#8208;protective properties, enabling the generation of apparent antivibration coating.








Abstract
Recently, 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes derived polydisulfides have prompted growing research interests. An innovative polymerization method with convenient operation under mild conditions is needed for improving monomer conversion, polymerization degree, and bulk performance. Here, we report an electrochemically initiated ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of thioctic acid (TA) monomers and its derivatives at room temperature, with high monomer conversion and polymerization degree. The resulting polymer exhibits potential as a transparent and vibration&#8208;damping coating. Electrochemical oxidation was the key step for initiating the rapidly polymerization and could completely circumvent the use of chemical initiators or harsh conditions. Cyclic voltammetry experiments identified the oxidation of TA at anode accompanying with an absorption&#8208;controlled one&#8208;electron transfer process. Together with density functional theory calculations, we proposed a cationic radical&#8208;initiated polymerization process. This unique electrochemical polymerization strategy was simple, rapid, efficient, and applicable for diverse TA&#8208;derived monomers.

         <title>The Role of Hydrogen Bonding in the Formation and Dynamics of Two Distinct Types of Cyclic Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic supramolecular polymer (SP), resembling a cyclic covalent polymer in terms of both its appearance and the cyclization mechanism, was found and characterized using high&#8208;speed atomic force microscopy. Here, dynamic hydrogen bonding played an important role in endowing the polymeric chain with flexibility.








Abstract
Cyclic polymers are attractive synthetic targets in both polymer chemistry and supramolecular polymer (SP) chemistry; however, there is a gap between these two research fields in terms of the synthetic strategies involved, and achieving a commonality remains elusive. Herein, we describe the formation of two distinct types of cyclic SPs from structurally similar rosette&#8208;shaped molecules. The first SP (Type I) is characterized by a uniform diameter and circularity, whereas the other (Type II) has properties reminiscent of flexible cyclic covalent polymers. Remarkably, the only difference in the structures of the two monomers that form these completely distinct cyclic SPs is the absence (Type I) or presence (Type II) of hydrogen&#8208;bonding moieties. An all&#8208;atom molecular&#8208;dynamics simulation suggested that the Type II SP can adopt various &#8220;conformations&#8221; due to the dynamic nature of its hydrogen bonds, thereby behaving like a flexible covalent polymer. Real&#8208;time high&#8208;speed atomic&#8208;force microscopy (AFM) confirmed the presence of flexibility in the chains of the Type II SP on the observation timescale (several tens of seconds). Our results therefore highlight an example of a similarity between a covalent polymer and a noncovalent SP that should help to bridge the gap between these polymers, leading to new advanced materials.

         <title>Balancing Tetrahedral and Cation Entropies for Long&#8208;lifespan Low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to enhance low&#8208;temperature cycling stability in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries by balancing tetrahedral and cation entropies in hybrid electrolytes. By optimizing solvent ratios, the trend of the two entropy values is quantitatively analyzed and optimized, so as to maintain high cyclic stability while having excellent freezing resistance.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, their application is hindered by Zn anode instability and reduced ionic conductivity at low temperatures. Here, we identified two decisive factors for low&#8208;temperature performance and anode stability of batteries: tetrahedral entropy and cation entropy. The former is closely related to antifreezing ability of electrolyte, while the latter is associated with the desolvation kinetics of Zn2+. We propose an effective strategy to balance the above two thermodynamic quantities by precisely tuning the molar fraction of the 1,3&#8208;butanediol (BDO) cosolvent with notable glass&#8208;forming ability. BDO enhances the tetrahedral entropy due to the disruption of the hydrogen&#8208;bond networks among water molecules, decreasing the solid&#8211;liquid transition temperature from &#8722;16.4 to &#8722;101&#160;&#176;C. Additionally, BDO modifies the solvated structure of Zn2&#8314; to limit the active water content, thus suppressing by&#8208;reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The optimized electrolyte enables long&#8208;term cycling of Zn||Zn symmetric cells for over 4000&#160;h at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C under 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/0.1&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2, and renders PANI||Zn full cells capable of working across a broad temperature range (&#8722;40&#160;&#176;C to 60&#160;&#176;C). This work offers a guideline to design stable and low&#8208;temperature AZIBs, expanding the application scope for aqueous electrolytes.

         <title>&#8220;Strong Assisting Weak&#8221; Effect for Long&#8208;Lived Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Host&#8211;Guest&#8208;Doped Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of &#8220;strong assisting weak&#8221; was proposed, wherein 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) serves as the host and naphthalene (NL) as the guest. The host, possessing a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect, is capable of effectively triggering the phosphorescence of the guest that exhibits weak intersystem crossing (ISC). Moreover, the relatively long lifetime of the guest is preserved.








Abstract
Organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, with long lifetime, large Stokes shift, and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, have great potential in numerous fields. And now, the host&#8211;guest&#8208;doped systems have become an effective approach for facilitating RTP, regardless of the still unclear inherent mechanism. In this work, a series of host&#8211;guest&#8208;doped RTP materials were constructed, and based on experimental results, the &#8220;strong assisting weak&#8221; effect was proposed. That is, the host with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect can effectively enhance the phosphorescence of the guest with weak intersystem crossing (ISC), while maintaining the guest's relatively long lifetime. With 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as the host and naphthalene (NL) as the guest, the long RTP lifetime of 1.79&#160;s could be achieved, which is obviously longer than 0.5&#160;s of NL@ polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (TTET) process from the dark triplet excitons of DMAP to NL was found to play the key role in triggering RTP of NL.

     alt="&#8220;Strong Assisting Weak&#8221; Effect for Long-Lived Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Host&#8211;Guest-Doped Systems"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of &#8220;strong assisting weak&#8221; was proposed, wherein 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) serves as the host and naphthalene (NL) as the guest. The host, possessing a strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect, is capable of effectively triggering the phosphorescence of the guest that exhibits weak intersystem crossing (ISC). Moreover, the relatively long lifetime of the guest is preserved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, with long lifetime, large Stokes shift, and high signal-to-noise ratio, have great potential in numerous fields. And now, the host&#8211;guest-doped systems have become an effective approach for facilitating RTP, regardless of the still unclear inherent mechanism. In this work, a series of host&#8211;guest-doped RTP materials were constructed, and based on experimental results, the &#8220;strong assisting weak&#8221; effect was proposed. That is, the host with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect can effectively enhance the phosphorescence of the guest with weak intersystem crossing (ISC), while maintaining the guest's relatively long lifetime. With 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as the host and naphthalene (NL) as the guest, the long RTP lifetime of 1.79&#160;s could be achieved, which is obviously longer than 0.5&#160;s of NL@ polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (TTET) process from the dark triplet excitons of DMAP to NL was found to play the key role in triggering RTP of NL. These findings deepen our understandings of RTP mechanisms and provide practical guidance for the creation of highly efficient and long-lived RTP materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improved Ionic Thermoelectric Performance of Adhesive and Self&#8208;Healing Cationic High&#8208;Entropy Gel Thermocell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabricated cationic high&#8208;entropy gel (CHEG) GFK&#8208;Na+&#8722;Li+&#8208;Gdm+&#8722;Cs+ exhibits good adhesion and self&#8208;healing properties. CHEG thermocell delivers the high ionic thermoelectric (i&#8208;TE) performance with Si&#160;=&#160;41&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1 and Pmax/(&#8710;T)2&#160;=&#160;14.3&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;K&#8722;2 due to multi&#8208;ions interaction. The electricity produced by thermocell devices can electrocatalytically degrade water pollution. 








Abstract
Gel thermocell can directly convert heat into electricity by ions as energy carriers, capable of low&#8208;grade heat harvesting. However, ionic thermoelectric performance, including ionic thermopower, output power density, and energy density, needs to be significantly improved to meet practical applications. To date, it still lacks an effective strategy to focus on gels to achieve the overall high performance. Herein, an adhesive and self&#8208;healing cationic high&#8208;entropy gel (CHEG) G&#8208;FeCN4&#8722;/3&#8722;&#8208;K+&#8208;Na+&#8208;Li+&#8208;Gdm+&#8208;Cs+ in a multi&#8208;ion cooperative chemical environment has been designed by the interaction between multications and anions, improving the entropy change of redox reaction, exchange current density, and ionic conductivity, thereby achieving an overall high ionic thermoelectric performance. The CHEG thermocell using the synergy of thermogalvanic and thermodiffusion effects showed a total ionic thermopower of 41&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1 with 2.3&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1 for the former, and delivered a maximum output power density of 14.3&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;K&#8722;2 and an energy density of 4.5&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;K&#8722;2. In addition, an ultrahigh maximum output power density of 4.13&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;K&#8722;2 was obtained in the CHEG device that was assembled by connecting four thermocells in series, which could realize electrocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B. This work demonstrates a feasible way to design high&#8208;performance ionic thermoelectric gels and provides a new application in water pollution treatments.

         <title>Digital&#8208;Twin&#8208;Assisted Insights Into Irreversible Capacity and Activation Strategy Power High&#8208;Loading Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the origin of the rapid capacity fading of the cathodes with the increasing electrode thickness in the Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which stems from sluggish lithium diffusion in the solid&#8208;state electrolytes as a result of &#8220;sandwich&#8221; concentration gradients in the discharged electrode. With the help of 3D digital&#8208;twin electrodes and 4D&#8208;resolved simulations, an electrode scale irreversible&#8208;lithium model is firstly proposed, and an in situ photo&#8208;induced activation strategy enabled improved lithium diffusion in a high&#8208;loading electrode.








Abstract
In solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the fraction of active materials involved in electrode electrochemistry reduces with the increase of electrode thickness. Conventional wisdom suggests that the degree of reaction linearly decreases toward the current collector as in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which is, however, limited by the high difficulty of experimental capture of operando charge and mass transport. Electrode dynamics simulations can provide space visualization but are usually based on simplified models. Herein, we build digital&#8208;twin electrodes with digital&#8208;space voxel microstructure based on synchrotron tomography, which transforms the electrode architecture from real space to digital space for the construction of precision models. From the digital model&#8208;driven simulation, we find an &#8220;lithium trapping&#8221; effect, stemming from susceptible lithium stuck in the solid electrolyte, triggers an inadequate reaction of the intermediate region of electrodes. Then, we construct locally accelerated ion paths activating the lithium trapping, indicating that this strategy can significantly guide the sustainable battery design for next&#8208;generation energy storage.

         <title>Achieving Efficient Self&#8208;Driven Full&#8208;Stokes Photodetection in Optically Active Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports the first chiral&#8208;free, self&#8208;driven full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection in an optically active ferroelectric. The demonstrated device enables accurate characterization of the state of polarization with low Stokes parameter errors, offering a new route for compact polarization&#8208;sensitive optoelectronics.








Abstract
Full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection, enabling the acquisition of complete polarization information, is crucial across various fields such as target identification, robotic perception, and 3D reconstruction. Nevertheless, achieving efficient multiple polarization state detection simultaneously with high recognition accuracy in a compact device remains a significant challenge. Herein, for the first time, we report an optically active ferroelectric OA2EA2Pb3Br10 (1, where OA is n&#8208;octylammonium, EA is ethylammonium), capable of realizing a self&#8208;driven full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection. Utilizing the bulk photovoltaic effect in 1, simultaneous detection of both linearly and circularly polarized light can be achieved without requiring an external bias. The in&#8208;plane photodetection configuration exhibits a high linear polarization ratio of 2.7 and a circular polarization anisotropy factor of 0.46. More importantly, the full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection achieves low average measurement errors for the Stokes parameters of 3.2%&#8211;5.3%. This study establishes a new paradigm for the rational design of ferroelectric materials that enable self&#8208;driven, filterless full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection.

         <title>Realizing Unconventional Tandem Nitrate Reduction for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis Enabled by Co, Fe Dual&#8208;Site Conjugated Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distinctive unconventional tandem pathway for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia was achieved via [6&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;electron transfer processes of &#8220;HNO3 &#8594; *NH2OH&#8221; and &#8220;NH2OH &#8594; NH3&#8221; on Co,Fe dual&#8208;site conjugated metal organic frameworks.








Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a sustainable route for carbon&#8208;neutral chemical synthesis, while the intricate multi&#8208;electron/proton transfer processes and unstable intermediates pose significant challenges in attaining high selectivity and efficiency. This study demonstrates a Co, Fe bimetallic conjugated metal organic frameworks (CoFe&#8208;cMOFs) that enable efficient NO3RR via an unconventional [6&#160;+&#160;2] electron&#8208;transfer tandem pathway. Unlike the traditional [2&#160;+&#160;6] tandem pathway, the Fe sites predominantly reduce NO3&#8722; to *NH2OH intermediate, which subsequently spills over onto the Co sites for further protonation. This unconventional tandem pathway effectively avoids the release of NO2&#8722; and guarantees selective NH3 production. The CoFe&#8208;cMOFs achieve 94.3% NH3&#8208;producing Faradaic efficiency with a yield rate of 14.1&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in neutral electrolyte. The Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery prototype incorporating CoFe&#8208;cMOFs exhibits 3.6&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 peak power density with stable NH3 production. This work proposes a mechanistic breakthrough in tandem pathway regulation for selective electrochemical ammonia synthesis.

This study demonstrates a Co, Fe bimetallic conjugated metal organic frameworks (CoFe-cMOFs) that enable efficient NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR via an unconventional [6&#160;+&#160;2] electron-transfer tandem pathway. Unlike the traditional [2&#160;+&#160;6] tandem pathway, the Fe sites predominantly reduce NO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt; to *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH intermediate, which subsequently spills over onto the Co sites for further protonation. This unconventional tandem pathway effectively avoids the release of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt; and guarantees selective NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production. The CoFe-cMOFs achieve 94.3% NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-producing Faradaic efficiency with a yield rate of 14.1&#160;mg h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in neutral electrolyte. The Zn-NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; battery prototype incorporating CoFe-cMOFs exhibits 3.6&#160;mW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; peak power density with stable NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production. This work proposes a mechanistic breakthrough in tandem pathway regulation for selective electrochemical ammonia synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversing Pt/C Degradation Via Ni(OH)2&#8208;Wrapping Induced Spreading of Electric Field for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In electrocatalysis, the interfacial electron transfer driving the catalyst modulates the interfacial charge distribution, and the resulting interfacial electric field regulates the structure of the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), which directly affects the performance and stability of the catalyst. With the undifferentiated adsorption induced by the dispersion of the interfacial electric field, the activity and stability of the catalyst were significantly enhanced.








Abstract
Low mass activity due to unfavorable water dissociation and insufficient stability are two primary challenges for Pt catalysts. Herein, we find that the specific adsorption of solvent molecules in the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) leads to local environmental degradation in the Pt/C catalyst. So, we propose an encapsulation&#8208;confined strategy, by which a poriferous Ni(OH)2 on Pt nanocages (thereafter Pt/Ni(OH)2) was spatially wrapped to regulate charge transfer. As the heterogeneous interface enables spreading the surface electric field, the wrapped Ni(OH)2 layer not only optimizes the proton&#8208;coupled electron dynamics but also stabilizes the Pt sites via undifferentiated adsorption of solvent molecules in the IHP, as demonstrated by using identical location transmission electron microscopy (IL&#8208;TEM). Consequently, the Pt/Ni(OH)2 (11.85&#160;mA/mgPt at an overpotential of 70&#160;mV) achieves an excellent mass activity of 12.74 times higher than the commercial Pt/C and long&#8208;term durability in 1&#160;M KOH. Our work has gained insights into the architecture of microenvironments&#8208;involved interfaces.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Alkylphosphorus(V) Compounds Using Imidazolium Phosphonites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript describes a synthetic approach to a wide range of unsymmetrical alkylphosphorus(V) compounds using imidazolium phosphonites as bifunctional reagents. This protocol allows the introduction of primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl substituents and various heteroatom substituents onto the P(V) scaffold. In addition, a phosphorus radical species generated by the single electron reduction of alkyl imidazolium&#8208;P(V) enabled P&#9472;C bond formation by radical addition to alkenes.








Abstract
Here, we report a synthetic approach for a wide range of unsymmetrical alkylphosphorus(V) compounds, alkyl&#8208;P(O)XY (X &#8800; Y) using imidazolium phosphonites as bifunctional reagents. This protocol consists of two sequences, C(sp3)&#9472;P bond formation via an organic photoredox&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative alkylation of imidazolium phosphonites with aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives and P&#9472;X (X&#9552;O, N, F, and S) bond formation via the SNP(V) reaction. In this process, the imidazolium group facilitates 1) radical addition to the phosphonite reagent by stabilizing the resulting phosphoranyl radical intermediate and 2) the SNP(V) reaction as a good leaving group. This protocol allows the introduction of primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl substituents and various heteroatom substituents onto P(V) scaffolds.

         <title>Janus&#8208;Type Photophysics of Rotational Isomers in a Diphenylanthracene Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To fully grasp the genuine photophysical landscape of organic molecules, we must consider conformational isomerism arising from structural flexibility. Or else, this may mislead diverse mixtures of conformers to be assigned as a single ensemble. This work demonstrates Janus&#8208;type photophysics of rotamers in a diphenylanthracene dimer, highlighting different types of exciton coupling, charge transfer characteristics, and triplet formation mechanisms.








Abstract
Organic molecular dimers serve as valuable model systems for manipulating and exploring interchromophore interactions. However, the structural flexibility introduced by linker or chromophore rotation gives rise to conformational isomers with distinct atomic arrangements, complicating the interpretation of photophysical processes. In this study, we investigate 9,9&#8242;,10,10&#8242;&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bianthracene (TPBA) to elucidate the distinct electronic characteristics of its two primary rotational isomers: syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;TPBA. To address the &#8220;Janus&#8208;type&#8221; photophysical behavior of these isomers, we employed a comprehensive suite of static and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques, including excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, transient absorption, and time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance, complemented by theoretical calculations. syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;TPBA exhibit markedly different emissive properties and charge&#8208;transfer characteristics, reflecting their unique exciton coupling behaviors. Additionally, they showcase distinct triplet formation rates and exhibit environment&#8208;dependent triplet formation mechanisms. This in&#8208;depth study of the Janus&#8208;like electronic properties of TPBA underscores the critical role of conformational isomerism in organic molecular dimers. Neglecting these structural variations can obscure the true photophysical landscape and lead to misinterpretations of mechanistic processes, highlighting the necessity of considering conformational heterogeneity in molecular design and photophysical studies.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Molecular Wires for Membrane Potential Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully water&#8208;soluble fluorescent rosamine&#8208;based amphiphilic molecular wires were developed for imaging membrane potentials. The performance of the probes was evaluated in single cardiomyocytes, murine pituitary gland, and islets of Langerhans.








Abstract
Voltage&#8208;sensitive probes based on donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, whose fluorescence is modulated by photoinduced electron transfer (PET) in response to changes in membrane potential, are known as PET molecular wires. PET wires have been widely used in cultured cells; however, their applications in tissue&#8208;level imaging have been hampered by their inadequate aqueous solubility, necessitating pre&#8208;dissolution in organic solvents that potentially can cause toxic effects. Here we present the synthesis, electronic structure analysis, photophysical characterization, and initial demonstration of water&#8208;soluble amphiphilic molecular wires, consisting of a rosamine, as a fluorescent PET acceptor, and a PET donor consisting of a conjugated bridge terminated by dimethylaniline (DMA). The rosamine moiety is extended by several carboxylates or polyethylene glycol (PEG) groups, which render the probes highly water&#8208;soluble and facilitate labeling of phospholipid membranes, positioning molecules in proper orientation. The probes produced functional responses in electrically stimulated mouse cardiomyocytes and as well as in intact neurohypophysis, and in glucose&#8208;stimulated murine islets of Langerhans. The new molecular wires make up a useful addition to the toolkit of optical reporters for membrane potential imaging.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#949;&#8208;Lactams via Rh(I)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;C Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective synthesis of &#949;&#8208;lactams via Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#9472;C bond activation of non&#8208;activated aminocyclopropanes has been developed. This method not only represents an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy method for chiral &#949;&#8208;lactam synthesis via an enantioselective C&#9472;C bond activation process but also set up a new strategy for enantioselective transformation of dialkyl&#8208;substituted transition&#8208;metal intermediates.

&#949;&#8208;Lactams are important structural motifs in medicinal chemistry, but a fully enantioselective synthesis without byproduct formation represents a challenge that has attracted significant research interest. Herein, we report an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic synthesis of chiral &#949;&#8208;lactams via Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#9472;C bond activation of aminocyclopropanes. The catalytic C&#9472;C bond activation enables a directed generation of chiral rhodacyclobutanes that circumvents &#946;&#8208;hydride decomposition. Subsequent enantioselective cycloaddition of the alkene unit and then fragmentation generates chiral &#949;&#8208;lactams. A range of enantioenriched &#949;&#8208;lactams have been obtained with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities, which can undergo several stereospecific transformations. Theoretical calculations are performed to reveal the reaction mechanism and the origin of enantioselectivity control.

&lt;p&gt;The enantioselective synthesis of &#949;-lactams via Rh(I)-catalyzed asymmetric C&#9472;C bond activation of non-activated aminocyclopropanes has been developed. This method not only represents an atom- and step-economy method for chiral &#949;-lactam synthesis via an enantioselective C&#9472;C bond activation process but also set up a new strategy for enantioselective transformation of dialkyl-substituted transition-metal intermediates.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Perovskite Heterojunction Photocatalytic Membrane with Efficient Proton Supply for Boosting CO2 Methanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The H&#8208;bonded MPB/CN&#8208;g&#8208;CN/ECE photocatalytic membrane enhances CO2 methanation efficiency by enabling preferential hole oxidation of ECE (versus H2O) for proton supply, while its H&#8208;bond network accelerates proton transfer and strengthens *CO adsorption to boost CH4 production.








Abstract
Efficient proton supply and enhanced *CO intermediate adsorption are crucial strategies for boosting CO2 methanation. Herein, we construct a hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) photocatalytic membrane by integrating a MAPbBr3/cyano&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4 (MPB/CN&#8208;g&#8208;CN) heterojunction with ethyl cellulose (ECE) binder through a simple sol&#8211;gel process, achieving significantly enhanced CO2 methanation efficiency. ECE functions as a novel proton source, with hydroxyl (&#8208;OH) groups that are readily oxidized by photogenerated holes, resulting in efficient proton supply compared to H2O. Moreover, ECE facilitates membrane assembly via interfacial H&#8208;bonding between the &#8208;OH moieties of ECE and the modified nitrogen sites of MPB/CN&#8208;g&#8208;CN, generating proton&#8208;rich interfaces and local H&#8208;bond microenvironments that synergistically enhance proton supply and CO adsorption, thus steering the reaction toward CH4 production. As a result, the MPB/CN&#8208;g&#8208;CN membrane achieves a remarkable increase in CH4 yield from 0.01 to 35.85&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and selectivity from 0.4% to 82% compared to the pristine heterojunction. Furthermore, the MPB/CN&#8208;g&#8208;CN/ECE membrane demonstrates exceptional recyclability through a re&#8208;crosslinking membrane formation process, effectively reactivating proton&#8208;supply sites while maintaining superior CH4 selectivity across multiple operational cycles.

         <title>Bright Long&#8208;Wavelength Multi&#8208;State TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of bulky V&#8208;shaped donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor structure, alkyl chain engineering, and charge&#8208;transfer effect has been used to realize molecules with bright multi&#8208;state long&#8208;wavelength thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emission. This approach led to a rigid dispersed&#8208;state conformation and twisted aggregate&#8208;state conformation with high luminescence efficiency up to 75.90% and 53.50%, respectively.








Abstract
To achieve multi&#8208;state, visible&#8208;light&#8208;excited, long&#8208;wavelength thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with high emission efficiency within a single molecular dye system remains a significant challenge. Herein, we developed a series of V&#8208;shaped emitters comprising electron&#8208;deficient benzothiadiazole and electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine (TPA) or carbazole (Cz) units, featuring small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps. These molecules exhibit long&#8208;wavelength TADF emission and bright luminescence in both single&#8208;molecule and aggregate states. The V&#8208;shaped structure prompts multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonds, while the intramolecular charge transfer effect significantly relaxes the molecular conformation in the excited state. These synergistic effects result in a rigid excited&#8208;state molecular conformation, facilitating strong single&#8208;molecule state emission with a high luminescence efficiency up to 75.90% (delayed: 26.57%). Meanwhile, the unique V&#8208;shaped structure and long alkyl chains enable these luminophores to maintain a twisted conformation and staggered stacking in the aggregate state, effectively preventing aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effects. Furthermore, the regular crystal environment ensures that these molecules possess a bright aggregate&#8208;state TADF luminescence with a high quantum yield up to 53.50% (delayed: 11.23%). Benefiting from their excellent photophysical properties, these molecules were successfully applied as functional dyes for concentration&#8208;independent cell imaging and antibacterial treatment. This work paves the way for designing long&#8208;wavelength TADF materials with efficient multi&#8208;state emission.

         <title>Distinct Charge Transport and its Regulation in Single&#8208;Molecule and Monolayer Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208; and voltage&#8208;dependent transport mechanisms of single&#8208;molecule junctions and monolayer junctions are elucidated, highlighting the distinct influences of molecular vibrations and the orientation of the electric field on charge transport.








Abstract
As electronic devices miniaturize to the nanometer scale, molecular junctions, including single and monolayer molecules, are gaining attention for applications in logic, storage, and sensing. However, comparative studies of charge transport in these two junction types are limited. Here, a highly conjugated pyrene derivative has been engineered to construct both single&#8208;molecule and monolayer junctions. The charge transport within these junctions has been examined systematically through theoretical simulations and electrical measurements. These studies demonstrate a distinct transition in a single molecule from temperature&#8208;independent coherent tunneling to temperature&#8208;dependent incoherent transport, indicating vibration&#8208;mediated transport, while vibration&#8208;suppressed coherent transport is observed in a densely packed monolayer. Additionally, anisotropic gating experiments reveal that parallel fields relative to the molecular connection modulate energy levels more efficiently in comparison with perpendicular fields. These findings enrich our understanding of molecular electronic transport and pave the way for diverse developments in the field of molecular electronic devices.

         <title>Unraveling the Mode of Action of a Neuron&#8208;Specific Fluorescent Probe, NeuO: Intracellular Phosphorylation Through PAK6 Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NeuO, a small molecule fluorescent probe, selectively stains live neurons across species. Despite wide use and commercial availability, its neuron&#8208;specific mechanism has remained elusive. This work shows that NeuO is phosphorylated intracellularly by the kinase PAK6. This phosphorylation enhances fluorescence and probe accumulation in neurons.








Abstract
NeuO is an intriguing molecular probe capable of selectively labeling live neurons within a heterogeneous population of brain cells. The precise mechanism responsible for this neuronal labeling has remained a longstanding enigma. We investigated four potential mechanisms underlying NeuO's fluorescence, including its interaction with neuronal proteins, transportation into neurons, export from glial cells, and structural alterations within neurons. Our study found that NeuO undergoes structural changes via phosphorylation by the PAK6 kinase, resulting in high fluorescence in neurons, likely due to fluorogenic activation and intracellular retention within neurons. This discovery improves our understanding of the molecular mechanism of NeuO in neurons and facilitates the development of new chemical compounds that can be selectively modified by kinases in living cells.

This study confirms the role of O2 pre&#8208;adsorption on Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C SACs, a mechanism previously only predicted by theoretical calculations. The results show that the interaction between O2 molecules and pyridinic N vacancy defects shifts the d&#8208;band center of the central Fe atom away from the Fermi level, thereby facilitating the ORR kinetics.








Abstract
Defect structures within the carbon matrix play a crucial role in enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Fe single atom and nitrogen&#8208;doped catalysts (Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C SACs). However, overlooking the O2 pre&#8208;adsorption process induced by defective structures hampers the precise identification of active sites and the investigation of the reaction mechanism in Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C SACs. Hence, we report a Fe SAC with abundant pyridinic N vacancy defects in microporous structures (Fe&#8208;Nv&#8208;C SAC) and propose a synergistic effect between pyridinic N vacancy defects and O2 molecules that promotes the kinetics of ORR. The developed Fe&#8208;Nv&#8208;C SAC demonstrates exceptional ORR performance, exhibiting superior mass activity and turnover frequency compared to conventional Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C SACs. The in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and theoretical calculations indicate that pyridinic N vacancy defects in microporous structures facilitate pre&#8208;adsorption of O2 molecules results in the d&#8208;band centers of central Fe atoms shifting away from the fermi level. This shift weakens the adsorption strength of *OH species, thereby facilitating the kinetic process of ORR. This work addresses a critical gap in the field of electrocatalysis by providing the experimental validation of pre&#8208;adsorption of O2 molecules on Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts, a phenomenon previously only speculated through theoretical calculations.

         <title>Individual Virus Detection by Peptide&#8211;Gold Nanocluster&#8208;Assembled Artificial Binder</title>

Developing a peptide&#8211;gold nanocluster&#8208;assembled binder (PEGNAB) platform provides new opportunities for replacing antibodies in the diagnostic field. We demonstrated that PEGNAB, composed of gold nanoclusters and polymeric peptides, can densely bind to the surface of virions, leading to signal amplification. The universal nature of the PEGNAB model was demonstrated by the successful detection of a single influenza A virus.








Abstract
Ultrasensitive point&#8208;of&#8208;care detection is urgently required for viruses with high infectivity and lethality rates. In this study, we developed a direct detection platform, a peptide&#8211;gold nanocluster&#8208;assembled binder (PEGNAB), in which antigen&#8208;binding polymeric peptides are modified on a single gold nanocluster. This innovative platform has been applied to detect the influenza A virus (IAV), and it exhibits a high affinity for its spike protein, hemagglutinin, owing to its multisite binding mechanism. Approximately 500&#8211;800 PEGNAB particles were bound per virion, enabling individual virus detection through signal amplification. The linear detection range for IAV was 1&#8211;100&#160;copies per well. A PEGNAB&#8208;based IAV antigen assay kit and paper strip were developed, offering simple operation, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and ultra&#8208;high sensitivity. In a double&#8208;blind trial involving 130 throat swabs (80 positive and 50 negative specimens), the PEGNAB kit achieved 98.8% sensitivity and 96% specificity, and the PEGNAB strip achieved 97.5% sensitivity and 96% specificity, as validated against quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrate that different PEGNAB&#8208;based target binding modes can be readily adapted to various pathogens by altering the peptide sequence.

         <title>Engineering Intermolecular Packing Mode of Oxygen&#8208;Bridged Cyclized Boron&#8208;Based MR&#8208;TADF Emitters Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Deep&#8208;Blue Narrowband OLEDs</title>

         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;bridged cyclized boron&#8208;based multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters have been constructed by engineering the intermolecular packing, which has led to near&#8208;unity photoluminescence yields and excellent reverse intersystem crossing being achieved via intermolecular donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in the solid state. A record high external quantum efficiency of 31.75% has been achieved with deep&#8208;blue narrowband emission.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;cost multi resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters especially in the deep&#8208;blue region is critically limited due to intrinsic excimer quenching of planar &#960;&#8208;extended frameworks. Herein, a novel design strategy is reported for realizing high&#8208;efficiency oxygen&#8208;bridged cyclized boron&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters via engineering intermolecular packing mode. Three organic donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) molecules with different molecular configurations are designed and synthesized, which can readily form modulated packing patterns with fastidiously regulating intermolecular charge transfer (CT) in crystalline states. Experimental and theoretical investigations expose that the intermolecular D&#8211;A packing modes could be formed in relatively planar molecular architecture, which cannot only fix the intermolecular CT excited&#8208;state configuration, but the multiple conversion channels of triplet excitons can also be involved synergistically to accelerate the spin&#8208;flip, and thus achieving near&#8208;unity PLQY and excellent reverse intersystem crossing rate of 6.7&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1 in solid states. The optimized OLEDs devices achieve an attractive EQE value of 31.75%, which is at a record high for MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs with deep&#8208;blue emission. Our strategy boosts the luminescence efficiency of MR&#8208;TADF emitters through enabling the participation of multiple triplet states and the confined excited&#8208;state conformations induced by intermolecular CT interaction in aggregation state.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Design of Polymeric Semiconductor Nanomotors with Multichannel Sensitive 3D Motion for Microorganism Inactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of light&#8208;driven nanomotors based on polymeric semiconductor phenolic resins achieves precise 3D motion under multiwavelength light, guided by rational molecular design. The enhanced mobility and antimicrobial activity, originating from the high photocatalytic efficiency of phenolic resins, provide an innovative material platform for environmental and biomedical applications.








Abstract
The advancement of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts is crucial for the iteration of light&#8208;driven micro/nanomotors. However, most existing light&#8208;driven micro/nanomotors, which are typically fabricated from inorganic semiconductors, suffer from limited visible&#8208;light absorption and inadequate control over 3D motion. Polymeric semiconductors, as emerging photocatalytic materials, feature narrow bandgaps, tunable band structures, and the potential for rational molecular design to optimize activity. This study introduces phenolic resins as efficient semiconductor photocatalysts, establishing a novel platform for constructing light&#8208;driven nanomotors. Among them, the m&#8208;aminophenol&#8208;formaldehyde resin nanomotor, synthesized via hydrothermal methods, exhibits exceptional mobility due to its efficient photoelectric conversion and charge transfer behavior. Its outstanding photoelectrochemical properties originate from a benzoxazine&#8208;quinoid structure with a low HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (1.90&#160;eV). These nanomotors feature broad&#8208;spectrum light absorption and can respond to various external stimuli, including light intensity, wavelength, and H2O2 concentration, enabling precise control over in&#8208;plane and vertical motion with adjustable speed and directionality. As a proof of concept, the nanomotors demonstrate superior photodynamic inactivation of Karenia mikimotoi under visible light exposure, surpassing TiO2 nanoparticles in antimicrobial efficiency. This work explores the relationship between molecular structure, photocatalytic performance, and motion behavior, providing instructive insights for designing light&#8208;driven nanomotors with advanced motion manipulation.

Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) coordination enhanced dual&#8208;functional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for both Zn&#8208;ion storage and deposition control in aqueous batteries.








Abstract
In response to the increasing demand for sustainable energy storage solutions, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered significant attention for their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, two major challenges to battery stability persist: developing efficient cathode materials and addressing zinc dendrite formation. Here, we report a dual&#8208;functional covalent organic framework (COF), named Ni&#8211;DAPTO, designed to improve both Zn2+ storage on the cathode and zinc deposition kinetics on the anode. The incorporation of Ni coordination centers achieves an expected low energy gap, enhancing the intrinsic conductivity, while selectively guiding uniform Zn2+ deposition. As a result, the Ni&#8211;DAPTO cathode demonstrated superior cycling stability and rate performance, retaining a specific capacity of 127.0 and 119.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 and 10.0 A g&#8722;1, respectively after 10&#160;000 cycles. Besides, when employed as artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), Ni&#8211;DAPTO can improve zinc utilization and inhibit dendrite formation. The full AZIBs assembled with Ni&#8211;DAPTO cathodes and Ni&#8211;DAPTO modified Zn anodes deliver a discharge capacity of 100.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 5.0 A g&#8722;1. These findings suggest that multifunctional COFs hold great potential for advancing high&#8208;performance and long&#8208;lasting aqueous secondary batteries.

&lt;p&gt;In response to the increasing demand for sustainable energy storage solutions, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered significant attention for their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, two major challenges to battery stability persist: developing efficient cathode materials and addressing zinc dendrite formation. Here, we report a dual-functional covalent organic framework (COF), named Ni&#8211;DAPTO, designed to improve both Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; storage on the cathode and zinc deposition kinetics on the anode. The incorporation of Ni coordination centers achieves an expected low energy gap, enhancing the intrinsic conductivity, while selectively guiding uniform Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition. As a result, the Ni&#8211;DAPTO cathode demonstrated superior cycling stability and rate performance, retaining a specific capacity of 127.0 and 119.7 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5 and 10.0 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively after 10&#160;000 cycles. Besides, when employed as artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), Ni&#8211;DAPTO can improve zinc utilization and inhibit dendrite formation. The full AZIBs assembled with Ni&#8211;DAPTO cathodes and Ni&#8211;DAPTO modified Zn anodes deliver a discharge capacity of 100.9 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000 cycles at a current density of 5.0 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. These findings suggest that multifunctional COFs hold great potential for advancing high-performance and long-lasting aqueous secondary batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bridging Donor Ligands Enable an Ultrastable Graphite Anode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium dicyandiamide (NaDCA) is taken as a bridging&#8208;donor&#8208;ligand model to expand graphite interlayers and construct ligand channels that stabilize Na&#8314;&#8208;solvent structures. It mitigates volume changes and boosts energy density. The graphite anode achieved a cycle life exceeding 5000 cycles (over 8 months) with 94% retention, and the capacity release of the NVP||graphite full cell was increased by 33%.








Abstract
Graphite is widely utilized as an anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its abundance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and excellent structural stability during lithium intercalation and deintercalation, which contribute to a long cycle life. However, graphite is not inherently suitable for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to the limited intercalation properties of sodium ions. To address this, we propose the concept of bridging&#8208;donor&#8208;ligands, which construct ligand channels and consistently expand the graphite interlayer spacing. Using sodium dicyandiamide (NaDCA) as a model ligand, we demonstrate the formation of abundant ligand channels facilitated by the versatile dicyanamide anion (DCA&#8722;), significantly enhancing the structural robustness of ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t&#8208;GICs). Hence, the graphite anode capacity retention is over 94% after 5000 cycles, with an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) exceeding 99.8% in SIBs. This mechanism is versatile and can be extended to other metal&#8208;ion battery electrolytes.

Abstract
We reported a metal&#8208;free ethynylsulfone&#8208;based phenol&#8208;yne click polymerization for the efficient synthesis of stereoregulated poly(&#946;&#8208;aryloxylvinylsulfone)s (PAVSs), a new class of polymers exhibiting inherent responsiveness to multiple stimuli. This polymerization exhibits superior reactivity, yielding high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers whose stereochemistry (Z/E configuration) can be precisely modulated by catalysts, monomer concentration, and solvents. The resulting Z&#8208; and E&#8208;enriched PAVSs demonstrate distinct thermal and mechanical properties, highlighting the impact of stereochemical control on material performance. Furthermore, new stimulus&#8208;induced transformations have been developed on the PAVS platform. A catalyst&#8208;free amine exchange reaction enables both precise polymer degradation and direct polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer conversion under mild conditions. Moreover, an unprecedented C&#9552;C bond cleavage reaction between PAVSs and N,N'&#8208;diethylethylenediamine affords methylated products, representing a rare example of alkene bond scission via simple diamine treatment. A photoinduced rearrangement reaction has also been established, leading to significant fluorescence enhancement upon UV irradiation. This photochemical behavior underpins potential applications in secure information encoding and encrypted communication.

         <title>Quantum Chemistry Calculation&#8208;Assisted Large&#8208;Scale Collision Cross Section Prediction Empowers Derivatization&#8208;Enhanced Multidimensional Metabolomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurately predicting the large&#8208;scale properties of derivatized metabolites without relying on standards is a major challenge. We propose a quantum chemistry calculation&#8208;assisted strategy applicable to the accurate prediction of the collision cross section of derivatized metabolites, enabling high&#8208;coverage multidimensional isomer&#8208;level sterolomics that quantitatively revealed the tissue&#8208;specific distribution patterns of sterol lipids.








Abstract
Derivatization&#8208;enhanced multidimensional metabolomics combined with ion mobility mass spectrometry will greatly improve the accuracy and coverage of metabolic analysis. However, accurate prediction of the large&#8208;scale collision cross section (CCS) of derivatized metabolites without relying on standards and the establishment of multidimensional analytical methods faces great challenges. Here, we propose quantum chemistry calculation&#8208;assisted machine learning strategies applicable to the accurate prediction of the CCS of derivatized sterols, develop C&#9552;C bond&#8208;targeted N&#8208;Me derivatization methods for unsaturated sterols, and create a large&#8208;scale, 4D information database of derivatized sterol lipids (n&#160;=&#160;4891) by combining retention time and fragment ion prediction. Furthermore, a high&#8208;coverage unsaturated sterolomics at the isomer level was established on this basis, which quantitatively revealed the tissue&#8208;specific distribution patterns of over 100 sterol lipids. This study provides a key foundation for derivatization&#8208;enhanced metabolomics and provides important techniques and information for metabolic and functional studies of sterols.

         <title>Multiresonant Framework&#8208;Perturbed Platinum(II) Complexes Enable Efficient Narrowband Red Phosphorescence Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for designing efficient narrowband red phosphorescent emitters is presented by orthogonal integration of boron&#8211;nitrogen multiple resonance (BN&#8208;MR) frameworks into tetradentate Pt(II) complexes. Theoretical calculations reveal that the BN&#8208;MR skeleton electronically perturbs the singlet excited state, thereby enhancing transition dipole moments and accelerating radiative decay rates.








Abstract
While considerable research efforts have been devoted to developing narrowband B,N&#8208;embedded multiple resonance (BN&#8208;MR) emitters, despite the formidable challenge, the design of efficient narrowband red phosphors has been overlooked. Herein, we present a design strategy that perpendicularly integrates BN&#8208;MR frameworks into a weakly emissive tetradentate Pt(II) complex to achieve efficient narrowband phosphors. Accordingly, we synthesized two novel emitters, BCzBN&#8208;PyPt and DPABN&#8208;PyPt. The optimized emitter BCzBN&#8208;PyPt exhibits exceptional performance characteristics: 1) narrowband red emission at 605&#160;nm with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 35&#160;nm/0.118&#160;eV in toluene, 2) a dramatically shortened exciton lifetime of 1.2&#160;&#181;s (compared to 7.6&#160;&#181;s for the parent complex PhPyPt), and 3) a remarkable photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL) of 75% in doped films&#8211;representing a 4.4&#8208;fold enhancement over PhPyPt (&#934;PL&#160;=&#160;17%). Theoretical investigations reveal that the BN&#8208;MR skeleton induces significant electronic perturbation of the singlet state, leading to enhanced transition dipole moments and accelerated radiative decay (kr&#160;=&#160;3.3&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;s&#8722;1 versus 0.1&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;s&#8722;1 for PhPyPt). In optimized OLED devices, BCzBN&#8208;PyPt achieves superior red narrowband electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.7%.

         <title>Single&#8208;Site Metal&#8208;Nonmetal Microenvironment Regulation of Copper Nanoclusters with Atomic Precision for X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regulation of the single&#8208;site metal&#8208;nonmetal microenvironment was achieved using two structurally similar copper nanoclusters, offering insights into the development of high&#8208;performance cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials with controlled photoluminescence and radioluminescence for downstream applications. 








Abstract
The intramolecular microenvironment regulation in metal nanoclusters has typically occurred with the same attribute factors&#8212;like metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal or ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand control&#8212;while the regulation with different&#8208;attribute factors, e.g., from metal to nonmetal, remains challenging, not to mention the different&#8208;attribute microenvironment regulation at the single&#8208;site level. Herein, we report the single&#8208;site metal&#8208;nonmetal microenvironment regulation of copper nanoclusters based on structurally comparable Cu10 and Cu11 nanoclusters with the same skeleton but different vacancy&#8208;filling elements. The quantum&#8208;size effects endow Cu10 and Cu11 with distinctly different photophysical properties in terms of their photoluminescence and radioluminescence. Such differences have been rationalized by exploiting the femtosecond transient absorption analysis, demonstrating that the slower non&#8208;radiative decay rate and weaker electron&#8208;phonon coupling contribute to the superior emission characteristics of the Cu11 cluster. Accordingly, the Cu11&#8208;based film demonstrated effective X&#8208;ray imaging capabilities, marking the first application of cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials for X&#8208;ray imaging in the infrared region. This research highlights the potential for regulating different&#8208;attribute microenvironments in metal nanoclusters and provides an atomic&#8208;level understanding of how to modulate the photophysical properties of cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials.

         <title>A Robust Nickel&#8208;Interlocked &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework Catalyst for Photocatalytic Aromatic Finkelstein and Retro&#8208;Finkelstein Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni@COF1&#8208;Catalyzed Finkelstein and retro&#8208;Finkelstein reactions are reported! Comparative studies reveal that a nickel&#8208;functiontionalized olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (Ni@COF1) outperforms its reduced analog (Ni@COF1R) in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven halide exchange reactions. This robust catalyst exhibits high efficiency and broad functional group compatibility and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization of diverse drug scaffolds. 








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as a versatile class of hosts for heterogeneous photocatalysis. Herein, we present a nickel&#8208;decorated pyrene&#8208; and bipyridine&#8208;based olefin&#8208;linked COF (Ni@COF1) as a robust and recyclable catalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven aromatic Finkelstein and retro&#8208;Finkelstein reactions. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation within the COF framework enhances light absorption, promotes charge transport, and facilitates in situ Ni(0) generation from the pre&#8208;installed Ni(II) centers. Compared to its reduced counterpart (Ni@COF1R), Ni@COF1 exhibits remarkable catalytic performance. The methodology enables selective halide exchange, broad functional group compatibility, and late&#8208;stage diversification of eight bioactive molecules and nine pharmaceutical motifs. Furthermore, a gram&#8208;scale reaction with batch and continuous flow conditions underscores its scalability and synthetic utility. The catalyst is robust and recycled five times without any loss of catalytic activity, reaching a total turnover number &gt;850. These results highlight the significance of olefin&#8208;linked COFs in advancing sustainable photocatalysis and expanding their role in fine chemical synthesis.

         <title>Design of Aminophosphine Precursor for Robust Synthesis of InP Quantum Dots with Near&#8208;unity Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylsiylamine&#8208;based aminophosphine precursor was newly introduced to synthesize InP quantum dots (QDs). This new aminophosphine showed a faster reaction process compared to the conventional aminophosphine, resulting in the near&#8208;unity quantum yield (QY) and a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 48&#160;nm without additional purification.








Abstract
Aminophosphines have emerged as promising phosphorus candidates for the synthesis of InP quantum dots (QDs), offering an alternative to traditional tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphine. However, the relatively low reactivity of conventional aminophosphines has led to broader size distribution, resulting in higher full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FHWM) with lower photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we introduce a new aminosphosphine, bis(bis(trimethylsilyl)amino) phosphine (P[N(SiMe3)2]2H), to address this issue. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we demonstrate the direct nucleophilic activation of the P[N(SiMe3)2]2H with InCl3, leading to the rapid nucleation of InP QDs at a relatively lower synthesis temperature. This enabled to achieve InP/ZnSeS/ZnS QDs with near&#8208;unity PLQY and a FWHM of 48&#160;nm. These findings suggest a new chemistry for the synthesis of InP QDs, and could be extended to other III&#8208;V QDs for advanced optoelectronic applications.

         <title>3D Covalent Arsenic Polyoxomolybdate&#8208;Organic Polymer with Ultrahigh Photocatalytic Oxidative Ability for Aromatic C&#9472;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 3D covalent &#949;&#8208;Keggin&#8208;type arsenic polyoxomolybdate (AsPOM)&#8208;organic polymer (POF&#8208;2) is successfully synthesized by strategically balancing the solubility of (p&#8208;H3NC6H4As)4Mo12O46 (AsPOM) with 1,4&#8208;bi(3&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;oxoprop&#8208;2&#8208;enyl)benzene (BDOEB) organic linkers. POF&#8208;2 effectively integrates the strong oxidative ability of polyoxometalates (POMs) and the O2 activation ability of covalent organic polymers, exhibiting an ultrahigh photocatalytic oxidative activity for the efficient activation of aromatic C&#9472;H bonds.








Abstract
The photocatalytic activation of inert aromatic C&#9472;H bonds under mild conditions remains a major challenge due to the inherent stability of sp2 C&#9472;H bonds and the lack of efficient, selective heterogeneous photocatalysts. Herein, by strategically balancing the solubility of aniline&#8208;functionalized arsenic polyoxomolybdate (AsPOM) with the organic linker of 1,4&#8208;bi(3&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;oxoprop&#8208;2&#8208;enyl)benzene (BDOEB), a new 3D covalent AsPOM&#8208;organic polymer, termed POF&#8208;2, was successfully prepared. Its short&#8208; to medium&#8208;range ordered structure was resolved using the advanced total scattering atomic pair distribution function (PDF). The unique architecture of POF&#8208;2 synergistically combines the strong oxidative capability of AsPOM with the tunable light absorption and oxygen activation ability of organic monomers, narrowing the bandgap from 3.13&#160;eV (AsPOM) to 2.28&#160;eV (POF&#8208;2) and extending light absorption to 575&#160;nm. Under ambient conditions with low&#8208;energy visible&#8208;light irradiation (10&#160;W LED), POF&#8208;2 exhibits exceptional photocatalytic performance in aromatic C&#9472;H bromination and [3+2] cycloaddition reactions, achieving&#160;&gt;99% conversion and&#160;&gt;99% selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the well&#8208;defined donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structure of POF&#8208;2 facilitates rapid hole (h+)&#8208;mediated C&#9472;H activation on AsPOM nodes and selective 1O2 generation on BDOEB linkers, avoiding nonproductive substrate mineralization. This work not only demonstrates a new 3D covalent AsPOM&#8208;organic polymer for C&#9472;H functionalization but also provides a blueprint for designing molecularly precise, multifunctional photocatalysts for sustainable organic synthesis.

         <title>Simultaneous Modulation of Mesoporosity and Al Siting for Superior Performance Zeolite Catalyst in Ethylene Dehydroaromatization to Aromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy enables the construction of hierarchical zeolites with selective removal of &#8764;60% of channel&#8208;located Al, revealing that Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) at channel intersections exhibit a TOF of 516 h&#8722;1, 13 times higher than those within the channels. This leads to a 1.8&#8208;fold increase in ethylene conversion turnover frequency (TOF), enhanced aromatic selectivity, and superior stability at 973 K.








Abstract
Porosity and Al siting are key levers for optimizing zeolite catalysts, yet they are often addressed independently due to the lack of effective integrated tuning strategies. Herein, we report an integrative methodology for preparing hierarchical zeolite (ZF) with interconnected mesostructures and tunable Al siting, achieved via regioselective dissolution of Al&#8208;rich domains by presetting accessible and inaccessible zones within parent zeolite (ZP). Remarkably, &#8764;60% of the framework channels&#8217; Al atoms were selectively removed without impairing the channel intersections&#8217; Al atoms. Despite a 39% reduction in Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS), ZF exhibits a 1.8&#8208;fold higher turnover frequency (TOF) than ZP during ethylene transformation at 973K, attributable to the introduction of mesoporosity. Notably, site&#8208;specific 31P NMR analysis reveals that BAS located at channel intersections exhibits a TOF of 516 h&#8722;1, which is 13 times higher than that of sites within the channels (40 h&#8722;1). The hierarchical zeolite also demonstrates superior durability and enhanced aromatic selectivity compared to ZP. These results highlight the synergistic benefits of simultaneously tuning porosity and Al siting, offering a new paradigm for the rational design of high&#8208;performance zeolite catalysts and providing deeper insights into the interplay between structure and function in zeolite&#8208;based catalysis.

         <title>Designing Molecular Reactor of Interlayer Dual&#8208;Atom Toward Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conjugated molecular reactors (CuPPc), featuring interlayer diatomic Cu&#8208;N4 sites with tunable spacings (4.0&#8211;5.7&#160;&#197;), is designed for electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling from CO2 and nitrate. CuPPc&#8208;4.0 with optimal 4.0&#160;&#197; spacing, spatially matching urea's molecular dimensions (3.5&#160;&#197;), achieves a record urea yield rate, while the layered AA stacking structure stabilizes unbonded diatomic Cu configurations, ensuring electrocatalytic durability.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling offers a sustainable alternative to energy&#8208;intensive industrial processes for urea synthesis. Herein, we design conjugated polymer&#8208;based molecular reactors featuring interlayer diatomic Cu&#8211;N4 sites and precisely tunable spacings (4.0, 4.6, and 5.7&#160;&#197;) to optimize CO2 and nitrate coupling. The 4.0&#160;&#197;&#8208;spaced copper polyphthalocyanine (CuPPc&#8208;4.0) delivers a remarkable urea yield rate of 460.0&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1 with 26.1% Faradaic efficiency at &#8722;1.3&#160;V (versus RHE), outperforming wider&#8208;spaced analogs. The optimal 4.0&#160;&#197; cavity spatially confines reactants and intermediates, matching urea's molecular dimensions (3.5&#160;&#197;), thereby enhancing C&#8211;N coupling and urea synthesis activity, while the layered AA stacking structure stabilizes unbonded diatomic Cu configurations, preventing aggregation and ensuring durability. Mechanistic studies reveal that while ball&#8208;milling treatment increases single&#8208;atom exposure, it disrupts the layered architecture and eliminates interlayer diatomic sites, reducing activity by about 50%. This work demonstrates a multidimensional catalyst design integrating atomic precision and molecular confinement for sustainable electrosynthesis.

         <title>Engineering Peripheral Metal&#8208;Oxide Catalysis: Interparticle Spacing in Cu/ZrO2 Catalysts for Methanol Synthesis by CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytically active periphery around oxide&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles is key in reactions featuring marked metal&#8208;oxide promotional effects. For Cu/ZrO2 CO2 hydrogenation catalysts, a Cu interparticle spacing of &#8764;15&#160;nm optimizes methanol production rate and selectivity. This spacing maximizes the surface density of formate intermediates on peripheral ZrO2 which are dynamically turned over, marking a shift in the reaction's kinetic control.








Abstract
The periphery surrounding oxide&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles plays a crucial role in many catalytic reactions that exhibit strong metal&#8208;oxide promotional effects. Engineering this catalytically active periphery, where kinetically relevant surface intermediates are efficiently turned over, offers a pathway to optimized performance, yet it remains challenging due to the need for precise control over nanospatial catalyst features. Herein, we address this subject for the relevant case of methanol synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation on Cu/ZrO2 catalysts. The methanol synthesis rate reaches a maximum at a surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface Cu interparticle distance of ca. 15&#160;nm. Operando modulation&#8211;excitation diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy reveals that this optimal spacing maximizes the fraction of surface&#8208;bound HCOO* intermediates, stabilized on coordinatively unsaturated Zr(IV) Lewis acid sites on the ZrO2 support, which are dynamically involved in catalysis. This particle spacing represents a shift in the reaction's kinetic control regime and the apparent activation energy for methanol synthesis. Engineering Cu interparticle spacing to the optimal value results in exceptionally high metal&#8208;specific methanol formation rates under industrially relevant reaction conditions. More broadly, our findings highlight that, beyond metal particle size, interparticle spacing is a key design parameter for catalyst systems featuring functional metal&#8208;oxide interfaces.

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Confined Covalent&#8208;Organic Framework Pores as Nanoreactors for CO2 Photoconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquid&#8208;confined triazine&#8208;COF nanopores in the Z&#8208;scheme COF/BiVO4 nanocomposites serve as efficient nanoreactors for solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Its excellent performances stem from the Z&#8208;scheme promoted charge&#8208;separation for increasing electron density in the nanoreactor. Moreover, the nanoconfinement effects enable directed interfacial electron transfer, and enhanced CO2 capture/activation through in situ ionic liquid redistribution.








Abstract
The topological nanopores of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) show promise as spatially confined nanoreactors for solar CO2 photoconversion. However, simultaneously increasing the electron density, improving the electron transfer, CO2 capture, and catalytic efficiency within nanopores remains a challenge for optimizing the performance of such nanoreactors. Here, micro&#8208; and mesoporous triazine&#8208;COFs were in situ grown on amino&#8208;modified BiVO4 nanosheets (BVO), respectively, obtaining two&#8208;dimensional heterojunctions. A highly active ionic liquid (IL) 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIM][NTf2]) was subsequently confined within COF nanopores. Adopting IL&#8208;confined COF mesopore&#8208;nanoreactors, the best nanocomposite enables a 38&#8208;fold photoactivity enhancement compared to BVO and 100% selectivity towards CO and CH4 in pure water under UV&#8208;vis light irradiation, resulting in the record apparent quantum yield of 12.7% in visible region. Such performance is due to increased electron density inside mesopores via Z&#8208;scheme charge separation between BVO and COF, and the nanoconfinement effects of mesopores for IL, leading to i) facilitated directed electron transfer from COF to IL via multi&#8208;hydrogen bonds between the triazine acceptors and [EMIM]+ cations, ii) promoted CO2 capture by redistribution of IL ions, and iii) easy activation of CO2 molecules owing to shortened distance to adjacent [EMIM]+ cations as catalytic sites and reduced relative orientation angle.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Electrochemical Reconstruction of Copper Single&#8208;Sites to Dual&#8208;Sites for Ambient Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated copper single&#8208;atom catalyst was found to occur in situ electrochemical reconstruction from Cu&#8211;N3 single&#8208;sites to N2&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;N2 dual&#8208;sites during ambient electrosynthesis of urea. The in&#8208;situ electrochemically formed N2&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;N2 dual&#8208;sites as catalytic active centers efficiently enhanced the generation of *CO and *NH intermediates and the formation of *CONH, thus facilitating C&#8211;N coupling to urea.








Abstract
Understanding and uncovering really catalytic active&#8208;sites during electrocatalysis is vital for carbon&#8211;nitrogen coupling reaction to synthesize urea. Here, we report a Copper (Cu) single&#8208;atom catalyst (Cu&#8208;N3 SAs) with a Cu&#8211;N3 coordination structure for the electrochemical coreduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722; into urea. The in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that the Cu&#8211;N3 configured single&#8208;sites undergo electrochemically structural reconstruction to form N2&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;N2 dual&#8208;sites in Cu&#8211;N3 SAs, exhibiting efficient urea synthesis performance. The in&#8208;situ spectroscopy combined with mass spectrometry confirms that the initial C&#8211;N coupling reaction involves the formation of *CONH from *CO and *NH intermediates generated via the coreduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722; on the N2&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;N2 dual&#8208;sites. The in&#8208;situ electrochemical formed Cu dual&#8208;sites not only enhance the adsorption of *CO, but also facilitates the multi&#8208;electron transfer processes with lowered energy barrier for the formation of *CONH intermediates.

         <title>Ionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks: A New Type of Porous Organic Solid Base</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid bases are important reagents widely used in both fundamental research and industry applications. Here, we developed a new type of porous organic solid base via self&#8208;assembly of deprotonated monomers. The basicity was confirmed by in situ DRIFTS and measured by titration, while the proton&#8208;induced structural transformation was clearly revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The abundant basic sites and inherent porosity make solid bases as a new type of catalysts with excellent catalytic activity.








Abstract
Solid base offers advantages in terms of the ease of handling, environmentally sustainable processes, and tunable interfacial properties. Despite of these benefits, the exploration of new solid bases remains challenging and is an underdeveloped area of research. In this work, we report the discovery of the inherent basicity of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). The high crystallinity of HOFs enables us to monitor the precise structure changes and proton transfer process during acid&#8208;base neutralization reaction through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. With this information, the origin of basicity and the underlying mechanism can be identified, which further guide us to discover other porous solid bases and unveil the universal characteristic of some anionic HOFs. The practical use of the porous solid bases was demonstrated by base&#8208;catalyzed reactions, exhibiting high activity and selectivity. This study enriches the solid&#8208;base family by introducing a type of materials featured with high porosity, high crystallinity, and modular structure.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Formal C&#9472;H/C&#9472;H Coupling of Arylacetamides and Sulfoxides: An Interrupted Pummerer/[2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic Rearrangement Sequence</title>

         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step formal C&#9472;H/C&#9472;H coupling of arylacetamides with sulfoxides proceeds via the formation and rearrangement of little&#8208;known &#945;&#8208;amido sulfonium salts and provides an alternative to transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation. The protocol is showcased in a short synthesis of a dopamine D1 receptor allosteric modulator.








Abstract
Arylacetamides are important structural motifs found in many bioactive compound classes. Given their significance, the selective decoration of arylacetamides by transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation has attracted considerable attention. Here, we report a two&#8208;step transition metal&#8208;free formal C&#9472;H/C&#9472;H coupling of arylacetamides with sulfoxides that proceeds via the formation and rearrangement of little&#8208;known &#945;&#8208;amido sulfonium salts; the amide motif &#8220;catches&#8221; the sulfoxide partner prior to its delivery to the ortho&#8208;position of the aromatic ring by rearrangement of a sulfur ylide intermediate. The approach delivers alkylated arylacetamides bearing sulfide functional handles that can be exploited in downstream manipulations. This protocol has allowed the synthesis of a dopamine D1 receptor allosteric modulator without recourse to the use of transition metals.

         <title>Ketenimine Multicomponent Strategy for Multifaceted Amidine Functionalization of Peptides on the Solid Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent strategy compatible with solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis leverages ketenimines for the direct installation of &#948;/&#949;&#8208;amidine motifs into peptides. This method unlocks a range of on&#8208;resin transformations, including side chain editing, macrocyclization, drug/fluorophore/functional&#8208;scaffold conjugation, and aromatic group insertion, streamlining access to functionally enhanced peptide architectures.








Abstract
The amidine group and its derivatives serve as proteolytically stable bioisosteres of the peptide bond, and their selective incorporation into peptides attributes significant chemical and biological features. This study introduces an efficient synthesis of amidine&#8208;containing peptides by a copper&#8208;catalyzed, solid&#8208;phase&#8208;compatible multicomponent reaction (MCR), leveraging ketenimine intermediates that are generated in situ. Through the reaction of sulfonyl azides with terminal alkynes and a wide variety of amines, we establish the robust on&#8208;resin synthesis of &#948;/&#949;&#8208;amidine amino acids, arginine isologues, fluorescently labeled peptides, drug&#8208;peptide hybrids, and PEGylated derivatives. This strategy notably supports a wide range of peptide modifications, including side chain alteration, amine functionalization, and peptide macrocyclization through both backbone and side chain groups, as well as incorporating aromatic scaffolds into the peptide backbone. The methodology demonstrates broad substrate tolerance, compatibility with peptide chemistry protocols, and access to complex motifs, including pharmacophores and imaging tags, all within a single reaction platform. Our results underscore the synthetic versatility and functional applicability of ketenimine&#8208;based MCRs for advanced peptide modification, expanding the chemical space of peptide medicinal chemistry and therapeutics.

         <title>Structural Insights Into Phase Formation of Sodium Layered Cathodes Materials with Prominent Electrochemical Performances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we found that O vacancies play a critical role in governing the P&#8242;2&#8211;P2 phase transition during the synthesis process of sodium layered cathode materials. These structural insights broaden synthesis strategies and enhance practical feasibility. As a result of the expanded Mn redox range and the stabilization of oxygen vacancies during electrochemical cycling, the synthesized P&#8242;2&#8208;Na0.67Fe0.05Ti0.1Mn0.85O2 demonstrates prominent electrochemical performance.








Abstract
The electrochemical performances of layered cathodes&#160;for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are intimately dependent on their structural characteristics. However, realizing accurate regulation of structure by phase engineering is challenging, primarily due to constrained synthesis methods and the existing gaps in understanding of specialized phase structures. Herein, a series of P&#8242;2&#8208;Na0.67Fe0.05Ti0.1Mn0.85O2 cathode material with prominent electrochemical performances were successfully synthesized, based on an in&#8208;depth understanding of structural insights into P&#8242;2 phase.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, we found that O vacancies play a critical role in governing the P&#8242;2&#8211;P2 phase transition during the synthesis process of sodium layered cathode materials. These structural insights broaden synthesis strategies and enhance practical feasibility. As a result of the expanded Mn redox range and the stabilization of oxygen vacancies during electrochemical cycling, the synthesized P&#8242;2-Na&lt;sub&gt;0.67&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.85&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrates prominent electrochemical performance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical performances of layered cathodes&#160;for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are intimately dependent on their structural characteristics. However, realizing accurate regulation of structure by phase engineering is challenging, primarily due to constrained synthesis methods and the existing gaps in understanding of specialized phase structures. Herein, a series of P&#8242;2-Na&lt;sub&gt;0.67&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.85&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode material with prominent electrochemical performances were successfully synthesized, based on an in-depth understanding of structural insights into P&#8242;2 phase. By analyzing the structural evolution and Mn-valence changes during synthesis, we found that oxygen vacancies play a significant role in determining the P&#8242;2&#8211;P2 phase transition. Moreover, these insights not only identified the oxygen release and uptake behaviors in phase formation but also expanded synthesis strategy with enhanced operational feasibility. Benefits from expanded Mn redox range and stable oxygen vacancies during cycling, the obtained P&#8242;2-Na&lt;sub&gt;0.67&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.85&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrated a capacity increase of over &#8764;40&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#160;C, maintaining &#8764;93&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; even after 1000 cycles at 10&#160;C, with an impressive retention rate of 87.5%.

         <title>Molecular Rotors as Reactivity Probes: Predicting Electrophilicity from the Speed of Rotation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new empirical parameter, ERB, quantifies electrophilicity from rotational barriers of N&#8208;phenylimide molecular rotors. ERB predicts reactivity trends in Michael additions, SN2, SNAr, Pd&#8208;oxidative addition, and Sonogashira reactions by capturing both attractive and repulsive transition state interactions.








Abstract
A new empirical electrophilicity reactivity parameter, ERB, was developed based on the rotational barriers of a series of N&#8208;phenylimide molecular rotors containing various electrophilic groups. In the bond rotation transition state, these electrophilic groups form close contact with an electronegative C&#9552;O oxygen. Thus, strong electrophilic groups significantly lowered the rotational barrier. As a result, the rotational barriers were inversely correlated with the strengths of the electrophiles. The rotational barriers were measured by dynamic NMR (EXSY), enabling the quantification across a wide range of types of electrophiles. Computational analysis confirmed that the observed variations arose from intramolecular interactions in the transition state, where the C&#9552;O oxygen served as a probe of both the electrophilic group's electrostatic potential and steric accessibility. By simultaneously capturing attractive and repulsive transition state interactions, ERB provides an effective means of predicting electrophilicity and reactivity trends across a broad range of electrophiles and reaction types. The utility of ERB was initially validated using a series of rotors containing Michael addition electrophiles, followed by broader application to a diverse array of reactions involving sp3 and sp2 electrophiles, including SN2, SNAr, Pd&#8208;oxidative addition, and Sonogashira reactions.

         <title>A Weakly&#8208;Solvating Propylene Carbonate Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage and Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, we embark on a systematic exploration of the influence exerted by difluoroethylene carbonate (DFEC) in Li+&#8208;PC interactions, which profoundly alters the compatibility of PC with graphite, allowing the practicality of PC&#8208;based electrolyte. Building on this, the pouch cells achieve extended cycling stability at high voltage and improved low&#8208;temperature capacity retention while elucidating the underlying mechanisms.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) require electrolytes compatible with high&#8208;voltage (&gt;4.3&#160;V) and low&#8208;temperature (&lt;&#8722;10&#160;&#176;C) operation, yet commercial ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;based systems remain constrained by intrinsic limitations including poor oxidation stability at cathode side and high melting points. Although propylene carbonate (PC) demonstrates superior oxidative stability and lower melting temperature than EC, its tendency to cointercalate with Li+ within the graphite anode interlayers restricts its applicability in LIBs. We propose a PC&#8208;based weakly&#8208;solvating electrolyte engineered with difluoroethylene carbonate (DFEC) that resolves interfacial challenges at both electrodes. The PC solvent facilitates oxidative resistance through formation of an inorganic&#8208;dominated cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI), effectively mitigating transition metal dissolution at 4.4&#160;V operation. Simultaneously, DFEC disrupts Li+&#8208;PC coordination through reduced solvent molecule numbers in the solvation shell, enabling generation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite anodes with minimized interfacial impedance. Implemented in 5 Ah pouch cells, this electrolyte demonstrates 76.7% capacity retention after 2000 cycles (2.8&#8211;4.4&#160;V) at room temperature (RT) and maintains 91% of its RT capacity at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, surpassing conventional EC&#8208;based electrolytes. This work presents an electrolyte engineering approach that synergistically addresses high&#8208;voltage durability and low&#8208;temperature functionality, providing a scalable solution for advanced LIB technologies.

         <dc:description>
Twisted intramolecular charge transfer luminogens (TICTgens) were designed for precisely regulating and in&#8208;situ monitoring of tumor cell pyroptosis in vitro and in vivo. The outperformed TICTgen HCM displayed NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic response to viscosity with superior sensitivity. Furthermore, HCM could generate dual type&#8208;I/II photodynamic and photothermal effects upon laser irradiation, which selectively induced mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent pyroptosis. In combination with acidity&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles, a versatile theragnostic platform for precise pyroptosis induction and in&#8208;situ evaluation of cancer immunotherapy was developed.








Abstract
Pyroptosis has emerged as a promising mechanism for eliciting robust antitumor immunity; however, the current pyroptosis inducers lack tumor&#8208;selectivity and feedback of therapeutic effect. In this study, we developed a series of twisted intramolecular charge transfer luminogens (TICTgens) for precisely regulating and in situ monitoring of tumor cell pyroptosis in vitro and in vivo. The outperformed TICTgen HCM displayed second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence emission and exceptional viscosity sensitivity. Upon 671&#160;nm laser irradiation, HCM induced the generation of type&#8208;I/II reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hyperthermia effect, which cumulatively triggered mitochondrial damage and pyroptosis of tumor cells. HCM was systemically delivered via intracellular acidity&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles (namely PDPA@HCM NPs) to effectively trigger pyroptosis&#8208;driven antitumor immunity. Notably, HCM performed NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of pyroptosis&#8208;induced mitochondrial dysfunction by measuring viscosity change, thus enabling in situ monitoring of pyroptosis&#8208;mediated antitumor immunotherapy. In combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, the PDPA@HCM NPs dramatically regressed colorectal tumor growth in a mouse model. Overall, this study demonstrated that the TICTgens could serve as a versatile platform for pyroptosis induction and monitoring of pyroptosis&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Hybrid Active Sites in Coordination Polymers Enable Ampere&#8208;Level Acetylene Semihydrogenation in Membrane Electrode Assembly Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu coordination polymer featuring hybrid sites of open Cu sites and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes demonstrates superior performance for ampere&#8208;level acetylene semihydrogenation. The polymeric catalyst achieves 83.3% Faradaic efficiency of ethylene at &#8722;1.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 in pure acetylene feed and maintains stable operation with coal&#8208;derived acetylene (15%) for 200&#160;h, advancing sustainable ethylene production in membrane electrode assembly systems.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic acetylene semihydrogenation in membrane electrode assembly systems promises a sustainable pathway for ethylene production, yet faces challenges in catalyst performance and durability. Herein, we developed a Cu coordination polymer with hybrid sites that synergistically integrate open Cu sites and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. These hybrid sites bestow the coordination polymer with acetylene gasophilicity, hydrophobicity toward water, and readily accessible active Cu sites, which energetically facilitate acetylene absorption and vinyl intermediate formation, thereby enabling efficient ethylene production at ampere&#8208;level current densities. In a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with pure acetylene, this polymeric catalyst achieved high ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 93.1% at &#8722;0.5&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 83.3% at &#8722;1.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, with stable operation for 100&#160;h at &#8722;0.5&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. Notably, even with a 15% coal&#8208;derived acetylene at a flow rate of 60 standard cubic centimeters per minute, this catalyst system demonstrated 64.4% ethylene energy efficiency and durable performance over 200&#160;h at &#8722;0.5 A.

     alt="Hybrid Active Sites in Coordination Polymers Enable Ampere-Level Acetylene Semihydrogenation in Membrane Electrode Assembly Systems"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Cu coordination polymer featuring hybrid sites of open Cu sites and N-heterocyclic carbenes demonstrates superior performance for ampere-level acetylene semihydrogenation. The polymeric catalyst achieves 83.3% Faradaic efficiency of ethylene at &#8722;1.0&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in pure acetylene feed and maintains stable operation with coal-derived acetylene (15%) for 200&#160;h, advancing sustainable ethylene production in membrane electrode assembly systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic acetylene semihydrogenation in membrane electrode assembly systems promises a sustainable pathway for ethylene production, yet faces challenges in catalyst performance and durability. Herein, we developed a Cu coordination polymer with hybrid sites that synergistically integrate open Cu sites and N-heterocyclic carbenes. These hybrid sites bestow the coordination polymer with acetylene gasophilicity, hydrophobicity toward water, and readily accessible active Cu sites, which energetically facilitate acetylene absorption and vinyl intermediate formation, thereby enabling efficient ethylene production at ampere-level current densities. In a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with pure acetylene, this polymeric catalyst achieved high ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 93.1% at &#8722;0.5&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 83.3% at &#8722;1.0&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with stable operation for 100&#160;h at &#8722;0.5&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Notably, even with a 15% coal-derived acetylene at a flow rate of 60 standard cubic centimeters per minute, this catalyst system demonstrated 64.4% ethylene energy efficiency and durable performance over 200&#160;h at &#8722;0.5 A. This work advances the design of highly stable and active polymeric catalysts for electrocatalytic acetylene semihydrogenation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Structure&#8208;Selective On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Isokekulene Versus Kekulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface synthesis has allowed for the preparation of many novel molecular structures with intriguing properties. Here, we present a case of highly selective on&#8208;surface synthesis of the previously unknown cycloarene isokekulene on Cu(110) and the prototypical cycloarene kekulene on Cu(111) from the very same specialized precursor prepared in solution.








Abstract
The role of different facets of metal nanoparticles in steering reaction pathways is crucial for the design of heterogeneous catalysts with superior selectivity. As a prominent class of reactions, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8208;hydrogen (C&#9472;H) bond activation is widely used for the synthesis of base chemicals, modern organic materials, and pharmaceuticals. Here, we report orthogonal selectivity in intramolecular cyclodehydrogenation of a nonplanar cyclic precursor steered by different facets of a copper single crystal. On the Cu(110) surface, the previously unknown cycloarene isokekulene forms with a high selectivity of 92%, whereas reaction on the Cu(111) surface exclusively yields kekulene (&gt;99%). Combining scanning tunneling microscopy with CO&#8208;functionalized tips and density functional theory, we identify two adsorption geometries of the precursor, which react to the respective products. Isokekulene adopts two nonplanar adsorption configurations and exhibits strong molecule&#8208;substrate interactions, explaining its preferential formation on Cu(110). This combined in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface synthesis approach represents an alternative route for the highly selective synthesis of molecules that are challenging to synthesize and process via conventional methods.

         <title>Narrowband Organic Afterglow Materials Exhibiting 11.2&#160;nm FWHM, 38% Phosphorescence Efficiency and 1.5&#160;s Emission Lifetime Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A jade pendant&#8208;like molecular design enables narrowband organic afterglow with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) down to 11.2&#160;nm. By enhancing low&#8208;frequency vibronic coupling in a coronene&#8208;based localized&#8208;excitation system, the material exhibits long&#8208;lived phosphorescence and even organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) under ambient conditions.








Abstract
Narrowband organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) remains rare due to significant high&#8208;frequency vibronic coupling in T1&#8594;S0 electronic transition, where T1 and S0 represent the lowest triplet excited state and ground state, respectively. Here, we report coronene&#8208;derived (CoDe) luminophores exhibiting ultra&#8208;narrowband RTP (full width at half maximum FWHM&#160;=&#160;11.2&#160;nm) with a&#160;1.5 s lifetime and 38% afterglow efficiency in a phenyl benzoate (PhB) matrix. The narrow emission arises from enhanced coupling with low&#8208;frequency vibrational modes in localized excitation (LE) states, as supported by vibronic simulations. Under high&#8208;power excitation, the CoDe&#8208;PhB further exhibits organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) lasting over 40&#160;min (FWHM&#160;=&#160;14.7&#160;nm), governed by a two&#8208;photon ionization&#8208;induced charge&#8208;separation mechanism. The materials are processable via melt&#8208;casting and excitable by ambient or white light, offering practical utility for high&#8208;color&#8208;purity afterglow display and lighting applications. This work establishes low&#8208;frequency vibronic engineering as a new route to narrowband RTP and OLPL emitters beyond conventional multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;based designs.

         <title>Unconventional PROTACs for Targeted Protein Degradation in Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the challenges of conventional proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs), various &#8220;unconventional PROTACs&#8221; including PROTACs with unconventional binding ligands, PROTACs with unconventional linkers, pro&#8208;PROTACs, and self&#8208;assembled PROTACs have been proposed. These unconventional PROTACs show great promise for targeted protein degradation in cancer therapy. This review summarizes recent advances in the development of unconventional PROTACs.








Abstract
Targeted protein degradation, which aims to eliminate dysregulated proteins, has emerged as a promising strategy for conquering challenging therapeutic targets. Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) is a heterobifunctional molecule that utilizes the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system to selectively degrade target proteins. Due to its ability to degrade &#8220;undruggable&#8221; proteins without causing drug resistance, PROTAC has shown great potential in innovative drug development, especially in cancer therapy. However, conventional PROTACs suffer from several limitations, such as limited solubility, poor permeability, hook effect, and off&#8208;target toxicity. Therefore, structural innovation of conventional PROTACs to make them meet the therapeutic demand is essential for unlocking the full potential of PROTACs as a therapeutic tool. Here, we summarize four types of unconventional PROTACs for addressing the above challenges and enhancing cancer therapy efficacy, including PROTACs with unconventional binding ligands, PROTACs with unconventional linkers, pro&#8208;PROTACs, and self&#8208;assembled PROTACs. These optimized designs contribute to the development of PROTACs&#8208;based universal platforms, providing directions for innovative drug developments and expanding the applications of PROTACs in cancer therapy.

         <title>Completing the Biosynthesis of the Clinically Important Diterpenoid Andrographolide in Andrographis Paniculata</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytochrome P450s involved in andrographolide C&#8208;3, C&#8208;14, and C&#8208;19 hydroxylation, as well as lactone ring formation, were discovered by bioinformatic analysis along with N. benthamiana transient expression and yeast microsomal assays. Co&#8208;expression of ApCYP71D587, ApCYP71BE50, ApCYP706U5, and ApCYP72F1 with ent&#8208;copalol biosynthetic genes enabled production of andrographolide in N. benthamiana.








Abstract
Andrographolide is a prominent labdane diterpenoid extracted from Andrographis paniculata with exceptional anti&#8208;inflammatory properties. Commercial production of andrographolide relies exclusively on extraction from plant resources. Although the scaffold of andrographolide ent&#8208;copalol has previously been biosynthesized, further oxidative modifications remain elusive. In this study, by taking an integrated analysis of transcriptomes and metabolomes, we were able to identify four cytochrome P450 enzymes constituting the minimal set of andrographolide biosynthetic genes. Specifically, ApCYP71D587 catalyzes the conversion of ent&#8208;copalol to 19&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;ent&#8208;copalol. Subsequently, ApCYP71BE50 mediates the formation of the lactone ring, ultimately yielding andrograpanin. Then ApCYP706U5 accomplishes the third step by mediating the C&#8208;3 hydroxylation reaction, thereby allowing the formation of 14&#8208;deoxyandrographolide. Ultimately, ApCYP72F1 completes the biosynthetic generation of andrographolide with C&#8208;14 hydroxylation of the lactone and rearrangement of the olefin bond. In addition, co&#8208;expression of the minimal gene set in N. benthamiana engineered to produce ent&#8208;copalol feasibly produces andrographolide, thus establishing an innovative metabolic engineering strategy to produce this medicine of historical importance, circumventing the need for plant extraction.

&lt;p&gt;Cytochrome P450s involved in andrographolide C-3, C-14, and C-19 hydroxylation, as well as lactone ring formation, were discovered by bioinformatic analysis along with &lt;i&gt;N. benthamiana&lt;/i&gt; transient expression and yeast microsomal assays. Co-expression of &lt;i&gt;ApCYP71D587&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ApCYP71BE50&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ApCYP706U5&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ApCYP72F1&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;ent&lt;/i&gt;-copalol biosynthetic genes enabled production of andrographolide in &lt;i&gt;N. benthamiana&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrographolide is a prominent labdane diterpenoid extracted from &lt;i&gt;Andrographis paniculata&lt;/i&gt; with exceptional anti-inflammatory properties. Commercial production of andrographolide relies exclusively on extraction from plant resources. Although the scaffold of andrographolide &lt;i&gt;ent&lt;/i&gt;-copalol has previously been biosynthesized, further oxidative modifications remain elusive. In this study, by taking an integrated analysis of transcriptomes and metabolomes, we were able to identify four cytochrome P450 enzymes constituting the minimal set of andrographolide biosynthetic genes. Specifically, ApCYP71D587 catalyzes the conversion of &lt;i&gt;ent&lt;/i&gt;-copalol to 19-hydroxy-&lt;i&gt;ent&lt;/i&gt;-copalol. Subsequently, ApCYP71BE50 mediates the formation of the lactone ring, ultimately yielding andrograpanin.

         <title>Surface Halide Manipulation for Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface halide substitution strategy is applied to establish function&#8208;gradient inorganic perovskite, producing stable chlorine&#8208;rich layers atop iodine&#8208;rich ones, achieving 21.2% efficiency in unit cells and 19.2% efficiency in modules, resulting in a projected T80 lifetime of 7.3 years. This makes them among the most stable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite devices.








Abstract
Iodine&#8208;rich inorganic perovskites possessing desirable bandgaps as well as high thermal and chemical stability are facing serious issues of low polymorphic stability, whereas chlorine&#8208;rich inorganic perovskites hold outstanding thermodynamic stability but suffer from low efficiency. Here, we develop function&#8208;gradient inorganic perovskites adopting a surface halide substitution strategy, where a stable chlorine&#8208;rich skin protects efficient iodine&#8208;rich layers, incorporating high stability of chlorine&#8208;rich perovskites with high efficiency of iodine&#8208;rich perovskites. This strategy simultaneously passivates surface defects and stabilizes the photoactive polymorphs of perovskite, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 21.2% for unit cells (0.16 cm2) and 19.2% for solar modules (23.9 cm2). Notably, the compositional gradient mitigates light&#8208;induced ion migration and enhances resistance to environmental erosion. Thus, our devices exhibit negligible efficiency loss after 1000 h storage in air and 3200 h operation under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination at 40&#160;&#176;C, representing the most stable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells reported to date.

         <title>Self&#8208;Promoting Targeted Delivery of Epigenetic Immunostimulants to Activate Breast Cancer Immunity via HDACs Downregulation and PD&#8208;L1 Upregulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;promoting targeted immunostimulant is designed to selectively co&#8208;deliver photosensitizer Ce6 and HDAC inhibitor TSA to breast cancer cells, thereby enhancing tumor immunogenicity and reshaping the immunosuppressive microenvironment for collective activation of anti&#8208;tumor immunity by HDACs downregulation and PD&#8208;L1 upregulation.








Abstract
The low immunogenicity and immunosuppressive phenotype of breast cancer significantly limit the effectiveness of immunotherapy. This study reveals that histone deacetylases (HDACs) are upregulated in breast cancer, while lower levels of HDACs and higher levels of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) are associated with better patient prognosis. Moreover, Trichostatin A (TSA) is confirmed to suppress HDACs and increase PD&#8208;L1 expression. Building on these insights, a self&#8208;promoting targeted immunostimulant (SPT&#8208;IS) is developed to activate breast cancer immunity by epigenetically upregulating PD&#8208;L1. SPT&#8208;IS can selectively accumulate in PD&#8208;L1&#8208;overexpressing breast cancer cells for co&#8208;delivery of Chlorin e6 (Ce6) and TSA. Notably, SPT&#8208;IS&#8208;induced epigenetic upregulation of PD&#8208;L1 creates a self&#8208;promoting tumor&#8208;targeting loop that enhances drug delivery efficiency. Besides, SPT&#8208;IS generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill tumor cells and release damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, increasing tumor immunogenicity. Additionally, the epigenetic regulation ability of SPT&#8208;IS upregulates immunomodulatory cytokines and stimulates T cell cytotoxicity for immune activation. Immunological results confirm robust immunomodulatory effects of SPT&#8208;IS, significantly enhancing tumor&#8208;infiltrating lymphocytes recruitment and proliferation, leading to notable anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. These findings highlight the potential of a self&#8208;promoting targeted strategy to enhance drug delivery and provide an epigenetic approach to boost the immune response against breast cancer.

         <title>Steric&#8208;Dominated Intermediate Stabilization by Organic Cations Enables Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an organic cation engineering strategy utilizing steric hindrance effects to regulate intermediate adsorption during CO2 electroreduction. The elongation of alkyl chains facilitates K+ displacement while enhancing organic cation adsorption on copper surfaces. These synergistic effects strengthen crucial intermediate binding, thereby improving formic acid selectivity.








Abstract
Precisely modulating the binding energies of intermediates through cationic engineering remains a pivotal challenge in controlling reaction pathways and improving selectivity for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Although alkali cations are widely recognized as stabilizing intermediates via electrostatic interactions, this study proposes a steric&#8208;effect&#8208;dominated strategy using organic quaternary ammonium cations (CnTA+) to flexibly tune the adsorption of intermediates. Through in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflectance&#8208;surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS), we elucidate that CnTA+ cations with longer alkyl chains substitute K+ more efficiently within the electrical double layer, exhibiting higher affinity for the Cu surface. This steric dominance significantly enhances the adsorption of key intermediates, steering the pathway toward formic acid (HCOOH) production. An improved Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 90% for HCOOH was achieved using octadecyl trimethyl ammonium (C18TA+) cations. This molecular engineering strategy provides a route to flexibly tune the adsorption of intermediates to improve the performance of CO2RR.

         <title>Efficient Bicarbonate Electrolysis to Formate Enabled via Ionomer Surface Modification in Cation Exchange Membrane Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>

A new electrolyzer configuration, featuring a single cation exchange membrane and surface&#8208;modified bismuth catalyst, is designed for bicarbonate electrolysis. This configuration enables highly efficient production of formate and significantly reduced operating voltage, providing a potential solution for direct CO2 utilization from point source emissions.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) is a promising method for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals, with formate being a particularly viable product. However, current gas&#8208;fed CO2RR systems rely on highly pure CO2 feed gases and are incompatible with point&#8208;source CO2 emissions without prior capture and concentration. Bicarbonate electrolysis offers a potential solution by bridging the gap between CO2 emissions and utilization. However, existing electrolyzer configurations, especially those using bipolar membranes (BPM), require high working voltages and suffer from poor energy efficiency. Here, we present a cation exchange membrane (CEM)&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly (MEA) incorporating a surface&#8208;modified bismuth cathode catalyst. The success of this approach is attributed to two key factors: the use of the positively charged ionomer PiperION for surface modification, which creates a favorable cathode microenvironment; the single CEM that enhances proton flux from the anode to the cathode while reducing ionic impedance. The CEM&#8208;based MEA demonstrates a formate faradaic efficiency of up to 80%, with a significant 1.5&#160;V reduction in operating voltage compared to BPM&#8208;based MEAs at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Additionally, the CEM&#8208;based MEA exhibits excellent tolerance to O2 impurities and maintains high performance even with simulated flue gas, making it suitable for direct CO2 utilization from point sources.

This configuration enables highly efficient production of formate and significantly reduced operating voltage, providing a potential solution for direct CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization from point source emissions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) is a promising method for converting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into valuable chemicals, with formate being a particularly viable product. However, current gas-fed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR systems rely on highly pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; feed gases and are incompatible with point-source CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions without prior capture and concentration. Bicarbonate electrolysis offers a potential solution by bridging the gap between CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and utilization. However, existing electrolyzer configurations, especially those using bipolar membranes (BPM), require high working voltages and suffer from poor energy efficiency. Here, we present a cation exchange membrane (CEM)-based membrane electrode assembly (MEA) incorporating a surface-modified bismuth cathode catalyst. The success of this approach is attributed to two key factors: the use of the positively charged ionomer PiperION for surface modification, which creates a favorable cathode microenvironment; the single CEM that enhances proton flux from the anode to the cathode while reducing ionic impedance. The CEM-based MEA demonstrates a formate faradaic efficiency of up to 80%, with a significant 1.5&#160;V reduction in operating voltage compared to BPM-based MEAs at 300&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, the CEM-based MEA exhibits excellent tolerance to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; impurities and maintains high performance even with simulated flue gas, making it suitable for direct CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization from point sources.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Universal Metal&#8208;Exchange Strategy for Room Temperature Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general room&#8208;temperature metal&#8208;exchange strategy was developed to prepare single&#8208;atom nanozymes with excellent catalase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, and oxidase&#8208;like activities. ZIF&#8208;8 derived Zn single&#8208;atoms catalysts with high 12.10&#160;wt% loading was screened for exchange due to the weak binding ability of Zn to support confirmed by DFT calculation. Low temperature metal&#8208;exchange avoided the thermal aggregation and provided nearly 100% accessibility of single&#8208;atoms. 








Abstract
The high&#8208;temperature limitations of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) synthesis, primarily thermal aggregation and low metal loadings, are overcome by a novel room&#8208;temperature metal&#8208;exchange strategy. We leverage the weak Zn&#9472;N coordination in high&#8208;loading Zn SACs (12.10&#160;wt%, synthesized via controlled ZIF&#8208;8 pyrolysis) as a platform for the facile exchange with a broad range of metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Pt, up to 12.67&#160;wt%) and the creation of multi&#8208;metallic species. This ambient&#8208;temperature approach significantly reduces aggregation, enhancing the exposure of catalytic active sites and delivering superior multi&#8208;enzyme&#8208;like activities (catalase, peroxidase, oxidase). Our work not only provides a scalable, low&#8208;temperature route to high&#8208;performance SACs but also reveals crucial insights into the stability of SACs under metal&#8208;ion conditions.

         <title>Location&#8208;Differentiated DNA Hierarchical Cyclic Construction Demarcating Identical Biomolecules Across Cell Membrane Microenvironments</title>

Spatial demarcation of identical biomolecules across distinct cell membrane microenvironments has not been well determined. Here we report location&#8208;differentiated DNA hierarchical cyclic construction for lipid raft&#8208;differentiated spatial profiling in living cells. It can differentially visualize identical biomolecules inside and outside lipid rafts, and quantitatively measures molecule distribution rate (lipid raft to the whole cell membrane).








Abstract
Local molecular composition across cell membrane microenvironments exerts profound effects on cellular physiology and pathology. Yet spatial demarcation of identical biomolecules inside and outside lipid raft microdomains has not been determined. Here we report location&#8208;differentiated DNA hierarchical cyclic construction for lipid raft&#8208;differentiated spatial profiling of identical biomolecules in living cells. It contains two sequential DNA cyclic construction reactions: primary one triggered by total target molecules and secondary one activated by lipid raft's location markers proximal to target molecules. Using this method, we differentially visualize identical biomolecules localized in lipid raft and non&#8208;lipid raft microdomains with different signals. We demonstrate the robustness and universality of this method by testing cell surface RNAs and proteins in diverse cell types. We reveal their diverse spatial demarcation with intrinsic heterogeneity. In both lipid raft&#8208;disrupting cells and senescent cells, MUC1 protein is dynamically organized between these two microdomains. Our strategy provides a promising avenue to investigate physiological and pathological functions of dynamic molecular compositions across cellular microenvironments.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Y(N5)3&#183;N2 Pentazolate with Perovskite Topology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Yttrium pentazolate, Y(N5)3&#183;N2, with an exceptionally high nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratio of 17:1 and perovskite topology, was synthesized from yttrium and nitrogen at 125&#160;GPa and 3000&#160;K in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell.








Abstract
The discovery and stabilization of the cyclo&#8208;N5&#8315; anion have introduced a class of pentazolate compounds with significant potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials (HEDMs). This potential could be further enhanced by increasing the pentazolate&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratio. Here, we report the high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature synthesis and characterization of a novel yttrium pentazolate, Y(N5)3&#183;N2, which exhibits an exceptionally high nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratio of 17:1. Y(N5)3&#183;N2 was synthesized from yttrium and nitrogen by laser heating to 3000&#160;K at 125&#160;GPa in a diamond anvil cell. Its crystal structure, a 3D nitrogen&#8208;inclusion metal&#8208;pentazolate framework, was solved and refined in situ using synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. This structure demonstrates a perovskite topology, as pentazolate ring centers form octahedra connected via vertices, neutral nitrogen dimers are located at the centers of the octahedra, and yttrium atoms occupy distorted cuboctahedra within the octahedral 3D framework. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate the experimental findings and provide further insights into the stability and properties of the synthesized compound. Y(N5)3&#183;N2 is the first example of stabilizing three pentazolate anions per metal cation, surpassing the previously achieved 1:1 ratio. Additionally, we propose a centroid&#8208;based structure typification for solvent&#8208;free inorganic pentazolates, serving as an important step for further structural classification of pentazolates and other polynitrides.

         <title>Synthesis of Chroman Derivatives by Group Transposition and Atom Swapping in 1&#8208;Tetralones: Single&#8208;Atom Editing Enabled by Oxidative Ring Contraction of Benzoxepine Silyl Ketene Acetals</title>

         <dc:description>
Step beyond the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger: A chemical sequence from tetralines to chromans involving a carbon&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen atom swap and a stepwise ring enlargement/ring contraction has been developed. This protocol for carbon deletion is operationally simple and applicable to complex systems, as illustrated by the modification of natural products and a short total synthesis of heliannuol E.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom editing of complex molecules is steadily filling the chemical toolbox with site&#8208;selective modification reactions. Herein, a stepwise scheme for carbon&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen swap in tetralins leading to privileged chroman scaffolds is presented. Increasing the oxidation state at each stage, the substrate scope naturally extends: starting from tetralins via 1&#8208;tetralones and further via seven&#8208;membered lactones, the transformation results in diverse chroman&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acids and chroman&#8208;2&#8208;ols. The efficiency of this synthetic route is governed by the developed new oxidative ring&#8208;contractive transformations of tetrahydrobenzooxepinones, enabled by intermediate silylation into ketene acetals. The described carbon&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen swap is illustrated by 40+ examples, including skeletal editing of natural products and short formal synthesis of Heliannuol E. Formation of chroman&#8208;2&#8208;ols tentatively may proceed via original mechanism with extrusion of carbon monoxide.

         <title>Unexpected Activities of CYP152 Peroxygenases Toward Non&#8208;carboxylic Substrates Reveal Novel Substrate Recognition Mechanism and Catalytic Versatility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study unveils novel aromatic hydroxylation and dehalogenation activities of CYP152 peroxygenases toward various aromatic pollutants without any carboxyl group. Mechanistic analyses provide new insights into non&#8208;carboxylic substrate&#8208;assisted acid&#8208;base catalysis for hydrogen peroxide activation, inspiring potential applications in industrial biocatalysis and environmental remediation.








Abstract
Exploring and exploiting the catalytic promiscuity of enzymes is a central topic and captivating challenge in enzymology. CYP152 peroxygenases are attractive biocatalysts for diverse reactions under mild conditions using H2O2 as cofactor. However, their substrate scope is limited by a carboxyl group required for substrate assisted acid&#8208;base catalysis, following the well&#8208;accepted principle that heme&#8208;dependent H2O2&#8208;utilizing enzymes employ a carboxyl group within their active sites to facilitate H2O2 activation. Herein, we reveal for the first time that several CYP152 family members can directly degrade various aromatic pollutants without any carboxyl group, exhibiting novel aromatic hydroxylation and dehalogenation activities. Through crystal structure analysis, isotope tracing experiments, and QM/MM calculations, we elucidate that the phenolic hydroxyl group activated by electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent(s) functionally replaces the carboxyl group, forming hydrogen bonds with the conserved arginine leading to Compound I formation. The oxygen atom of the newly formed hydroxyl group originates from water, bypassing the conventional oxygen rebound step. These findings provide first insights into the mechanisms of P450 peroxygenases toward non&#8208;carboxylic substrates, expanding our knowledge of biological C&#9472;H activation and C&#8208;halogen bond cleavage beyond canonical P450 reactions. This discovery holds immense potential for harnessing these enzymes in innovative strategies for industrial biocatalysis and environmental remediation.

         <title>Chiral Diazatriptycene Exhibiting Acid&#8208;Induced Ternary Circularly Polarized Luminescence Switching and Crystal Morphology Changes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) control, including on/off and +/&#8722; switching was achieved by chiral double N&#8208;doping of the triptycene system. Dramatic crystal morphology changes, including a herringbone, trimer cluster, chiral porous tube, and 2D charge&#8208;segregated array, were also observed when using an acidic medium, which showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement CPL (AIEE&#8208;CPL).








Abstract
Doubly N&#8208;doped triptycene 2,6&#8208;diazatriptycene 1 was synthesized as the first example of triptycene&#8208;bearing intrinsic chirality in its core. The resolved enantiomers exhibited an acid&#8208;induced ternary circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switching behavior, enabling on/off and +/&#8722; control, with a dissymmetry factor (glum) of approximately 10&#8722;3. Density functional theory calculations indicated that these ternary CPL changes were derived from modulation of through&#8208;space conjugation within the triptycene skeleton. In addition, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of 1 and the salt 1&#8226;(TfOH)n revealed the presence of herringbone arrangements, trimer clusters, chiral porous tubes, and 2D charge&#8208;segregated array structures. These results demonstrate that precise change of the molecular assembly can be achieved using N&#8208;doped chiral triptycene facilitated by ionic hydrogen bonding and donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking.

         <title>A Cu&#8208;Pb Hybrid Layer Architecture as a New Structural Prototype for High&#8208;Efficiency 2D Double Perovskite Broadband Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enrich the structural chemistry and improve the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of typical two&#8208;dimensional (2D) lead perovskites, we proposed a novel multicomponent structural engineering strategy and designed new class of 2D double perovskites of [AMP]2Cu2PbX8 [AMP&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;(Aminomethyl)piperidinium, X&#9552;Br and I], which is completely different from the typical A2BIBIIIX8&#8208;type double perovskites. Compared to the negligible luminescence (PLQY&#160;&lt;&#160;2%) of 2D [AMP]2PbX4 analogs, the [AMP]2Cu2PbX8 compounds demonstrate strong broadband yellow&#8208;orange emissions (PLQY&#160;&gt;&#160;48%) due to enhanced exciton binding energy, electron/hole effective mass, exciton confinement efficiency and exciton self&#8208;trapping depth. 








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic lead halide perovskites have emerged as promising next&#8208;generation luminescent materials due to their high chemical versatility and excellent broadband light emission properties. However, their practical applications are often limited by low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) caused by insufficient exciton confinement and extended charge&#8208;carrier diffusion lengths within the 2D anionic layers. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel multicomponent structural engineering strategy that led to the design of [AMP]2Cu2PbX8 double perovskites [AMP&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;(Aminomethyl)piperidinium, X&#9552;Br&#8722; and I&#8722;]. These materials feature [Cu2PbX8]4&#8722; monolayers consisting of alternating corner&#8208;sharing [Cu2X6]4&#8722; dimers and [PbX6]4&#8722; octahedra. Compared to the negligible luminescence observed in 2D [AMP]PbX4 analogs, the [AMP]2Cu2PbX8 compounds demonstrate strong broadband yellow&#8208;orange emission originating from self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs), achieving high PLQYs exceeding 48%. Comprehensive spectroscopic analysis and theoretical studies reveal that the incorporation of [Cu2X6]4&#8722; dimers simultaneously enhances exciton binding energy, electron/hole effective mass, exciton confinement efficiency and STE self&#8208;trapping depth, which are all critical factors contributing to the improved PLQY. This work successfully demonstrates a new class of 2D double perovskites with exceptional luminescent performance, advancing perovskite chemistry through a dual&#8208;engineering strategy that concurrently optimizes both material structure and photophysical properties.

         <title>Sn Catalysts with Build&#8208;in [NCN]2&#8722; as Proton Relay for Industrial&#8208;Grade CO2 Reduction at Low Overpotential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>

[NCN]2&#8722; anion is introduced into the skeleton structure of the Sn&#8208;based catalyst, using the built&#8208;in [NCN]2&#8722; functional groups to construct proton transfer channels and facilitate proton transport, effectively solving the proton transfer challenge under industrial current density. The SnNCN catalyst achieved a jHCOO&#8211; of 450&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for HCOO&#8722; production at an overpotential as low as 360&#160;mV. 








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2R) involves multiproton electron transfer, characterized by sluggish reaction kinetics and challenges including high overpotential and subsequently poor stability. Facilitating proton transfer through rational catalyst design to reduce the applied potential enables effective and durable CO2 reduction. Herein, a proton migration promotion strategy to accelerate the CO2 protonation and the overall ECO2R process was explored by Sn&#8208;based cyanamide catalysts. Catalysts with varying [NCN]2&#8722; content, from SnO to Sn2ONCN and SnNCN, were investigated to elucidate the proton transfer mechanism of build&#8208;in [NCN]2&#8722;. The reversible structural transformation between [N&#9552;C&#9552;N]2&#8722; and [N&#8801;C&#9472;N]2&#8722; from [NCN]2&#8722; group achieves an efficient proton relay effect. More efficient CO2 conversion to HCOOH is achieved with a higher content of build&#8208;in [NCN]2&#8722; groups in structures. Among these catalysts, SnNCN showed a current density of 450&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a low overpotential of 360&#160;mV, with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 97.4% for HCOO&#8722; production and a peak cathodic energy conversion efficiency (ECE) of 79.6%. Furthermore, it produced formate (HCOO&#8722;) continuously for over 110&#160;h at 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and pure formic acid (HCOOH) solution for 192&#160;h at 135.8&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This study provides a novel material system and a fresh perspective for the design of efficient ECO2R catalysts.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) involves multiproton electron transfer, characterized by sluggish reaction kinetics and challenges including high overpotential and subsequently poor stability. Facilitating proton transfer through rational catalyst design to reduce the applied potential enables effective and durable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. Herein, a proton migration promotion strategy to accelerate the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; protonation and the overall ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R process was explored by Sn-based cyanamide catalysts. Catalysts with varying [NCN]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; content, from SnO to Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ONCN and SnNCN, were investigated to elucidate the proton transfer mechanism of build-in [NCN]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The reversible structural transformation between [N&#9552;C&#9552;N]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [N&#8801;C&#9472;N]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; from [NCN]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; group achieves an efficient proton relay effect. More efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion to HCOOH is achieved with a higher content of build-in [NCN]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups in structures. Among these catalysts, SnNCN showed a current density of 450&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a low overpotential of 360&#160;mV, with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 97.4% for HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; production and a peak cathodic energy conversion efficiency (ECE) of 79.6%. Furthermore, it produced formate (HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) continuously for over 110&#160;h at 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and pure formic acid (HCOOH) solution for 192&#160;h at 135.8&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This study provides a novel material system and a fresh perspective for the design of efficient ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An innovative in&#8208;situ dynamic compensation strategy was successfully implemented to construct Zn&#8208;doped dual&#8208;active&#8208;site copper hexacyanoferrate (ZnCuHCF). Zn incorporation triggers a Cu&#8211;N coordination transition from hexacoordination to pentacoordination, reducing bond length variation of 0.204 to 0.209&#160;nm during NH4+ interalation, thus strengthening the ZnCuHCF framework. Additionally, a dynamic compensation strategy ensures that newly&#8208;developed ZnCuHCF with dual&#8208;active sites exhibits 0.94&#160;V discharge potential, 121.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 capacity at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, and 92.1% capacity retention after 10&#160;000 cycles. 








Abstract
Copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) with 3D channels and high discharge plateau is widely recognized as a highly promising cathode material for ammonium&#8208;ion (NH4+) storage. However, the practical application of CuHCF has faced challenges due to limited capacity and structural instability, primarily arising from single active site and serious Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions. Herein, an innovative in&#8208;situ dynamic compensation strategy is reported to prepare Zn&#8208;doping dual&#8208;active&#8208;site CuHCF (ZnCuHCF) as high&#8208;energy and ultrastable cathode materials for NH4+ storage. Zn doping induces fission of Cu e2g orbitals, causing lattice to aberrate and reach stable state, while during NH4+ intercalation process, changes mainly in Fe t2g electronic orbitals help maintain stability of ZnCuHCF structure. Consequently, ZnCuHCF in 23&#160;m NH4OTf&#160;+&#160;0.5&#160;m Zn(OTf)2 aqueous electrolyte exhibits high discharge potential of 0.94&#160;V, high capacity of 121.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 and impressive capacity retention of 92.1% after 10&#160;000 cycles. To highlight, fiber&#8208;shaped aqueous Zn/NH4 hybrid batteries based on ZnCuHCF cathode are successfully constructed, achieving admirable energy density of 85.73&#160;mWh&#160;g&#8722;1 and remarkable capacity retention of 85.2% after 12&#160;500 cycles. This work paves the way for designing CuHCF with high capacity, high voltage and robust cycling stability in NH4+ storage for applications in wearable aqueous batteries.

         <title>A Thorough Characterization of the Tellurocyanate Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
[K@crypt&#8208;222][TeCN] was synthesized from KCN, Te, and crypt&#8208;222 in acetone. We discuss fundamental properties of [TeCN]&#8722;: Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance (13C, 15N, 125Te), vibrational spectroscopy, and negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy. All experimental data is supported by high&#8208;level quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.








Abstract
Tellurocyanate, [TeCN]&#8722;, is the heaviest group 16 congener of the cyanate anion, [OCN]&#8722;. Due to the relative instability of the C&#9472;Te bond, tellurocyanate chemistry has seen only scarce attention. Here, we present the facile synthesis and thorough characterization of [K@crypt&#8208;222][TeCN]. The anion is essentially linear with interatomic distances C&#9472;N&#160;=&#160;1.150(6)&#197; and C&#9472;Te&#160;=&#160;2.051(4)&#197;, thus approximating a C&#8801;N triple bond and for C&#9472;Te a bond order between 1 and 2. Fully 13C and 15N labeled [Te13C15N]&#8722; allowed for the extraction of chemical shifts and all possible coupling constants (13C&#160;=&#160;77.8 ppm, 15N&#160;=&#160;285.7&#160;ppm, 125Te&#160;=&#160;&#8722;566&#160;ppm, 1J13C&#8208;15N&#160;=&#160;8 Hz, 1J13C&#8208;125Te&#160;=&#160;748&#160;Hz, 2J15N&#8208;125Te&#160;=&#160;55&#160;Hz), which were also determined independently by quantum chemical calculations. In the series [ChCN]&#8722; (Ch&#160;=&#160;O&#9472;Te), [TeCN]&#8722; shows the strongest spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) induced heavy&#8208;atom effect on the light&#8208;atom shielding (SO&#8208;HALA&#8208;effect). In contrast, 15N shifts are also well described without considering relativistic effects and/or SOC. Negative&#8208;ion photoelectron spectroscopy was used to extract the electron affinity (EA&#160;=&#160;3.034&#160;eV) and spin&#8208;orbit splitting (3807&#160;cm&#8722;1) of [TeCN]&#8226;. These values continue the trends of falling EA and rising SOC in the series [ChCN]&#8226;.

         <title>Framework Integration for Adaptive Interfaces in Flexible Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchically integrated architecture has been engineered through robust electrostatic assembly, yielding a structurally coherent framework that coordinates dynamic interfacial modulation. This design enables the emergence of a thermodynamically stable, low&#8208;impedance interface characterized by optimized conduits for simultaneous ionic and electronic transport mechanisms. Furthermore, the self&#8208;regulating interface effectively accelerates charge transfer and the reversible decomposition of Li2O2, delivering exceptional electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs), with their remarkable energy density, represent a pivotal advancement in energy storage technology. However, conventional Li&#8211;O2 batteries face significant obstacles. This study introduces polyacrylonitrile (PAN)&#8208;based polymer membranes and self&#8208;supporting cathodes fabricated via electrospinning and thermal treatment. By incorporating poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA)&#8208;functionalized cathodes through electrostatic adsorption, a polymeric electrolyte&#8208;functional integrated linkage structure was developed. This design facilitates adaptive interface modulation, creating a stable low&#8208;impedance interface between the electrolyte and cathode while enabling efficient ion and electron transport. The resulting solid&#8208;state LOBs (SSLOBs) demonstrate exceptional performance, achieving a specific capacity of 8600&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and a cycling lifespan of 191 cycles. The adaptive interface provides abundant reaction sites, promoting uniform ring&#8208;like discharge product growth and reversible decomposition. Additionally, flexible batteries incorporating this structure exhibit outstanding resilience to bending deformation. These advancements highlight the transformative potential of Li&#8211;O2 batteries, offering promising directions for future energy storage research.

By incorporating poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA)-functionalized cathodes through electrostatic adsorption, a polymeric electrolyte-functional integrated linkage structure was developed. This design facilitates adaptive interface modulation, creating a stable low-impedance interface between the electrolyte and cathode while enabling efficient ion and electron transport. The resulting solid-state LOBs (SSLOBs) demonstrate exceptional performance, achieving a specific capacity of 8600&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a cycling lifespan of 191 cycles. The adaptive interface provides abundant reaction sites, promoting uniform ring-like discharge product growth and reversible decomposition. Additionally, flexible batteries incorporating this structure exhibit outstanding resilience to bending deformation. These advancements highlight the transformative potential of Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries, offering promising directions for future energy storage research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anomalous pH&#8208;Dependence of Ru for Hydrogen Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dichotomy between the &#8220;canonical&#8221; (Pt) and &#8220;anomalous&#8221; (Ru) pH responses in hydrogen electrochemistry challenges the universality of existing theoretical systems. By decoding the anomalous pH dependence of Ru, this work provides chances to resolve current theoretical limitations in complex interfacial processes, contributing to a unified physical model for understanding hydrogen electrocatalysis.








Abstract
The essence of the classic pH&#8208;dependent catalytic behavior of Pt toward hydrogen electrochemistry has been debated for decades. In stark contrast, Ru represents a unique exception by exhibiting intrinsically anomalous pH dependence among Pt&#8208;group metals, significantly challenging the universal validity of the existing mechanistic system derived from classic pH effects. To decode the chemical essence beneath the unique anomalous pH dependence, refined multidimensional structural characterizations and electrical transport spectroscopic studies reveal that the electron delocalization on Ru surface enables strong oxophilicity and unique pH&#8208;dependent coverage of OH*, essentially different from the H*&#8208;dominated Pt surface. The enriched OH* breaks the classic pH&#8208;dependent rule by forming hydrogen bond&#8208;regulated interfacial water structures, thus creating a unique chemical environment for alkaline hydrogen catalysis. By clearly decoding the anomalous pH&#8208;dependent behavior of Ru, our work provides new chances to improve the physicochemical model for re&#8208;understanding hydrogen electrochemistry.

         <title>Carboxylate&#8208;Based Electrolyte with Bilateral Functions Enable Working Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries at &#8722;60&#176;C</title>

A carboxylate&#8208;based electrolyte featuring solvent&#8208;anion synergism and self&#8208;purification can accelerate interfacial kinetics, stabilize interphases, and enable sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) to operate reliably at &#8722;60 &#176;C.








Abstract
Sluggish interfacial reaction kinetics and unstable electrode/electrolyte interphases seriously hinder the practical applications of sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) with extremely low&#8208;temperature performance. Here, we propose an ester&#8208;based electrolyte featuring solvent&#8208;anion synergistic and self&#8208;purification functions that empowers SMBs to operate stably at record&#8208;low temperatures down to &#8722;60 &#176;C. The weakly solvating fluorinated solvent (ethyl difluoroacetate, [EDFA]) constructs an anion&#8208;dominated solvated structure, where the high&#8208;donor&#8208;number trifluoroacetate anion (TFA&#8722;) synergistically reduces the Na+ desolvation energy barrier while triggering the defluorination of EDFA. This dynamic process in situ generates inorganic components (e.g., NaF) in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Further, tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphite (TMSPi) additive effectively scavenges corrosive HF species through a self&#8208;purification mechanism, ensuring durable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase formation. As a result, the ester&#8208;based SMBs render a capacity retention of 96% at &#8722;40 &#176;C (relative to the room&#8208;temperature capacity), exceptional rate capacity (81.64 mAh g&#8722;1 at 400&#160;mA g&#8722;1 with 70.26% retention at &#8722;40 &#176;C, which is the best rate capability at extremely low temperature compared to other ester&#8208;based SMBs), and extended cycle ability (&gt;300 cycles at &#8722;40 &#176;C and 100 cycles at &#8722;60 &#176;C). This work establishes a new paradigm for developing ester&#8208;based electrolytes to address the extreme&#8208;temperature operation challenges of SMBs.

Carbon dots (CDs) with ultra&#8208;narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 29, 32 and 39&#160;nm, and near&#8208;infrared emission at wavelengths of 683, 695 and 704&#160;nm are synthesized. The robust CDs retain narrow&#8208;band emission in harsh conditions, such as in strong acids, alkalis, high temperatures, and organic solvents. CD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes can operate stably at a maximum current of 2000&#160;mA and retain more than 94% of its performance for 150&#160;h at 300&#160;mA.








Abstract
Herein, we report the controllable synthesis of carbon dots (CDs) with high color purity, narrow full width at half maxima (FWHM) of 29, 32 and 39&#160;nm, and near&#8208;infrared emission at wavelengths of 683, 695 and 704&#160;nm. Structural characterization, transient absorption, temperature&#8208;dependent dynamics combined with theoretical calculations were investigated to elucidate the narrowband mechanism. Our results demonstrate that the high symmetry and substantial conjugation of the graphitic core enhance material rigidity with minimal exciton&#8208;capturing defects. The high pyrrole N content increases conjugated electron delocalization, promoting radiative recombination of confined electrons and holes, thereby reducing FWHM. The large exciton binding energy, weak electron&#8208;phonon coupling and simple radiative dynamics of the CDs further contribute to their ultra&#8208;narrow emission bandwidths. The CDs exhibit exceptional photo and thermal stabilities in extremely acidic or alkaline conditions and various organic solvents. No quenching or peak broadening is observed at high CD concentrations, rendering these materials suitable for applications in high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices. Excitingly, CD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) can operate stably at a maximum current of 2000&#160;mA and retain more than 94% of its performance for 150&#160;h at 300&#160;mA. LEDs utilizing these narrowband CDs provide high&#8208;color purity displays and specific steady&#8208;state lighting applications.

         <title>Deciphering&#160;the N&#9472;N Coupling Mechanism Over Iron&#8211;Copper Alloy Catalysts During Ammonia Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In ammonia decomposition, the initial dehydrogenation of adsorbed NH3 and the desorption of nitrogen atoms are two elementary reactions that proceed via competing activation pathways. This study demonstrates that alloying Fe with metals that have a low nitrogen binding energy optimizes the dissociation of NH3 and the binding ability of N* intermediates in the ammonia decomposition reaction process, and new insights are provided for rationally designing Fe&#8208;based catalysts with improved activity and stability.








Abstract
The production of COx&#8208;free hydrogen via the ammonia decomposition reaction (ADR) using Fe&#8208;based non&#8208;precious metal catalysts has attracted much attention. N&#9472;H bond cleavage and N&#9472;N coupling are two key steps in ADR, however, stronger Fe&#9472;N binding leads to lower activity of iron catalysts. Herein, we develop FeCu alloy catalysts with optimized metal&#8208;nitrogen binding energy by incorporating Cu, a metal with inherently weaker nitrogen affinity, into Fe&#8208;based catalysts. The optimized Fe1Cu0.5/MgO catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic performance, achieving an impressive H2 production rate of 139.1&#160;mmol H2 gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 550&#160;&#176;C under a high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV&#160;=&#160;360&#160;000&#160;h&#8722;1). Mechanistic studies reveal that the modulation of the d&#8208;band structure due to the alloying effect optimizes the dissociation of NH3 and the binding ability of N* intermediates in the ADR process. Notably, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) combined with theoretical calculations confirm that FeCu alloying effectively reduces the N&#9472;N recombination energy barrier from 2.25&#160;eV (Fe cluster) to 1.77&#160;eV (FeCu cluster). These findings provide valuable insights for the rational design of highly active Fe&#8208;based catalysts for efficient ammonia decomposition and sustainable hydrogen production.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 550&#160;&#176;C under a high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV&#160;=&#160;360&#160;000&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Mechanistic studies reveal that the modulation of the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band structure due to the alloying effect optimizes the dissociation of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the binding ability of N* intermediates in the ADR process. Notably, in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) combined with theoretical calculations confirm that FeCu alloying effectively reduces the N&#9472;N recombination energy barrier from 2.25&#160;eV (Fe cluster) to 1.77&#160;eV (FeCu cluster). These findings provide valuable insights for the rational design of highly active Fe-based catalysts for efficient ammonia decomposition and sustainable hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anomalous Piezochromic Luminescence in Covalent Triazine Frameworks via Molecular Insertion: Blueshifted and Enhanced Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular insertion in covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) achieves pressure&#8208;induced blueshifted and enhanced emission. Unlike conventional pressure&#8208;responsive &#960;&#8208;systems, where &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and configuration planarization quench emission, inserted molecules suppress quenching and enable anomalous piezochromism. This strategy offers a new route to design piezochromic materials through molecular engineering.








Abstract
Piezochromic materials typically exhibit pressure&#8208;induced redshifted and quenched emission due to enhanced intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and molecular planarization. Consequently, achieving blueshifted and enhanced emission in &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we report anomalous piezochromic luminescence in covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) via molecular insertion. Upon introducing methanol into the nanopores of CTFs, a blueshift in emission from 507.0 to 485.5&#160;nm, accompanied by enhanced intensity, is observed under compression up to 1.22&#160;GPa, distinctly contrasting the redshifted and quenched emission typically observed in compressed pristine CTFs and other crystalline porous materials (CPMs). Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that methanol can weaken the interlayer &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and intralayer conjugation of CTFs by forming weak interactions with CTFs, such as hydrogen bonding, to realize the interlayer slip and intralayer distortions of CTFs, which results in the blueshifted and enhanced emission. This strategy also proves effective with other molecular insertions, offering a general approach to achieving anomalous piezochromic luminescence in CTFs. Our findings establish molecular insertion as a robust method for engineering pressure&#8208;responsive luminescent materials and provide valuable insights for the design of advanced optical sensors and stimuli&#8208;responsive systems.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage C&#9472;N Bond Cleavage Enables Diversification of Multiple Resonance Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work presents a novel synthesis methodology for multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) materials. The selective carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond cleavage of MR frameworks enables the introduction of a wide range of aryl groups that are otherwise difficult to incorporate via conventional borylation methods. This late&#8208;stage functionalization approach boosts the optoelectronic properties of MR materials. As a representative example, DABNA&#8208;dimer exhibited improved EL performance.








Abstract
Recent advances in materials development for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been driven by an emerging design concept known as multiple&#8208;resonance (MR), which provides the benefits of high efficiency and color purity required for commercial OLED displays. Borylation reaction constructing MR frameworks is a key step for developing new &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems, while this reaction includes the limitation of selectivity, making it challenging to control reactions in elaborate molecular structures. Although a wide variety of MR compounds have been prepared through carefully planned synthetic schemes based on retrosynthetic analysis, these tasks typically require significant effort for each individual target. Herein, we demonstrate a successful late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy that enables structural modifications after the borylation reaction, especially in hardly accessible regions in MR structures via carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond cleavage. Our new synthetic method also allows access to new products which were never feasible before. The newly developed material, DABNA&#8208;dimer, proves the impact of late&#8208;stage functionalization on OLED characteristics. The present study serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a diversity&#8208;orientated synthesis in the development of MR materials.

         <title>Reversible Trace&#8208;Water&#8208;Buffering Frameworks for Efficient Humid Methane Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible water&#8208;buffering framework exhibits comparable uptake capacities for both bulky C3H8 and intermediate&#8208;sized C2H6 molecules, realizing the effective purification of natural gas separated from ternary gas mixtures even under 100% relative humidity condition.








Abstract
Trace water is usually fatal to gas separation process because the adsorption sites of adsorbents can be readily devitalized under humid conditions. Here, we develop trace&#8208;water&#8208;buffering porous materials with reversible structural transformation triggered by water adsorption/desorption, achieving exceptional methane purification under humid conditions. Despite the different structures, both the hydrated and dehydrated materials show high adsorption capacities for bulky C3H8 and intermediate&#8208;sized C2H6 molecules but low CH4 uptake. Based on these unique properties, the dehydrated material achieves efficient separation of ternary CH4/C2H6/C3H8 mixtures even under 100% relative humidity, delivering high&#8208;purity CH4 (&gt;99.99%) with a remarkable yield of 7.2 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1. This work sheds light on the designed synthesis of a new generation of microporous materials with reversible water&#8208;buffering performance for gas purification under practically humid conditions.

         <title>Phototransposition of Indazoles to Benzimidazoles: Tautomer&#8208;Dependent Reactivity, Wavelength Dependence, and Continuous Flow Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several N2&#8208;substituted indazole derivatives efficiently undergo photorearrangement to benzimidazoles with UVB irradiation. Motivated by the difference between the wavelength at which the phototransposition is most efficient and the substrate absorbance &#955;max, a photochemical action plot was constructed. Wavelength&#8208;dependent quantum yields were measured, and a photoflow protocol was established to perform the phototransposition on preparative scale.








Abstract
Herein, we report a detailed investigation of the photomediated transformation of indazoles to benzimidazoles through a nitrogen&#8211;carbon transposition. This phototransposition is known to occur in low yield when 1H&#8208;indazoles are subjected to high&#8208;energy UVC irradiation. The 2H&#8208;tautomer of indazole absorbs light more strongly than the 1H&#8208;tautomer at longer wavelengths. We leveraged this improved absorbance profile to develop a general system for the high&#8208;yielding conversion of N2&#8208;derivatized indazoles (prepared from the corresponding 1H&#8208;indazoles) to the corresponding benzimidazoles under UVB or UVA irradiation in up to 98% yield. Investigation of the substrate scope revealed a strong correlation between reaction yield and electron density at N2 of the indazole substrate, suggesting the importance of the availability of the lone pair at this position for reaction efficiency. In addition, evaluation of wavelength&#8208;dependent reactivity through the generation of a photochemical action plot revealed that the highest conversion does not only occur at the substrate's maximum absorbance wavelength but also on its red&#8208;side, enabling the use of longer wavelength irradiation to achieve high yields. Building on these insights, a continuous flow protocol was established that enables the phototransposition on preparative scale.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed 1,5&#8208;Sigma Migratory Ring Expansion of gem&#8208;Difluorodienyl Cyclopropanes and Cyclobutanes</title>

Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1,5&#8208;sigma migratory ring expansions of gem&#8208;difluorodienyl cyclopropanes and gem&#8208;difluorodienyl cyclobutanes enabled the synthesis of challenging seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered carbocycles. Key to these reactions is that gem&#8208;difluorine atoms in the substrates can assist oxidative cyclometallation and detour the difficult reductive elimination through defluorocarbenation, as supported by experiments and DFT calculations.








Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1,5&#8208;sigma migratory ring expansion (SMRE) of common dieneylcyclopropanes (DECPs) and dieneylcyclobutanes (DECBs) fails. But replacing the terminal CH2 group with CF2 group for both DECPs and DECBs, the resulting substrates of gem&#8208;difluorodienyl cyclopropanes (df&#8208;DECPs) and gem&#8208;difluorodienyl cyclobutanes (df&#8208;DECBs) can achieve this reaction, which has broad reaction scope and high efficiency to give seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered carbocycles with a carbonyl group. The keys to the success of this reaction are: oxidative cyclometalation becomes easier with the help of two F atoms; the metallacycle intermediate can detour the sluggish reductive elimination by defluorination to generate Rh carbene intermediate (defluorocarbenation process), which can undergo easier carbene migratory insertion and &#946;&#8208;H elimination, giving rise to the final products. Mechanistic studies via experiments and quantum chemical calculations support the proposed mechanism. The gem&#8208;difluoro ene in the substrates of df&#8208;DECPs and df&#8208;DECBs of the present SMRE reaction can be regarded as a ketene surrogate, and this strategy can be exploited in many transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions in the future.

         <title>Conformational Change in a Four&#8208;Tetrad DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex upon Intercalation of a Small&#8208;Molecule Ligand PyDH2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exception or the rule? This work represents a second observation, and the first crystallographic evidence, of true intercalation of a small&#8208;molecule ligand (here, bisquinolinium PyDH2) into an antiparallel G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA fold.








Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are non&#8208;canonical DNA structures implicated in a number of biological processes. Small&#8208;molecule ligands can alter stability and folding of G4s, which can potentially be exploited for therapeutic purposes. In this work, we investigate the interaction of telomeric DNA fragment from Tetrahymena thermophila (TET25, 5&#8242;&#8208;G(TTGGGG)4&#8208;3&#8242;) with a G4 ligand PyDH2 belonging to the bisquinolinium family. When alone, TET25 adopts a mixture of three conformations, with the most abundant being a four&#8208;tetrad hybrid G4. In the presence of PyDH2, surprisingly, TET25 folds into an antiparallel chair G4, with PyDH2 intercalated between G&#8208;tetrads 2 and 3, according to our crystal structure. The structure represents the second example, and the first crystallographic evidence, of ligand intercalation into a G4. In solution, the interaction of PyDH2 and TET25 leads to a number of complexes differing by G4 topology and binding stoichiometry, strong stabilization of G4 (&#8710;Tm&#160;=&#160;12.4&#160;&#176;C in the presence of one equiv. of PyDH2) and large hysteresis of &#8764;10&#160;&#176;C, suggesting that ligand binding and G4 folding processes are complex.

         <title>Decoupling the SHG&#8208;Birefringence Trade&#8208;off in UV NLO Materials via Triple&#8208;Control Coordination Engineering: Achieving Synergistic Performance Optimization</title>

Our &#8220;triple&#8208;control coordination engineering&#8221; strategy addresses the second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and birefringence trade&#8208;off in ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. We synthesized three zinc halides with enhanced SHG responses. The bromine&#8208;containing compound boasts record&#8208;high SHG coefficients, a wide bandgap, and good thermal stability, making it a promising next&#8208;gen UV NLO material.







Abstract
Decoupling the trade&#8208;off between second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and birefringence (&#916;n) while maintaining a wide bandgap (Eg) is a critical challenge in the field of ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. In this work, we introduce a novel &#8220;triple&#8208;control coordination engineering&#8221; strategy that successfully addresses this challenge. By integrating dihedral angle modulation, coordination mode switching, and polarizability engineering, we have synthesized three zinc halides&#8212;[(C5H6N2O2)(C5H5N2O2)ZnCl (I), (C5H6N2O2)ZnCl2(II), and (C5H6N2O2)ZnBr2 (III)]&#8212;that exhibit exceptional UV NLO performance. Through dynamic C&#9472;C&#9472;N bond rotation, we achieved precise control over the dihedral angle (81&#176;&#8594;84&#176;), effectively modulating optical anisotropy (&#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.048&#8211;0.071@1064&#160;nm). pH/temperature&#8208;driven coordination mode evolution enabled complete alignment of the [ZnO2X2] polyhedron, while halogen substitution (Cl &#8594; Br) amplified polarizability gradients. These advancements resulted in a stepwise amplified SHG response (0.4&#8594;3.5&#8594;8.2&#160;&#215;&#160;KH2PO4, abbreviated as KDP), controlled &#916;n, wide Eg (&gt;5.0&#160;eV), and remarkable thermal stability (&gt;250 &#176;C). Notably, (C5H6N2O2)ZnBr2 stands out as the first zinc&#8208;based halide to simultaneously achieve large SHG (&gt;8&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP), moderate birefringence (0.05&lt;&#916;n&#160;&lt;&#160;0.1), and a wide bandgap (Eg&#160;&gt;&#160;5.0&#160;eV). This work not only provides a paradigm&#8208;shifting approach to materials design but also paves the way for the development of UV NLO materials with superior comprehensive performance.

         <title>HF&#8208;Free Manufacturing of Fluorochemicals from Fluorspar</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hazardous production of HF poses a major chemical and societal challenge. How to incorporate fluorine (F) atoms into organic molecules, circumventing HF generation? Recently, Gouverneur and co&#8208;workers reported an innovative method to activate fluorspar (CaF2), mitigating the environmental impact of the fluorination process.








Abstract
Fluorochemicals are vital in modern chemistry, from batteries to agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. However, their production still relies on a centuries&#8208;old method involving the production of hydrofluoric acid (HF). Recently, Gouverneur and co&#8208;workers developed innovative, and more sustainable approaches starting from naturally occurring fluorspar (CaF&#8322;), reducing environmental impact.

         <dc:description>
Ammonia synthesis from nitrate polluted water offers the opportunity for simultaneous water decontamination and developing decentralized and sustainable ammonia production. As highlighted in this cover artwork, the implemented Joule&#8211;Stripping strategy is a novel and highly effective method to directly recover the produced ammonia from the aqueous solution by utilizing the in situ generated heat during electrocatalysis, which has so far been a great challenge in the overall process. Details are reported by Victor Mougel et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202504174).

Multiple resonance (MR) emitters play a pivotal role in recent advances in optoelectronics. However, conventional synthetic approaches to MR frameworks have intrinsic limitations in site&#8208;selectivity. In their Research Article (e202509606), Takuji Hatakeyama et&#160;al. demonstrate that previously inaccessible positions in MR frameworks can now be unlocked through late&#8208;stage C&#9472;N bond cleavage. This breakthrough, symbolized by the opening treasure chest on the cover, opens new pathways for designing advanced MR materials with greater molecular diversity and flexibility.

Enzyme&#8208;mediated divergent reactions are yielding an identical product, symbolizing &#8220;All roads lead to Rome&#8221;. In their Research Article (e202506614), Shengying Li and co&#8208;workers highlight novel degradation routes of carboxyl&#8208;free aromatic environmental pollutants mediated by CYP152 peroxygenases, using H2O and H2O2 to converge structurally diverse substrates into a single catechol product via two distinct mechanisms, exemplifying enzymatic versatility.

         <title>Technoeconomic Perspective on the Electroreduction of CO2 to Formic Acid: Scale&#8208;Up Strategies Toward Industrial Viability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current technoeconomic analysis of CO2 electroreduction to produce &#8220;green&#8221; formic acid highlights economic optimization through the implementation of multiple&#8208;cell stacking, positioning it as a competitive alternative to established industrial methods. Among the studied electrolyzer reactors, the direct formic acid production electrolyzer demonstrates enhanced viability due to the reduced costs associated with downstream processing.








Abstract
The conventional industrial synthesis of formic acid is an energy&#8208;intensive process that contributes to the CO2 footprint. As an alternative method, the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (eCO2RR) to formic acid has emerged as a viable means to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations and advance the energy transition to a circular, carbon&#8208;neutral economy. Despite considerable progress in this field, the scale&#8208;up of electrolyzers from laboratory prototypes to commercial&#8208;scale production remains an important challenge. Thus, this technoeconomic analysis provides a detailed evaluation of the economic viability of upscaling the electrolyzer size to an industrial level, determining whether the eCO2RR process can economically compete with the conventional industrial production of formic acid. The proposed technoeconomic assessment employs a bottom&#8208;up approach based on realistic cost models using the three most successful designs: dual flow (DF), direct formic acid production (DFAP), and zero&#8208;gap (ZG) electrolyzers. The results from this study underscore the necessity of implementing multiple&#8208;cell stacking to economically compete with established industrial processes. Among the three studied designs, DFAP and, to a certain extent, DF are promising. Although the scalability of the DFAP electrolyzer may initially appear inadequate, it holds potential for commercial application, particularly if technical improvements in the center compartment and solid&#8208;state electrolyte are materialized.

         <title>ABC&#8208;seq Expands Small RNAs Profiling with Successive Nucleic Acid Structure&#8208;Differentiated Enzymatic Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce ABC&#8208;seq, a versatile smRNA&#8208;seq method addressing challenges in library construction, such as adapter ligation biases, dimer byproducts, and amplification bias. ABC&#8208;seq employs successive enhanced recognition for smRNAs and integrates randomized adapters as UMIs for precise quantification, leveraging nucleic acid structural differences between smRNAs libraries and adapter dimers, supported by robust validation and biological data.








Abstract
Small RNAs (smRNAs) play crucial roles in gene regulation, but current sequencing methods face a set of tangled challenges, including adapter ligation bias, high adapter dimer byproducts, and amplification variability, which limit their capacity to fully capture smRNA diversity. Here, we develop ABC&#8208;seq, a general strategy to enhance smRNA recognition through successive structure&#8208;differentiated recognition. We designed two randomized adapters, each containing a restriction enzyme recognition motif or a cleavage site. Then, we operate two product structure&#8208;differentiated enzymatic reactions to maximally suppress randomized adapter dimer. Furthermore, the randomized sequence in adapters serves as unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) in smRNA&#8208;seq data analysis to correct amplification bias and improves quantification accuracy. Using ABC&#8208;seq, we identified a wider range of smRNAs, including miRNAs, scRNAs, and snoRNAs, in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes, detecting 9.4% more miRNAs compared to traditional methods. Additionally, ABC&#8208;seq revealed smRNAs associated with cancer drug responses and their roles in immune modulation in non&#8208;small cell lung cancer. ABC&#8208;seq expands the smRNA landscape and offers new insights into complex gene regulatory networks.

         <title>A Resonance Hybrid Design for Stable Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A resonance hybrid phenazine derivative (HSPC) is demonstrated for stable aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). By distributing redox centers across conjugated resonance forms, HSPC mitigates chemical degradation, achieving a low capacity decay (0.0009% per cycle, 0.006% per day) at 1.4 M electron concentration in AORFB applications. This work introduces a framework for designing durable organic energy storage materials through resonance hybridization, advancing sustainable battery technologies.








Abstract
Organic molecules are promising candidates for aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) due to their structural versatility, tunability, and reliance on earth&#8208;abundant elements for sustainable energy storage solutions. However, achieving stability for organic molecules in aqueous batteries remains challenging due to water&#8208;induced degradation. The conjugated systems with enhanced rigidity, such as anthraquinone or phenazine derivatives, have shown improved stability, yet often exhibit unwanted restructuring reactions in the reduced state&#160;due to overly high electron densities, leading to the loss of redox activity. In the present work, we introduce a resonance hybrid, 2,3&#8208;dihydroxyl substituted phenazine dication (HSPC), whose redox center is distributed among different resonance forms between phenazine and quinone to enable efficient reversible electron transfer in aqueous environments. The electrochemical synthesis, resonance structure, and key properties of HSPC were investigated through a framework of combined electrochemical measurements, spectroscopic analysis, and theoretical studies. A 1.4&#160;M electron concentration cell based on HSPC exhibits a low capacity decay rate of 0.0009% per cycle, 0.006% per day. These results indicate the significant potential of the resonance hybrid design to build stable redox materials for AORFBs and other energy storage applications.

         <title>Surfactants Screen Slide Electrification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>

Spontaneous charging of moving water drops on hydrophobic surfaces is reduced by the addition of surfactant. The addition of surfactants can (1) reduce the adsorption of primary anions to the solid&#8208;liquid interface, (2) increase the transfer of primary anions to the liquid surface, and (3) co&#8208;deposit cationic surfactants.








Abstract
Water drops spontaneously accumulate charges when they move on hydrophobic dielectric surfaces by slide electrification. Slide electrification generates electricity with possible applications on tiny devices. The potential of up to 1&#160;KV generated by slide electrification alters wetting and drop motion. Therefore, it is important to know the factors that affect slide electrification. To find out how surfactants affect slide electrification, we measured drop charges of aqueous drops containing cationic CTAB, anionic SDS, and neutral C8E3 sliding on different hydrophobic surfaces. The result is: addition of surfactant significantly reduces the spontaneous charging of moving water drops. Based on zeta potential measurements, confocal microscopy of deposited surface&#8208;active dyes and drop impact studies, we propose that several factors contribute to this suppression of charge separation: (1) Surfactants tend to lower the contact angles, which reduces charge separation. (2) Surfactant adsorption at the solid&#8208;liquid interface can reduce the density of primary ions, particularly for anionic surfactants. (3) Anionic and neutral surfactants are mostly transferred to the liquid&#8208;air interface at the rear of the sliding drop, retaining primary ions within the drop. (4) Deposited cationic surfactant directly reduces the charge of the drop.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Parallel Synthesis of Photocleavable Bifunctional Molecules Enables Efficient Phenotypic Protein Degrader Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated platform enables efficient parallel solid&#8208;phase synthesis of diverse, photocleavable CRBN&#8208;focused degrader libraries. Direct&#8208;to&#8208;biology (D2B) phenotypic screening, incorporating mechanism controls, allows reliable hit identification without extensive purification, exemplified by discovery of a novel GSPT1 degrader. This versatile strategy facilitates direct&#8208;to&#8208;phenotype screening with broad applicability in TPD research.








Abstract
Phenotypic screening offers an effective path for discovering protein degraders, particularly targeting proteins that are poorly characterized or lack sufficient ligand&#8208;binding information. Nonetheless, phenotypic protein degrader discovery (PPDD) faces practical hurdles, such as synthetic complexity in generating chemically diverse libraries and difficulties in reliably identifying degradation&#8208;driven phenotypes in direct&#8208;to&#8208;biology (D2B) assays. In response to these challenges, we developed an integrated PPDD platform that combines optimized solid&#8208;phase parallel synthesis with a robust D2B screening workflow. Leveraging photocleavable linkers and versatile synthetic strategies, this platform facilitates rapid generation of chemically diverse, ready&#8208;to&#8208;screen bifunctional molecule libraries requiring minimal purification. As a proof of concept, we synthesized and phenotypically screened 130 cereblon&#8208;recruiting molecules, leading to several promising protein degradation&#8208;dependent hits. Subsequent hit optimization and target identification validated compound 12&#8211;60 as a structurally novel GSPT1 degrader with compelling cellular activity. Overall, our integrated platform represents an efficient and practical toolkit for PPDD, establishing a versatile foundation to accelerate future campaigns and expand the degradable proteome.

         <title>Suppressing the Interface Photodegradation towards Efficient and Stable All Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric multi&#8208;dentate anchoring strategy was employed to realise the reinforced and homogeneous anchorage by multiple repeat phosphonic acid groups onto NiOx, suppressing unfavourable interfacial reactions and alleviating phase segregation of wide bandgap perovskite, thus delivering a champion efficiency up to 28.51% for all perovskite tandem solar cells with better device operation photostability.








Abstract
All perovskite tandem solar cells (PTSCs) were expected to overcome the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit of single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Nevertheless, wide bandgap (WBG) subcells suffer from large photovoltage loss and device instability due to extensive film defect, interfacial degradation and phase segregation. Herein, a polymeric multi&#8208;dentate anchoring (PMDA) strategy by introducing poly(carbazole phosphonic acid) was employed to engineer the bottom interface and suppress phase segregation. The reinforced and homogeneous anchorage by multiple repeat phosphonic acid groups onto NiOx significantly optimised the bottom interface, suppressing unfavourable interfacial reactions and thus alleviating phase segregation of WBG perovskite. As a result, the PMDA&#8208;modified WBG PSCs showed higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the control device (19.84% vs. 18.18%), along with better device photostability (T80&#160;=&#160;1200 vs. 500 h). Coupled with narrow bandgap (NBG) PSCs, the PMDA&#8208;modified PTSCs reached a PCE of up to 28.51% with device operation photostability over 700 h (T80).

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directed Supramolecular Organic Semiconductor Thin Films Realized via Thermal Precursor Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;directed supramolecular semiconductor thin films are realized by a thermal precursor approach. The precursor film is formed via solution processes and thermally converted to the target semiconductor film. This versatile strategy enables the fabrication of supramolecularly controlled thin films composed of insoluble molecules like &#960;&#8208;extended molecules with multiple hydrogen bonding sites.








Abstract
Flexible organic semiconductors are regarded as an important class of functional materials, enabling their fabrication via a solution&#8208;processed method. However, supramolecularly designed organic thin&#8208;film transistor (OTFT) devices using hydrogen bonds have not been sufficiently developed. This is because of the reduced solubility caused by introducing hydrogen bond sites and the difficulty in controlling molecular orientations and packing structures. Herein, we report a reasonable strategy for the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded semiconductor thin films of a tetrabenzoporphyrin derivative with amide groups using the thermal precursor approach. The thin films are successfully fabricated by thermal conversion of the corresponding precursor in the film state. Assembly structure with a hydrogen&#8208;bond network is revealed by the combination of X&#8208;ray diffraction and infrared p&#8208;polarized multiple&#8208;angle incidence resolution spectrometry. The OTFT devices exhibit high hole mobility of 0.25 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 among hydrogen&#8208;bonded OTFTs reported previously. Notably, we unveiled the high thermal stability of semiconductor films without decreasing device performance in air up to 250&#160;&#176;C. This strategy can become a key methodology to form hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;directed organic electronic devices, namely supramolecular devices.

         <title>Cu2O Nano&#8208;Homojunction for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we demonstrate the highly selective, active, and long&#8208;term durable electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to ethylene by a nano&#8208;homojunction structure of Cu2O, which can greatly improve CO2 adsorption, enrich the key intermediates by co&#8208;adsorbing *CObridge and *COatop and facilitate C&#9472;C coupling step.








Abstract
The efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction into value&#8208;added multi&#8208;carbon products is of great importance and remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the highly selective, active, and long&#8208;term durable electrocatalytic production of ethylene from CO2 by constructing a Cu2O nano&#8208;homojunction, which is composed of Cu2O nanocubes in size of &#8776;100&#160;nm and the surface&#8208;adhered Cu2O nanodots in size of &#8776;12&#160;nm, as electrocatalyst. The maximum Faradaic efficiency of ethylene can reach 73.7% at&#160;&#8722;1.4&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in H&#8208;type cell, with partial current density to ethylene of 38.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, it can work stably for more than 200&#160;h at 0.31 A cm&#8722;2 in membrane electrode assembly. The mechanism for the high selectivity, activity and stability for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene conversion was investigated by in situ experiments and theoretical calculations. The results reveal that such a catalyst is efficient in adsorbing CO2, stabilizing the key intermediate *CO, and facilitating both the *CO protonation to form *CHO and the subsequent *CO&#8208;*CHO coupling for ethylene formation.

&lt;p&gt;Here we demonstrate the highly selective, active, and long-term durable electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to ethylene by a nano-homojunction structure of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which can greatly improve CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption, enrich the key intermediates by co-adsorbing &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;bridge&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;atop&lt;/sub&gt; and facilitate C&#9472;C coupling step.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficient electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction into value-added multi-carbon products is of great importance and remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the highly selective, active, and long-term durable electrocatalytic production of ethylene from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by constructing a Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O nano-homojunction, which is composed of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O nanocubes in size of &#8776;100&#160;nm and the surface-adhered Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O nanodots in size of &#8776;12&#160;nm, as electrocatalyst. The maximum Faradaic efficiency of ethylene can reach 73.7% at&#160;&#8722;1.4&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in H-type cell, with partial current density to ethylene of 38.2&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, it can work stably for more than 200&#160;h at 0.31 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in membrane electrode assembly. The mechanism for the high selectivity, activity and stability for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-ethylene conversion was investigated by in situ experiments and theoretical calculations. The results reveal that such a catalyst is efficient in adsorbing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, stabilizing the key intermediate &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CO, and facilitating both the &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CO protonation to form &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CHO and the subsequent &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CO-&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CHO coupling for ethylene formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Material Recycling/Upcycling of Polyamide Waste Enabled by Cosolvent&#8208;Tunable Dissolution Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Physical recycling of polyamides (PAs) requires high temperatures due to solvent resistance. Rapid dissolution of PAs in formic acid (FA) using a cosolvent strategy enables room&#8208;temperature recycling and upcycling for utilization of high&#8208;value resources. The weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonding nature of the cosolvent regulates FA's cluster formation and enhances solvation of crystalline PA.








Abstract
Polyamides (PAs, nylons) are a ubiquitous class of high&#8208;performance plastics used extensively in a wide range of applications. Their high resistance to many common solvents and tendency to hydrolyze in strong acids or bases creates a major hurdle to low&#8208;emissions material recycling (i.e., resource separation and recovery). In the present study, the first detailed investigation into the molecular mechanisms of polyamide dissolution, we show that introducing a weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonding cosolvent into formic acid can effectively tune the solvent&#8211;solvent and solvent&#8211;polymer interactions, drastically accelerates the room&#8208;temperature dissolution kinetics of common (short&#8208;chain) polyamides such as PA6 and PA66, as well as long&#8208;chain and semi&#8208;aromatic varieties. The recovered polymers show no change in their chemical structures or properties, and sufficient selectivity allows for fillers such as short and long fibers, inorganic nanoparticles, metals, and other mixed polymer phases to be recovered at high efficiency (&gt;95%) along with recirculation of all solvents (&gt;98%). This cosolvent&#8208;enabled approach has the potential to make polyamide recycling more sustainable and economical by reducing the energy input and CO2 emissions required to separate and recover the various constituent materials from automotive and electrical components, textiles, and beyond.

         <title>Dissected MACl Involved Reaction Pathway for Low Temperature Fabrication of High&#8208;Efficiency Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Reaction pathways from lead iodide (PbI2) to intermediate phases (firstly dissected) and subsequent transformation of pure &#945;&#8208;phase perovskite at low annealing temperature have been optimized via a novel methylammonium chloride (MACl) vapor assistance approach. Moreover, temperature&#8208;dependent residual stress and cation reaction competition have been resolved thoroughly. The target flexible perovskite solar cell (f&#8208;PVSC) achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.46% (best efficiency at 100 &#176;C) with excellent long&#8208;term and mechanical stabilities.








Abstract
FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) are highly promising due to their excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the formation of stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 requires annealing at a temperature of at least 150 &#176;C, which can induce significant residual stress and make the process incompatible with plastic substrates, resulting in poor crystal quality and compromised mechanical properties. To address these issues, we present a novel approach using methylammonium chloride (MACl) vapor&#8208;assisted lead iodide (PbI2) to form homogeneous intermediate phases (MAPbCl3 and Pb3I8). This method optimizes the reaction pathway; accordingly pure &#945;&#8208;phase perovskite can be completely formed at 100 &#176;C, contrasting with conventional MACl component engineering in organic amine salt solution. We have intensively deciphered the reaction pathway leading to intermediate phase formation, as well as the nucleation and phase transition processes into the photoactive perovskite at 100 &#176;C. Additionally, we have conducted a comprehensive study on temperature&#8208;dependent residual stress and cation reaction competition, meanwhile extensively dissecting the competitive implication of interface mismatch and lattice defects leading to residual stress and cation component inhomogeneity. Consequently, the modified flexible&#8208;PVSCs have achieved a remarkable efficiency of 24.46% (25.50% for rigid PVSCs). The devices also exhibit significantly improved long&#8208;term and mechanical stability.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free Detection of Virus&#8208;Membrane Interactions Using Surface&#8208;Enhanced Infrared Absorption (SEIRA) Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
Viral binding and fusion are early steps during viral infection. Surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy enables the label&#8208;free tracking of molecular events, as the influenza A virus interacts with a host cell model membrane, providing chemical resolution for viral proteins, viral lipids, and host lipids.








Abstract
Viral binding and membrane fusion are essential steps in viral infection, mediated by viral proteins that bind to host cell receptors and facilitate the fusion between viral and host membranes. Targeting these steps for the development of new antiviral strategies requires methods that enable investigating virus&#8208;membrane interactions under in&#8208;situ conditions, while providing mechanistic insights on a molecular level. Here, we demonstrate the use of surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy combined with tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs) for the label&#8208;free detection of virus&#8208;membrane interactions, using the Influenza A/X&#8208;31 virus (IAV) as a model. Exploiting the nanometer&#8208;scale surface&#8208;sensitivity of SEIRA, we detect the vibrational fingerprint of IAV's hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein, as it specifically binds to sialic acid receptors of the ganglioside GD1a in the tBLM, mimicking the host membrane. Triggering viral fusion via a pH change, we identify structural changes of HA engaging with the host membrane model. Moreover, by constructing the tBLM from deuterated lipids, we utilize the vibrational isotope effect and distinguish between viral and model membrane, providing a basis to track lipid mixing. This approach establishes a powerful tool for spectroscopic studies of the function and inhibition of viral proteins, while still embedded in intact virus particles.

         <title>Methanol&#8208;Facilitated Cascaded Polyolefin Upcycling Enabling the Efficient Generation of High&#8208;Value C9+ Alkylaromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy that utilizes methanol as a coreactant to upcycle polyolefins into valuable C9&#8211;C12 alkylaromatics using a simple heterogeneous catalyst. The methodology leverages methanol's dual function: promoting carbocation&#8208;mediated C&#9472;C bond cleavage and facilitating the self&#8208;amplifying Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reactions. Combined aliphatic and high&#8208;value aromatic products, our strategy elevates the overall economic potential of the product portfolios.








Abstract
Existing polyolefin chemical recycling and upcycling strategies predominantly yield fuels, waxes, and olefins, which are characterized by relatively low economic value. Although attempts have been made to synthesize functionalized chemicals, a particularly promising product category&#8212;C9&#8208;C12 polysubstituted alkylbenzenes with a market price exceeding 1400 USD per ton&#8212;remains largely overlooked. Herein, we present a novel methodology that utilizes methanol as a&#160;coreactant, with the goal of achieving high&#8208;yield synthesis of polysubstituted alkylbenzenes. Under mild reaction conditions (280&#160;&#176;C), the process attains a 97.8% conversion rate of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE, Mw&#160;=&#160;300&#160;kDa) and complete conversion of methanol. Based on the mass of polyethylene, it produces 37&#160;wt% of aromatic products, accompanied by an 87% increase in the mass yield of C9&#8211;C12 alkylbenzenes. Isotope&#8208;labeling experiments conducted with 13CH3OH and in situ FTIR disclose that methanol acts synergistically to promote carbocation&#8208;mediated C&#9472;C bond cleavage and self&#8208;amplifying Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reactions. This mechanism steers the methylative homologation pathway toward the formation of polymethylated aromatics. The versatility of this approach, which is applicable to a wide variety of polyolefins, holds the promise of opening new pathways for a profitable circular economy in the plastics industry.

Although attempts have been made to synthesize functionalized chemicals, a particularly promising product category&#8212;C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; polysubstituted alkylbenzenes with a market price exceeding 1400 USD per ton&#8212;remains largely overlooked. Herein, we present a novel methodology that utilizes methanol as a&#160;coreactant, with the goal of achieving high-yield synthesis of polysubstituted alkylbenzenes. Under mild reaction conditions (280&#160;&#176;C), the process attains a 97.8% conversion rate of low-density polyethylene (LDPE, &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;300&#160;kDa) and complete conversion of methanol. Based on the mass of polyethylene, it produces 37&#160;wt% of aromatic products, accompanied by an 87% increase in the mass yield of C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; alkylbenzenes. Isotope-labeling experiments conducted with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH and in situ FTIR disclose that methanol acts synergistically to promote carbocation-mediated C&#9472;C bond cleavage and self-amplifying Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reactions. This mechanism steers the methylative homologation pathway toward the formation of polymethylated aromatics. The versatility of this approach, which is applicable to a wide variety of polyolefins, holds the promise of opening new pathways for a profitable circular economy in the plastics industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Incorporation of Dye&#8208;Derived Carbon Dots Into Carbon Nitride Nanosheets for Enhanced Photoinduced Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NCD@CN heterojunctions, which integrated dye&#8208;derived carbon dots into nitrogen&#8208;deficient carbon nitride nanosheets, not only preserved an ultrafast reaction rate for photo&#8208;ATRP and produced well&#8208;structured polymers with narrow dispersity but also facilitated easy separation and effective recyclability in cascade polymerizations.








Abstract
Carbon dots have made significant advancements in photoinduced atom transfer radical polymerization (photo&#8208;ATRP), achieving ultrafast reaction rates and precise control over the resulting polymers. However, their ultrasmall size necessitates time&#8208;consuming and resource&#8208;intensive purification steps, which can ultimately lead to undesirable product contamination. In this study, we integrated dye&#8208;derived carbon dots (NCD) into nitrogen&#8208;deficient carbon nitride (CN) nanosheets via a hydrothermal process, forming NCD@CN heterojunctions with an expanded delocalized heterocyclic structure, enhanced specific surface area, and improved light absorption. The chemical linkages between the two components created NCD@CN heterojunctions, which improved interfacial interactions and promoted efficient charge transfer. The NCD@CN heterojunctions demonstrated ultrahigh activity, comparable to the NCD precursors, achieving a turnover number up to 1780 and a turnover frequency up to 59.3&#160;min&#8722;1. This led to the production of polymers with tailor&#8208;made structures, predicted molecular weights, and narrow dispersities. Additionally, they enabled complete catalyst recovery across multiple polymerization cycles. The incorporation of NCD into CN nanosheets affords new territory for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts at the atomic level and provides alternative pathways for ultrafast photo&#8208;ATRP processes.

         <title>Mechanistic Promiscuity in Cobalt&#8208;Mediated CO2 Reduction Reaction: One&#8208; Versus Two&#8208;Electron Reduction Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cobalt complexes [(Hbbpya)CoII]2&#8314;, and [(Mebbpya)CoII]2&#8314; show contrasting CO&#8322; reduction behaviors. [(Hbbpya)CoII]2&#8314; selectively forms CO via a fast, two&#8208;electron pathway aided by a &#8208;NH proton relay, while [(Mebbpya)CoII]2&#8314; favours hydrogen evolution due to a slower, competitive one&#8208;electron mechanism. Stopped&#8208;flow studies reveal a reactive CO&#8322; radical anion, offering insights into their distinct catalytic pathways.








Abstract
We compare the carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) activity and selectivity of the complexes [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+ and [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+, which contain two 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine chelating groups linked by &#8208;NH or &#8208;NCH3 moieties, respectively. Whereas [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+ forms CO under electrocatalytic conditions in presence of phenol (PhOH) with high selectivity, [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+ shows higher hydrogen evolution reaction activity and low selectivity for CO production. The molecular origin of the difference in product selectivity was analysed based on spectroscopic trapping of reactive intermediates and detailed kinetic and theoretical studies. A difference in mechanism is evident; whereas an efficient proton relay mediated by the &#8208;NH group initiates a two&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 in the case of [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+, one&#8208;electron chemistry prevails for [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+. Under stopped&#8208;flow conditions, we trapped the one&#8208;electron reduced CO2 radical anion in [(Mebbpya)CoI(CO2&#8722;&#8226;)], which forms oxalate under aprotic conditions. This study underlines the importance of subtle electronic and protonation changes in controlling the CO2RR product selectivity.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Activated Single&#8208;Metal&#8208;Site Catalysts Break Adsorption&#8208;Energy Scaling Relations for Robust Bifunctional Oxygen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of boron&#8208;mediated single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalyst has been explored by coupling metal&#8211;carbon coordination with additional boron doping. Atomically&#8208;dispersed CoC4B&#7530; moieties were identified as unique bifunctional active center that breaks the usual scaling relations to implement an almost impossible mission of boosting inherent OER and ORR activities simultaneously beyond the theoretical limit for single metal site in a single catalyst.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic oxygen evolution and reduction reaction (OER/ORR) catalysts are paramount to many renewable energy technologies. Atomically&#8208;dispersed transition&#8208;metal catalysts are compelling alternatives to current dominant noble&#8208;metal catalysts, yet they often show inadequate activity for OER and insufficient durability in practical battery operations. Here, we show a rational methodology that enables single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalyst to break universal adsorption&#8208;energy scaling limitations for both OER/ORR and push bifunctional catalytic performance of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dominated catalysts to unprecedented level. Other than metal&#8211;nitrogen coordination, the newly&#8208;designed catalyst (namely metal&#8208;C&#8208;B) stabilizes atomic metals on B&#8208;doped carbon via metal&#8211;carbon coordination and afford favorable electronic engineering. The optimized Co&#8208;C&#8208;B catalyst in base exhibits a record&#8208;low OER overpotential of 172 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a superior ORR half&#8208;wave potential of 0.87 V with robust stability over 500 h of continuous OER or ORR, which endows a rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery with over 6755 charge/discharge cycles. The delivered mass activities of 33941&#160;A&#160;gmetal&#8722;1 for OER and 15873 A gmetal&#8722;1 for ORR are respectively &#8764;112/80&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial noble&#8208;metal counterparts. Atomically&#8208;dispersed CoC4B&#7530; moieties were theoretically identified as unique bifunctional active centers, breaking usual scaling relations of intermediates adsorption and boosting inherent OER/ORR activities simultaneously beyond theoretical limitations for single metal site.

         <title>Is Phenylnitrene a Missing Link in the Formation of Polycyclic Aromatic Nitrogen Heterocycles?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new formation pathway for polycyclic aromatic nitrogen heterocycles (PANHs) has been found. The reaction of phenylnitrene and the propargyl radical leads to quinoline, proving that nitrenes are suitable precursors for nitrogen incorporation mechanisms. We use double imaging photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy to identify the products and quantum chemistry to explore the mechanism in detail. 








Abstract
The incorporation of heteroatoms into the framework of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), in particular of nitrogen to yield polycyclic aromatic nitrogen heterocycles (PANHs), has been proposed for both astronomical and combustion environments, but no suitable precursors and pathways have been found. Analogous pathways to PAH formation are kinetically or energetically inhibited in the presence of a nitrogen heteroatom. We report on the reaction of phenylnitrene (3PhN, c&#8208;C6H5N) with resonance&#8208;stabilized propargyl radicals (C3H3) and find that the association reaction bifurcates depending on the orientation of the attacking propargyl radical and yields multiple isomeric products. Among them, we identify the condensed&#8208;ring quinoline and conclude that nitrenes are viable candidates to drive the formation of PANHs.

&lt;p&gt;A new formation pathway for polycyclic aromatic nitrogen heterocycles (PANHs) has been found. The reaction of phenylnitrene and the propargyl radical leads to quinoline, proving that nitrenes are suitable precursors for nitrogen incorporation mechanisms. We use double imaging photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy to identify the products and quantum chemistry to explore the mechanism in detail.

         <title>Harmonizing Nanoparticle Exsolution From Ce&#8211;Sm Oxide Matrix for Stable Methane Dry Reforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of moderately exsolved Rh nanoparticles was achieved on the catalyst surface through exsolution from the Ce&#8211;Sm oxide matrix. Due to the balanced metal&#8208;support interaction, the catalyst shows antisintering and coke&#8208;resistant performance in the methane dry reforming stability test.








Abstract
Catalyst deactivation hinders the application of high&#8208;temperature catalysis such as methane dry reforming, where nanoparticle exsolution will likely clear the path. However, the harsh reaction conditions often easily unbalance the exsolution degree, leading to either sintering or insufficient exsolution of metal nanoparticles. Here, we achieve the fabrication of highly dispersed yet exposed Rh nanoparticles exsolved from the Ce&#8211;Sm oxide matrix. Starting from examining the metal&#8208;support interaction of Rh&#8211;CeO2 and Rh&#8211;Sm2O3, the exsolution dynamics of Rh nanoparticles are studied via multiple in situ techniques. Rapid exsolution from CeO2 induces Rh sintering and catalytic deactivation, whereas sluggish exsolution from Sm2O3 results in Rh encapsulation with poor activity. The balanced metal&#8208;support interaction harmonizes the exsolution of Rh nanoparticles from the Ce&#8211;Sm oxide matrix, fabricating an antisintering and coke&#8208;resistant catalyst for methane dry reforming. This work provides insights into the development of catalysts with structural robustness, where the essence lies in the engineering of nanoparticle exsolution.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance FeP Catalyst for Electrochemical Ammonia Production and Recovery via Joule&#8208;Stripping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrodeposited high&#8208;surface&#8208;area FeP is introduced as a highly active, selective, and stable catalyst for nitrate reduction in alkaline media. Exploiting the high stability of the catalyst in alkaline media, a novel Joule&#8208;stripping strategy is implemented to recover the produced ammonia as solid ammonium salt, using the heat generated at high current densities to directly volatilize and separate in situ formed ammonia from the aqueous solution. 








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO&#8323;RR) offers a promising route for decentralized and sustainable ammonia production while addressing environmental challenges associated with nitrate pollution. However, the development of practical implementations has been slowed by the challenge of creating highly stable and selective catalysts for strongly basic environments, along with the difficulty of efficiently recovering ammonia from dilute solutions. Here, we introduce a partially oxidized amorphous iron&#8208;phosphide (POA&#8208;FeP) electrocatalyst that combines high activity and stability with an innovative Joule&#8208;stripping strategy for ammonia recovery. Electrodeposited onto nickel foam (NF), the POA&#8208;FeP catalyst achieves benchmark partial current densities of &#8722;720&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in neutral media and &#8722;932&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media, and near quantitative Faradaic efficiencies (FE). The robustness of the POA&#8208;FeP/NF catalyst was highlighted by its ability to maintain FE above 90% during continuous operation for over 1000 h at a total current density of &#8722;300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. We demonstrate that the Joule heating resulting from the operation of the electrolyzer at high current density can be exploited to induce the volatilization of ammonia, which can then be recovered as solid ammonium chloride with &gt;95% yield. This integrated Joule&#8208;stripping approach simplifies ammonia recovery and opens up new possibilities for scalable and energy&#8208;efficient nitrate reduction systems.

         <title>Splicing Them Together: Construction of Polyoxovanadate&#8211;Organic Polyhedra&#8208;Based Pyrgoscages and Catenanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drawing inspiration from pyrgoscages and catenanes, we have adopted synthetic strategies of pivot construction and polyhedral interlocking to splice a pair of tetrahedral polyoxovanadate&#8211;organic polyhedra to form hourglass&#8208;shaped dimers at nanoscale. The close communication of the nanomodules has been achieved via both covalent and non&#8208;covalent binding and is associated with the unique ability for NH3 adsorption. 








Abstract
Following the construction schemes of pyrgoscages and catenanes, attempts to splice polyoxovanadate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (POV&#8208;MOPs) together have been carried out in this work. To meet the requirements of POV&#8208;MOPs with varied sizes, synthetic strategies including reconstruction of original vertex, introduction of exogenous vertex, and initiative of polyhedral interlock have been developed, which successfully integrated a pair of tetrahedral monomers into an hourglass&#8208;shaped dimer. On top of this, several structuring principles, such as anisotropic enhancement, electrostatic potential reduction, and sufficient intramolecular support, can be drawn from here and popularized to the related MOP systems. Thanks to the advent of such splicing techniques managed by both covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions, the close communication of POV&#8208;MOPs has afforded not only the unprecedented structural archetypes, but the unique behaviors for NH3 adsorption as well.

         <title>Thiotemplated Polyketide Chain Fusion and Reductive Cyclization Build the Reactive Butenolide Core of Malleicyprol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Malleicyprol, a virulence factor of notorious animal and human pathogens of the Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP) group, results from the fusion of two individual polyketide chains. The noncanonical condensation domain of the PKS&#8211;NRPS hybrid synthetase BurF forms an ester bond, and the terminal reductase domain mediates a reductive chain release followed by ring formation. Biomimetic synthesis of malleicyprol confirms the feasibility of the proposed Knoevenagel&#8208;type intramolecular cyclization process that forms the butenolide ring.








Abstract
Malleicyprol, a virulence factor of notorious animal and human pathogens of the Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP) group, features a molecular cyclopropanol warhead linked to a reactive butenolide core. Biosynthetic considerations suggested that this heterocycle was formed by the merger of two individual polyketide chains, but the precise mechanism has remained elusive. By combining chemical synthesis, complete in vitro reconstitution of the biotransformation, and mutational analysis, we show that two individually generated polyketide chains are joined by a noncanonical condensation domain of the PKS&#8211;NRPS hybrid synthetase BurF, which forms an ester bond. By mutagenesis, biochemical assays, and trapping of the aldehyde generated from a substrate surrogate, we found that the terminal reductase domain mediates a reductive chain release with concomitant ring formation. The feasibility of the proposed Knoevenagel&#8208;type intramolecular cyclization into the butenolide moiety was confirmed by a biomimetic synthesis of malleicyprol. The elucidation of the unprecedented thiotemplated butenolide biosynthesis by head&#8208;to&#8208;head fusion of two polyketide chains not only expands the synthetic biology toolbox but may also inspire the development of antivirulence strategies against BP pathogen infections.

A new molecule of propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMA) was developed as a novel electrolyte solvent for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) for the first time. The PMA is an environmentally friendly, cost&#8208;effective, and non&#8208;fluorinated organic solvent, particularly the unique ether&#8208;oxygen functionality that introduces high steric hindrance, resulting in weak lithium&#8208;ion coordination. This promotes the formation of contact ion pairs (CIPs) in the electrolyte solvation structure, particularly in the presence of dual salts, thereby significantly enhancing electrolyte compatibility with both the lithium metal anode and cathodes. The formulated PMA&#8208;based electrolyte enables the Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) battery to cycle stably at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5 V for over 100 cycles, retaining 90.1% of its initial capacity even at 60&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) operating at high cut&#8208;off voltages can achieve an energy density exceeding 500 Wh kg&#8722;1; however, they often suffer from severe capacity degradation due to electrolyte decomposition. Herein, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMA) is introduced as a novel solvent for LMB electrolytes. The unique ether&#8208;oxygen functionality in PMA exhibits high steric hindrance, leading to weak lithium&#8208;ion coordination, which promotes the formation of contact ion pairs (CIPs) in the electrolyte solvation structure, especially in the presence of dual salts. A Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) battery employing the formulated PMA&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates stable cycling at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5 V for over 100 cycles, retaining 90.1% of its initial capacity even at 60&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, a molecular interfacial model is proposed to elucidate the impact of the designed electrolyte on electrode interfacial behavior and battery performance, providing valuable insights for the development of high&#8208;performance LMB electrolytes.

         <title>Ferromagnetic Ordering Outperforms Coordination Effects in Governing Oxygen Reduction Catalysis on High&#8208;Index Nickel Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study explored the link between ferromagnetic ordering, coordination number, and ORR activity in nickel single&#8208;crystal foils. We found that Ni (210) facets outperform Ni (310) and Ni (520) due to higher saturation magnetization and optimized d&#8208;band positioning. DFT calculations confirmed that ferromagnetic ordering, not surface coordination, drives catalytic performance by enhancing spin polarization and lowering energy barriers. External magnetic fields further boosted the activity of Ni foils.








Abstract
The role of surface spin configuration in spin&#8208;dependent catalytic reactions remains contentious, particularly when compared to the established dominance of coordination environments. Here, we resolve this debate by systematically probing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanisms on high&#8208;index Ni single&#8208;crystal facets ([210], [310], [520]) through integrated density functional theory (DFT) and experimental studies. Contrary to conventional d&#8208;band center predictions, we demonstrate that ferromagnetic ordering fundamentally dictates catalytic activity by stabilizing triplet O2 adsorption and lowering spin&#8208;forbidden transition barriers. The Ni (210) facet exhibits superior ORR performance (half&#8208;wave potential: 0.842&#160;V vs. RHE), outperforming Ni (310) and Ni (520) due to its optimized d&#8208;band center and enhanced saturation magnetization. External magnetic fields amplify this effect, yielding a 28% current density enhancement for Ni (210)&#8212;nearly triple that of Ni (520). Spin&#8208;polarized DFT calculations reveal that ferromagnetic ordering reduces the potential&#8208;determining step energy barrier for *OH desorption by 7.0%, overriding coordination&#8208;number effects. These findings establish ferromagnetic alignment as a critical design criterion for spin&#8208;engineered electrocatalysts, offering a paradigm shift from coordination&#8208;centric optimization to spin&#8208;polarized interface engineering.

         <title>A Monolithium Monohydrogen Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monohydrogen metalloporphyrin was synthesized by reacting lithium vapor with a thin film of tetraphenylporphyrin under UHV conditions. The resulting LiHTPP complex is thermally stable and isolable by vacuum sublimation. Spectroscopic and theoretical analyses reveal insights into its nonplanar structure, energetics, and mechanism of formation and reactivity, shedding light on porphyrin metalation pathways and functional material design.








Abstract
Porphyrins and their metal complexes play essential roles in biological and industrial processes, functioning as key components in catalysis, photodynamic therapy, and organic (opto&#8208;)electronic materials. Despite their significance, the intermediate states involved in metal incorporation into porphyrins remain poorly understood and are rarely observed as stable compounds. Here, we report the solvent&#8208;free synthesis of the first neutral alkali metal monohydrogen porphyrin, which was selectively obtained by reaction of lithium vapor with thin films of tetraphenylporphyrin (H2TPP) under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions. The resulting monolithium monohydrogen tetraphenylporphyrin (LiHTPP) exhibits remarkable thermal stability and can be sublimated under UHV at 485&#160;K without disproportionation, enabling its isolation. LiHTPP reacts with additional lithium to form dilithium tetraphenylporphyrin (Li2TPP), as confirmed through product analysis and reaction monitoring via photoelectron spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Complementary theoretical simulations provide deeper insight into the chemical structure of this non&#8208;planar complex and the energetics of its formation. This study advances the understanding of monohydrogen metalloporphyrins and their role in metalation pathways, introducing a novel synthetic route for stable intermediates. The study also underscores the potential of monohydrogen metalloporphyrins for developing catalysts and electronic materials with tunable properties.

         <title>Branching&#8208;Induced Intermolecular Repulsion Effects Drive Stable and Sustainable Flow Batteries on Condensed Nitroxyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We firstly propose a side&#8208;chain engineering strategy featuring a branched dual&#8208;ammonium structure for nitroxyl radical&#8208;based aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). This design enhances the intermolecular electrostatic repulsion of nitroxyl radicals by increasing &#8764;40% of binding energy barrier, thereby suppressing side reactions associated with molecular aggregation. The AORFB achieves a high&#8208;capacity retention rate of 99.992%/cycle (&#8764;99.85%/day) even at high concentrations. 








Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) play a critical role in scalable energy storage applications where safety, cost, and lifetime matter most. However, harnessing the organics with redox chemistry is plagued by major molecular engineering principles in reversible processes and transformations. Herein, breaking from the conventional linear substituent structures, we report a chain&#8208;branched dual&#8208;ammonium nitroxyl radicals derivative as a stable and flowable catholyte for AORFBs. Paired with a viologen anolyte, the AORFBs with condensed electrolytes deliver a high&#8208;capacity retention rate of 99.992%/cycle (99.85%/day) and a peak power density of 140.3&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. In situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible characterization and theoretical simulation elucidate that the branched dual&#8208;ammonium structure accelerates &#8764;40% of the binding energy barrier, thereby enhancing intermolecular electrostatic repulsion. This effect effectively inhibits side reactions triggered by nucleophilic attacks, particularly in condensed nitroxyl radicals, maintaining the structural stability of both radical and oxoammonium states as well as their reversible transformations. Our redox organic formulation offers a direction towards stable and high&#8208;energy density AORFBs that seamlessly integrate eco&#8208;friendliness, durability, and sustainability.

         <title>Impeding Thermal Atomization Enables Synthesizing Fe2N Cluster Liganded Single Fe&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>

Fe2N cluster liganded single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst was made via impending the conventional thermal atomization process. The in situ generated Fe2N clusters can optimate the electronic structures of Fe&#8208;N4 sites, thereby rendering Fe2Nnc/Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst a record&#8208;high oxygen reduction activity of 0.957&#160;V versus RHE in alkali condition.








Abstract
Anchoring a ligand, such as a functional group or a cluster, on the active metal center is an effective strategy for regulating the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Herein, we present a nitridation&#8208;induced&#8208;clustering strategy to produce not only SAC Fe&#8208;N4 in N&#8208;doped carbon nanorods, but also Fe2N cluster as a ligand anchored on the active Fe site (Fe2Nnc/Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C). Unlike the conventional iron atomization process, the reactive nitridation process can generate thermodynamically stable Fe2N intermediates by nitriding the initially formed iron oxide, thereby impeding subsequent thermal atomization to fabricate Fe2Nnc/Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts. Compared to the conventional SAC Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C with Fe&#8208;N4 active sites, the Fe2Nnc/Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C nanorods are more active for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yielding a record high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.957&#160;V versus RHE in alkaline condition. The Fe2Nnc/Fe1&#8208;N&#8208;C nanorods can be utilized as air&#8208;cathode catalysts for Zn&#8208;air batteries with a charge&#8208;discharge gap of only &#8764;0.658&#160;V and outstanding cyclability up to 1000 h. Theoretical calculations show that the Fe2Nnc ligands indeed modified the electronic structures of Fe&#8208;N4 sites, leading to a lower adsorption energy for the ORR intermediate OH* and facilitating the desorption of OH* and thus higher activity for ORR.

         <title>Complementary Hydrogen&#9472;Bonded Functionalized Mixed Conducting Terpolymers for High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;type Organic Electrochemical Transistors and Healable Inverters</title>

The strategic incorporation of dynamic hydrogen bonds into the conjugated backbone of the terpolymer enhances mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting performance, originating from the unique microstructure that synergistically enhances electron mobility and volume capacitance, thereby achieving high&#8208;performing n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors and self&#8208;healing, high&#8208;gain inverters. These novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymeric mixed conductors pave the way for the advancement of next&#8208;generation flexible bioelectronic devices.








Abstract
High&#8208;performing n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), crucial for integrated circuits in wearable bioelectronics, demand organic mixed ion&#8208;electron conductors (OMIECs) that exhibit efficient mixed conduction and biological functionality for practical applications. However, the development of self&#8208;healing OMIECs has not yet been achieved due to the lack of suitable synthetic strategies. Here, we present a design concept through incorporating dynamic cross&#8208;linked hydrogen&#8208;bonded in the polymer backbone for the first demonstration of self&#8208;healing polymeric mixed conductors, enabling high&#8208;performing OECTs and high gain, self&#8208;healing inverters. These devices exhibit a mixed conducting figure of merit &#181;C* of 118 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, three times higher than the copolymer without hydrogen bond, along with simultaneously improved volumetric capacitance and electron mobility. These improvements are attributed to the unique microstructure created by hydrogen bond, which results in a closer &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance within smaller crystalline domain sizes. Additionally, a cost&#8208;effective post&#8208;processing side chain removal method is proposed, which retains high performance in n&#8208;type OECTs. Remarkably, inverters based on the hydrogen&#8208;bonded terpolymer demonstrate high gain and self&#8208;healing capabilities through solvent vapor exposure and annealing treatment. Insights from these terpolymers emphasize the use of dynamic hydrogen bonds in the conjugated backbone to enhance performance and enable self&#8208;healing high&#8208;gain inverters, advancing wearable bioelectronics for practical applications.

         <title>Blue&#8208;to&#8208;Green Fine&#8208;Tunable Narrowband Delayed Fluorescence in Peripherally Dendritic Modified Bis&#8208;Indolocarbazoles</title>

         <dc:description>
An exquisite color tuning of narrowband thermally activated delayed fluorescence from deep&#8208;blue to green was achieved for non&#8208;boron ubiquitous luminophores based on the dendritic modification design concept. The corresponding OLEDs exhibited high&#8208;efficiency, high&#8208;color&#8208;purity blue and green electroluminescence, with high external quantum efficiencies of up to 24.0% and 28.5%, respectively, and CIE coordinates of (0.13, 0.10) and (0.21, 0.68).








Abstract
Highly efficient narrowband organic luminophores offer immense potentials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity of electroluminescence (EL). Appropriately controlling their structural relaxation and vibronic couplings between the excited and ground states enables the desired narrowband emissions. Herein, based on a design concept featuring dendritic modifications, we demonstrate the exquisite color tuning of narrowband emissions from deep blue to green in non&#8208;boron ubiquitous molecular systems. By attaching two or four arylamine&#8208;based dendritic units to the periphery of the indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]indolo[1&#8242;,2&#8242;,3&#8242;:1,7]indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole (BICz) core, BICz&#8208;1.5G, BICz&#8208;2G, and BICz&#8208;2GII were developed as deep&#8208;blue, sky&#8208;blue, and green narrowband emitters, respectively. Comprehensive photophysical and computational studies revealed that the dendritic modifications do not impair the inherent narrowband emission ability of BICz while enhancing its thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties. OLEDs incorporating BICz&#8208;1.5G and BICz&#8208;2GII demonstrated high&#8208;efficiency, high&#8208;color&#8208;purity blue and green EL, with maximum external quantum efficiencies as high as 24.0% and 28.5%, respectively, and CIE coordinates of (0.13, 0.10) and (0.21, 0.68). Our findings will contribute to expanding the search space for narrowband organic luminophores.

         <title>Interfacing B&#8208;DNA and DNA Mimic Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical aromatic oligoamide DNA mimic foldamers that reproduce the shape and charge distribution of duplex B&#8208;DNA have been interfaced with DNA duplexes by means of a new linker that serves both as a DNA hairpin and as an aromatic oligoamide unit. In the resulting chimeric molecules, the linker does not perturb the DNA duplex structure and converts the chirality of DNA into handedness control of the foldamer helix.








Abstract
A linker unit was designed and synthesized that can serve both as a hairpin turn in a DNA duplex and anchor point for an aromatic helical foldamer mimicking the shape and surface properties of B&#8208;DNA. Methods were developed to synthesize natural/non&#8208;natural chimeric molecules combining foldamer and DNA segments. The ability of the linker to position the foldamer helix and the duplex DNA so that their rims and grooves are in register, despite their completely different chemical nature, was demonstrated using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, circular dichroism and molecular models. Bio&#8208;layer interferometry confirmed that artificial hairpin DNA duplexes keep their ability to bind to DNA binding proteins. The chimeric molecules may pave the way to competitive inhibitors of protein&#8208;DNA interactions involving sequence&#8208;selective DNA&#8208;binding proteins.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive DNA Droplets for Controlling Enzyme Cascade Pathways by Dynamic Phase Separation</title>

Y&#8208;motif sequences with azobenzene&#8208;modified sticky ends (SE) were designed to form Azo&#8208;DNA droplets via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. These droplets enable selective sequestration of enzymes within compartments, allowing dynamic regulation of enzymatic cascades in response to ultraviolet (UV) and visible (Vis) light stimuli. 








Abstract
Precise control of enzymatic cascade pathways is essential for deepening our understanding of metabolic processes and designing synthetic biochemical systems. In this study, we present a novel approach to modulate these cascades using light&#8208;responsive DNA droplets. Y&#8208;motif sequences with azobenzene&#8208;modified sticky ends (SE) were designed to form DNA droplets via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation. These droplets enable selective sequestration of enzymes within compartments, allowing dynamic regulation of enzymatic cascades in response to ultraviolet (UV) and visible (vis) light stimuli. As a model system, we employed an incompatible enzymatic cascade, involving glucose oxidase (GOx), horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and catalase (CAT). Under visible light, the DNA droplets co&#8208;localize enzymes within the compartments, effectively regulating metabolic flux without altering the total enzyme concentration. Upon UV exposure, the droplets disassemble, releasing the sequestered enzymes and altering cascade dynamics. The versatility of this approach was further demonstrated using an alternative enzymatic cascade system comprising galactose oxidase (GAO), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and CAT. This system demonstrates that light&#8208;responsive DNA droplets are a powerful tool for regulating enzymatic pathways, with potential applications in synthetic biology, microreactor design, and bioengineering.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Indium Sulfide Catalyst for Efficient and Robust Electrocatalytic CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing strategy has been developed to prepare the reduction&#8211;corrosion resistant indium sulfide in the tetragonal phase for the efficient and stable electroconversion of CO2 to formate. 








Abstract
The reduction&#8211;reconstruction of the catalyst under negative bias has been identified as a significant rationale underlying the performance degradation of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Screening catalysts with stable phases and robust crystal structures appears to be a feasible approach to counteract the reduction corrosion. In this work, with the guidance of computational predictions, a tetragonal phase In2S3 electrocatalyst is designed through a self&#8208;healing strategy for the conversion of CO2 to formate. Remarkably, In2S3 exhibits superior stability for over 200&#160;h at a current density of &#8764;210&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a persistent formate faradaic efficiency of &#8764;97%. A series of in situ spectroscopic measurements confirm that In2S3 maintains the structural and valence state integrity throughout the reaction. Combined with density functional theory calculations, the performance enhancement mechanism and self&#8208;healing principle of In2S3 are clearly elucidated. This work provides a novel perspective for the design of highly efficient and stable CO2RR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Unlocking a Ferrocenium Superoxidizer with the Perfluorinated Cp* Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and full characterization of the electron deficient ferrocene [Fe(C5H5)(C5(CF3)5)] and its ferrocenium salt is reported. An extreme redox potential of E1/2&#160;=&#160;1.35&#160;V (versus Fc/Fc+) enables its synthetic use as a powerful oxidizing agent.








Abstract
The photolytically induced arene displacement of [Fe(C5H5)(oDCB)][PF6] (oDCB = ortho&#8208;dichlorobenzene) in the presence of [NEt4][C5(CF3)5] afforded the highly fluorinated and benchstable ferrocene [Fe(C5H5)(C5(CF3)5)]. The perfluorinated Cp* ligand exerts an extreme electron withdrawing effect on the ferrocene with E1/2&#160;=&#160;1.35&#160;V (versus Fc/Fc+). This proved to be the highest value obtained for any ferrocene reported so far. The corresponding stable and storable ferrocenium complex [Fe(C5H5)(C5(CF3)5)][AsF6] was generated in quantitative yield and represents not only the most oxidizing ferrocenium species, but also the strongest known isolable organometallic oxidizer. Its strength was demonstrated by the twofold oxidation of [Fe(C5(CH3)5)2] to its dication and an oxidative C&#8208;H activation of ortho&#8208;terphenyl. This unprecedented redox chemistry combined with perfluorocarbon solubility allows for selective and quantitative recycling of the highly fluorinated ferrocene. Together with the low basicity and inertness of [Fe(C5H5)(C5(CF3)5)], the chemistry of strong oxidizers is herein expanded into organometallics.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Augmented Molecular Dynamics Simulations (MD) Reveal Insights Into the Disconnect Between Affinity and Activation of ZTP Riboswitch Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study combines computational and experimental approaches to study how natural and synthetic small molecules interact with the ZTP riboswitch, a bacterial RNA element that regulates gene expression. Using chemical synthesis, biochemical approaches, and artificial intelligence augmented MD simulations, we analyze both ligand binding and riboswitch activation. Findings show that ligand on&#8208;rates, but not affinity, drive activation and offer insights into RNA structural dynamics.








Abstract
The challenge of targeting RNA with small molecules necessitates a better understanding of RNA&#8211;ligand interaction mechanisms. However, the dynamic nature of nucleic acids, their ligand&#8208;induced stabilization, and how conformational changes influence gene expression pose significant difficulties for experimental investigation. This work employs a combination of computational and experimental methods to address these challenges. By integrating structure&#8208;informed design, crystallography, and machine learning&#8208;augmented all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations (MD), we synthesized, biophysically and biochemically characterized, and studied the dissociation of a library of small molecule activators of the 5&#8208;aminoimidazole&#8211;4&#8211;carboxamide ribonucleotide triphosphate (ZTP) riboswitch, a ligand&#8208;binding RNA motif that regulates bacterial gene expression. We uncovered key interaction mechanisms, revealing valuable insights into the role of ligand binding kinetics on riboswitch activation. Further, we established that ligand on&#8208;rates determine activation potency as opposed to binding affinity and elucidated RNA structural differences, which provide mechanistic insights into the interplay of RNA structure on riboswitch&#160;activation.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks Coupled with Redox Center and Adsorption Site for Efficient Shuttle&#8208;Free Zn&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of covalent organic frameworks incorporating both sulfur adsorption sites and ruthenium redox centers were successfully constructed as cathode materials for Zn&#8208;I2 batteries. The synergistic effect between the sulfur sites and ruthenium centers accelerates the adsorption and redox conversion of polyiodide species, thereby effectively mitigating the shuttle effect.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries exhibit significant potential for next&#8208;generation energy storage system, but the polyiodide shuttle effect severely impairs their performance and stability. Herein, a series of woven covalent organic frameworks (COFs), namely COF&#8208;RuNCS&#8208;X (X&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;6), with pre&#8208;designed ruthenium(II) redox center and sulfur adsorption sites were constructed for shuttle&#8208;free cathode material in Zn&#8208;I2 batteries. The porous COF&#8208;RuNCS&#8208;X with abundant sulfur adsorption sites showed a selective adsorption of I3&#8722; species for effectively mitigating the shuttle effect. Meanwhile, the incorporation of ruthenium(II) center into the COFs skeleton enhanced the redox kinetics of iodine species. Remarkably, COF&#8208;RuNCS&#8208;6 featuring the large pore size and high degree of conjugation demonstrated a discharge specific capacity as high as 395.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 in Zn&#8208;I2 batteries and exhibited cycle stability up to 5000 cycles. This work provides a new understanding of the design of COF&#8208;based materials as efficient shuttle&#8208;free cathode materials for Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.

&lt;p&gt;A series of covalent organic frameworks incorporating both sulfur adsorption sites and ruthenium redox centers were successfully constructed as cathode materials for Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. The synergistic effect between the sulfur sites and ruthenium centers accelerates the adsorption and redox conversion of polyiodide species, thereby effectively mitigating the shuttle effect.

         <title>Dual Enzyme&#8208;Responsive Polymer&#8208;Drug Conjugates Induce Diverse Cells Mutual Transcytosis to Achieve Deep Pancreatic Tumor Penetration</title>

Fibroblast&#8208;activated protease (FAP) and &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) dual&#8208;responsive polymer&#8208;SN38 conjugates achieve deep penetration into pancreatic tumors by inducing mutual transcytosis of cancer cells and cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The dual enzyme&#8208;responsive polymer&#8208;SN38 conjugates inhibit cancer progression in patient&#8208;derived xenografts (PDXs) and orthotopic xenografts of pancreatic tumors, exerting greater antitumor activity than the first&#8208;line drug gemcitabine.








Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;responsive active transporting nanomedicines have shown promise in overcoming the tumor&#8208;dense extracellular matrix barrier by inducing cancer cells&#8217; intercellular transcytosis to deliver drugs deep into solid tumors. However, nanomedicine only responsive to the cancer cell&#8208;related enzyme is not very effective in pancreatic tumors because successive transcytosis cannot be established among the cancer cells, which are scattered in a large number of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Here are reported dual&#8208;enzyme&#8208;responsive 7&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (SN38)&#8208;polymer conjugates capable of inducing transcytosis among cancer cells and CAFs to infiltrate pancreatic tumors efficiently. The conjugates are zwitterionic for long blood circulation. Once in the tumor, the &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) overexpressed on the tumor endothelial and cancer cells, or the fibroblast&#8208;activated protease (FAP) on CAFs, can cleave the &#947;&#8208;glutamylamide or the prolylglycine dipeptide amides, producing primary amines. The cationized conjugate then induces transcytosis among cancer cells and CAFs, establishing successive intercellular transport to infiltrate the tumor. The conjugates' enzyme reactivity and overall hydrophobicity determine their cationization and transcytosis behaviors. The conjugates with high hydrophobicity and fast cationization show potent antitumor activity in pancreatic cancer patient&#8208;derived xenograft and orthotopic tumor models. This study provides an active transportation strategy to overcome the delivery barrier of tumors with rich stroma cells.

         <title>Operando Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Visualizing Electrochemical Triple&#8208;Phase Boundary</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando magnetic resonance imaging has been developed to enable direct visualization of electrochemical triple&#8208;phase boundaries (TPBs). Applied to proton exchange membrane fuel cells, this technique provides in situ monitoring of cathode water accumulation and TPB evolution, facilitating the assessment of flooding effects while simultaneously mapping active reaction zones.








Abstract
The triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB) is a complex interface where gas, liquid, and solid phases converge, crucially regulating the efficiency and performance of many electrochemical devices including fuel cells and batteries. However, conventional characterization techniques struggle to capture the dynamic processes and flooding at TPB. To address this, we develop operando electrochemical magnetic resonance imaging (EC&#8208;MRI), an inherently non&#8208;invasive technique sensitive to 1H, which probes both bulk and boundary regions, enabling real&#8208;time visualization of TPB evolution and a deeper understanding of its function at the device level under operational conditions. In a study of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), with a focus on the kinetically sluggish O2 reduction reaction in the cathode, operando EC&#8208;MRI quantitatively illustrates the interplay between power output, water content, and TPB evolution. It reveals that the TPB maps undergo significant spatial and dynamic variations, with TPB deterioration, rather than apparent water accumulation, directly triggering flooding, as proved using catalysts with different water generation and adsorption capabilities. Our finding opens new perspectives on water management and TPB design, with potential applications in other critical electrochemical processes such as H2 oxidation, CO2 reduction, and N2 reduction, underscoring the value of operando EC&#8208;MRI for real&#8208;time diagnostics of electrochemical devices.

         <title>Oxidative Electrocyclization Assembles 2,2&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran in Fungal Indole Alkaloids</title>

A berberine bridge&#8208;like oxidoreductase mediates oxidative electrocyclization to form the 2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran (DMP) ring in fungal indole alkaloids. Heterologous gene expression, in vitro enzyme activity reconstitution, and mechanistic studies unveil nature's strategy for pyran formation via enzymatic electrocyclization, expanding biocatalytic pericyclic chemistry.








Abstract
Pericyclic reactions, such as cycloaddition and electrocyclization, are among the most useful approaches for constructing complex natural products with diverse biological activities. While enzymatic pericyclic reactions have been increasingly reported in recent years, there are only a few examples of enzyme&#8208;mediated electrocyclization reactions. The 2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran (DMP) ring plays a significant role in constituting many bioactive fungal and plant natural products. In this study, we characterize the vsc biosynthetic gene cluster of the DMP&#8208;containing natural product versicamide A (1) in Aspergillus versicolor DL0022. The biosynthetic route for DMP formation and the biochemical functions of the involved enzymes are fully elucidated. Specifically, we reveal that the berberine bridge&#8208;like oxidoreductase VscB mediates a crucial oxidative process, followed by an electrocyclization to form a C&#9472;O bridge bond, thereby affording the key DMP ring. Structural simulation, molecular modeling, mutational analysis, and quantum chemical calculations elucidate the oxidative electrocyclization mechanism. The flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor of VscB/NotD' facilitates hydride abstraction at the C25 position of the substrate, while the key amino acid residue E529 acts as a general base to deprotonate the C6 hydroxyl group.

         <title>Selective Aerobic Oxidation of Toluene to Benzaldehyde by Parallel Photoinduced Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer and Energy Transfer Through Multiphoton Excitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In response to the challenges of peroxidation and undesirable side reactions associated with the selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde in industrial processes, we synthesized a three&#8208;dimensional porous Zn&#8208;AQ framework using Zn and Na as nodes and anthraquinone as the ligand through a coordination self&#8208;assembly strategy. The high selectivity of lattice oxygen combined with the high efficiency of parallel multiphoton produces an excellent synergistic effect, which enables the oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde with the high selectivity of 93.7% and the TOF of 2.57&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Selectively aerobic oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde is an important but challenging task due to the high proclivity of aldehydes to undergo over&#8208;oxidation to acids. Herein, we report a new multiphoton excitation approach for synthesizing benzaldehyde from toluene by integrating oxygen vacancy and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) events into one coordination polymer (Zn&#8208;AQ) to enhance efficiency and selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;In response to the challenges of peroxidation and undesirable side reactions associated with the selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde in industrial processes, we synthesized a three-dimensional porous Zn-AQ framework using Zn and Na as nodes and anthraquinone as the ligand through a coordination self-assembly strategy. The high selectivity of lattice oxygen combined with the high efficiency of parallel multiphoton produces an excellent synergistic effect, which enables the oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde with the high selectivity of 93.7% and the TOF of 2.57&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selectively aerobic oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde is an important but challenging task due to the high proclivity of aldehydes to undergo over-oxidation to acids. Herein, we report a new multiphoton excitation approach for synthesizing benzaldehyde from toluene by integrating oxygen vacancy and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) events into one coordination polymer (Zn-AQ) to enhance efficiency and selectivity. Under light irradiation, the ligand facilitates photoinduced PCET and photoinduced energy transfer (EnT), generating radical species from the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H bonds and highly active &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; species. The &#960;-stacking interactions between the ligands enforced the metal centers to form Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Na&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Na polyoxometalate chains with oxygen vacancy sites for the selective oxidation of the radical intermediate. Zn-AQ endows the efficient and selective oxidation of aromatic benzyl C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H bonds into aldehydes, including the conversion of toluene into benzaldehyde with the selectivity up to 94%, by combining the energies of three photons in one catalytic cycle.

         <title>Reactivity of Pnictaalumenes Towards 1,3&#8208;Dipole Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pnictaalumenes with a Pn&#9552;Al multiple bonds undergo azide or diazoalkene insertions rather than [3+2] cycloadditions. This results in AlN2P heterocycles, which show a great structural variety depending on the sterics of the azide. With TMS&#8208;diazoalkane, thermal rearrangements afford rare cyanidoaluminates.








Abstract
Alkynes undergo 1,3&#8208;dipolar cyclization reactions with organic azides giving 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. Pnictaalumenes RPn&#9552;AlR&#712; are the isoelectronic congeners of alkynes, hence a similar reactivity toward 1,3&#8208;dipole molecules is expected. Herein, we report the reactions of DippTerPn&#9552;AlCp* (DippTer&#160; = &#160;2,6&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)&#8208;C6H3, Cp*&#160; = &#160;[Me5C5], Pn&#160; = &#160;P, As) toward aryl azides. Instead of the anticipated phosphaaluminatriazole products from a [3+2] cyclization, the formation of four&#8208;membered AlN2Pn ring systems of the general form DippTerPn(&#956;&#8208;NR)2AlCp* was observed. Depending on the steric profile of the azide, different outcomes were observed: a) N&#945; insertion into the Pn&#9552;Al bond accompanied by twofold N2 elimination, b) N&#947; insertion under preservation of the N3 motif, or c) mixed Na/N&#947; products. The bonding situation is complex and best described as Al(III) complexes with NPnN&#8208;amino&#8208;amide&#8208;type ligands. A twofold insertion also occurs with the isovalent electronic diazoalkane Me3Si(H)C&#9552;N2, yielding imine&#8208;substituted AlN2Pn derivatives. In the case of its P&#8208;congener, two thermal rearrangements were observed, which first result in a AlN3P ring species with a terminal Al&#9472;CN unit, followed by a second slower rearrangement to an aluminate cyanido complex with an unusual NNN pincer&#8208;type ligand framework. The current study contrasts well&#8208;established [3+2] cyclization reactions between alkynes and 1,3&#8208;dipoles and provides access to unprecedented ligand motifs.

         <title>Regulating Solvating Sites for Stable High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;anchoring strategy is proposed to regulate the solvating sites of diglyme (G2) molecular via specific anchoring agents 1,1,1,3,3&#8208;pentafluorobutane (PFB) and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE). This strategy results in an electrolyte with exceptional compatibility with both lithium metal anode and high&#8208;voltage cathode, enabling stable lithium metal battery.








Abstract
The long&#8208;lasting stability of high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) critically rely on both the cathodic and anodic stability of electrolytes, which can be enhanced by increasing the salt&#8208;to&#8208;solvent molar ratio. However, this approach is limited by solubility constraints. In this work, we introduce a dual&#8208;anchoring strategy to regulate the solvating sites of glymes via directional atomic interactions. Specifically, F&#948;&#8722;&#8211;H&#948;+ interactions transform the Li+&#8208;glyme coordination and induce more anion coordination within Li+ primary solvation sheath, whereas H&#948;+&#8211;O&#948;&#8722; interactions reduce the electron density at free oxygen sites, thus raising the oxidational potential of glyme and enhancing the overall oxidation stability of electrolytes. This strategy results in an electrolyte with exceptional compatibility with both lithium metal anode (LMA) and high&#8208;voltage cathode, enabling LMA with an ultrahigh coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.76%. Furthermore, the assembled LMBs exhibit extended lifespans, retaining 80% of their capacity under aggressive conditions: 834 and 370 cycles at 4.4 and 4.5&#160;V, respectively, for 30&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;Li||2.0&#8208;mAh cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells and 100 cycles for anode&#8208;free Cu||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch cells. This work offers novel insights into the advancement of next&#8208;generation LMBs based on ether&#8208;based electrolytes.

         <title>Atomic Heterointerface Engineering and Nonequilibrium Carrier Dynamics for Enhanced Photocatalysis in Halide Perovskite/MoS2 Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface engineering of FAPbBr3 enables atomically&#8208;bridged ultrafast charge transport channels at FAPbBr3/MoS2 heterointerfaces, significantly enhancing charge separation efficiency from 29% to 63% and achieving a 100&#8208;fold improvement in photocatalytic activity. Unlike conventional Type&#8208;II and S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, the interfacial charge transfer is driven by a nonequilibrium charge transfer generated through charge density gradients.








Abstract
Halide perovskites hold promise for solar&#8208;driven photocatalysis in fuel production owing to their superior light absorption and carrier diffusion. However, precise control and understanding of interfacial charge separation dynamics in their heterostructures remain challenging. Using formamidinium lead bromide/molybdenum disulfide (FAPbBr3/MoS2) as a model, we engineered Pb&#8208;rich, Pb&#8208;neutral, and Pb&#8208;deficient surfaces via precursor stoichiometry tuning, modulating interface coupling through Pb&#9472;S bonds. High&#8208;density atomic bridging in Pb&#8208;rich interfaces boosts photogenerated charge separation efficiency from 29% to 63%, yielding a 98&#8208;fold hydrogen production increase and record 8.69% solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the long carrier diffusion length and high photogenerated charge density of perovskites create a steep charge density gradient at the interface. This gradient directly induces a nonequilibrium internal electric field, which governs the charge transport dynamics. This work demonstrates the feasibility of sophisticated heterointerface tailoring and advances the understanding of the driving forces behind interfacial charge separation for perovskite photocatalysts.

         <title>Negatively Curved Diaza&#8208;Octagon Heterocycle Fused with Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Deep&#8208;Blue Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effects of electronic and geometric engineering have been utilized to synthesize a diaza&#8208;octagon fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) skeleton (8NN) with ultra&#8208;narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission. Its phenyl and boron derivatives 8NNP and 8NNB showed excellent performances in OLEDs.








Abstract
Developing new polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) skeletons with narrowband emission is crucial for advancing ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. Inspired by the aesthetic configuration of negatively curved octagonal rings and the multiple resonance (MR) effect, we designed a novel diaza&#8208;octagon heterocycle fused with PAHs, abbreviated as 8NN, and its phenyl&#8208;substituted derivative 8NNP. Crystal data and theoretical calculations show that their peripheral PAHs exhibit significant rigidity, while the internal diaza&#8208;octagon ring confers skeleton flexibility and flipping properties. Notably, owing to the strategic embedding and unique bonding form of nitrogen atoms, their MR effect is significantly enhanced. Finally, 8NN and 8NNP achieve deep&#8208;blue emission peaking at 408 and 411&#160;nm, with remarkably narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 19 and 17&#160;nm, respectively, and aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission characteristics. Additionally, to further tune emission range of this new skeleton, boron&#8208;functionalized 8NNB was synthesized, achieving blue emission peaking at 461&#160;nm in toluene, with a FWHM of 31&#160;nm. Finally, the OLEDs based on 8NNP and 8NNB exhibit maximum external quantum efficiencies of 3.47% and 24.24%, with CIE coordinates of (0.172, 0.043) and (0.132, 0.256), respectively. These results validate the rational design of the novel skeleton and facilitate the development of narrowband emission materials.

         <title>Microhydration Dynamics in Molecular Photoswitches: Equilibrium State Reconfiguration in Imine&#8208;Based Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of molecular photoswitches relies on their structural adaptability in solution. Employing gas&#8208;phase rotational spectroscopy and quantum chemistry, we explore the microhydration of camphorquinone imine and show that water binding shifts the E/Z equilibrium, even reversing relative stabilities, while enabling dynamic motion at low temperatures. These insights reveal the interplay of structure, solvation, and switching energetics.








Abstract
The functional performance of a molecular photoswitch relies strongly on its ability to undergo structural changes in solution. In this context, microsolvation studies in the gas phase provide access to the conformational panorama of these systems in a size&#8208;controlled hydrated environment. Here, we exploit this gas&#8208;phase vantage point alongside quantum&#8208;chemistry calculations to study the structural properties and microhydration dynamics of camphorquinone imine, a chiral molecule holding the functionality to engage in a motor&#8208;like function upon light activation. Using molecular rotational resonance spectroscopy with supersonic jets, we detect and analyze the first&#8208; and second&#8208;order water complexes of the chiral imine. Our findings reveal that initial hydration steps significantly impact the equilibrium between open (E) and closed (Z) forms, culminating in a reversal of relative stability for the switch states. Despite being captured at rotational temperatures near 1 K, we find that water molecules exhibit notable mobility due to the lack of prominent stabilizing secondary interactions. Additionally, the assignment of a key higher&#8208;energy closed (Z) water complex provides insights into the energy required for switching between (E) and (Z) states during collisional cooling. We discuss these effects and rationalize them in terms of molecular forces and internal dynamics governing early solvation.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Transformation in a Thermally Stable All&#8208;Inorganic Polyoxoniobate Framework Boosts Lithium Ion Battery Anode Performance</title>

A single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation in the first antimony&#8208;bridged all&#8208;inorganic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polyoxoniobate framework exposes additional Li&#8208;binding sites and reduces the interlayer Li&#8208;ion diffusion barrier, resulting in a significant increase in capacity of Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Niobium oxides are considered as promising anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their excellent rate&#8208;performance. However, the practical application is hindered by their limited specific capacity. In this work, we report the first example of an all&#8208;inorganic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) niobate framework as anode material for LIBs. The title compound is based on antimony&#8208;linked bivanadyl&#8208;capped &#945;&#8208;Keggin polyoxoniobates as secondary building units. The compound undergoes a unique single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation triggered by formic acid which results in the migration of a {VO} unit into the framework interlayer. This results in a 34% increase of the specific capacity, reaching 519&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A g&#8722;1, thereby surpassing most Nb&#8208;based LIB anode materials. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the SCSC transformation exposes more Li&#8208;binding sites in the framework, and reduces the interlayer Li&#8208;ion diffusion barrier, leading to a capacity increase. This work presents the first example of a SCSC transformation leading to enhanced LIB performance and offers atomic&#8208;level insights into the design of advanced LIB anode materials.

         <title>Lattice Compression&#8208;Driven Electron Localization and Ir&#8208;O Coupling Synergistically Enable Ultralow Overpotential Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high chemical stability of Li2CO3 severely impedes its decomposition, limiting the efficiency of the CO2 evolution reaction. Herein, a lattice compression strategy is employed to enhance electronic localization, accelerating CO2 reduction, and strengthening Ir&#8211;O coupling, which induces low&#8208;crystallinity Li2CO3 formation. This approach significantly reduces overpotential and extends battery cycle life.








Abstract
Developing efficient cathode catalysts plays a crucial role in improving the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and CO2 evolution reaction (CO2ER) kinetics in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. However, the chemical stability of the wide&#8208;bandgap insulator Li2CO3 severely hinders the CO2ER. To address this challenge, this study proposes a lattice compression strategy in which electronic localization accelerates the CO2RR, thereby enhancing Ir&#8211;O coupling and inducing the formation of low&#8208;crystallinity Li2CO3, ultimately optimizing the CO2ER process. This approach enables the Li&#8211;CO2 battery to achieve an ultralow overpotential of 0.33&#160;V and an exceptionally high energy efficiency of &#8764;88.7%. Moreover, even after over 1100 h of operation, the battery maintains a stable charging potential of 3.3&#160;V, representing the best performance reported to date. Through in situ and ex situ characterizations combined with theoretical calculations, we reveal that lattice compression leads to changes in the coordination environment, thereby enhancing electronic localization effects. This accelerates Li+ migration near the catalyst surface, facilitating its rapid participation in CO2RR. Subsequently, the strengthened Ir&#8211;O coupling modulates the symmetry of Li2CO3 molecules, reduces their crystallinity, and ultimately promotes their efficient decomposition. This study provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance bidirectional cathode catalysts through crystal facet engineering.

Abstract
Here, a primary alkylative difunctionalization of olefins based on the decarboxylation of carboxylate ions to obtain alkyl radicals by electrochemical anodic oxidation is reported. The reaction employs quaternary ammonium carboxylates as the source of alkyl radicals and does not require additional oxidizing agents or electrolytes. The reaction exhibits a broad substrate range and functional group compatibility. It gently converts mono&#8208; or disubstituted styrene substrates and alkyl carboxylate anions of various carbon chain lengths and substituents to products under the reaction conditions. Furthermore, it is important to note that not only alcohols but carboxylic acids and water can also serve as nucleophilic reagents to participate in the reaction and yield the corresponding products. Preliminary mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the reaction is enabled by the lower oxidation potential of the carboxylate anion compared to that of the olefin. The anodic oxidation of the carboxylate anion occurs prior to the oxidation of the olefin, followed by decarboxylation to obtain alkyl radicals.

         <title>The Role of Reducibility of PtGaOx&#8208;Based Catalysts for Efficient and Durable Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction&#8208;induced reduction of oxidized GaOx was found to be the main cause of deactivation for PtGaOx catalysts in PDH because of the lower reactivity of reduced GaOx to form hydrogen through Pt&#8208;assisted recombination of two surface H atoms formed from propane. This undesired transformation can be inhibited by increasing the strength of the Ga&#9472;O&#9472;Al bond. To control this property, GaAlOx solid solutions were used as supports for Pt and to avoid the presence of supported GaOx species.








Abstract
Although PtGaOx&#8208;containing catalysts are active and selective in the non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene, they suffer from rapid deactivation and, especially, inability to recover their initial performance in a series of PDH/oxidative regeneration cycles, characteristics that are highly relevant to commercialization. Herein, we identified reducibility of GaOx as the key descriptor affecting the above catalyst features. Oxidized GaOx species are more active than reduced GaOx in the recombination of two H species formed from propane, which is the rate&#8208;limiting step in the PDH reaction. This process is further accelerated by Pt. The reduction of GaOx with time on propane stream leads to catalyst deactivation. Easily reducible GaOx also tend to form PtGaOx under PDH conditions, from which Pt atoms present in fresh catalysts cannot be completely recovered during oxidative regeneration, which is detrimental to catalyst durability. Regardless of the reaction atmosphere, Pt single atoms exist on the surface of PtGaOx&#8208;containing catalysts with hardly reducible GaOx. Based on the knowledge derived, we developed a catalyst with 500&#160;ppm Pt on the surface of mixed GaAlOx, which outperforms almost all previous PtGaOx&#8208;containing catalysts in terms of space&#8208;time yield of propylene formation and shows durable operation under industrially relevant conditions.

The &#8220;pseudo&#8208;charge&#8208;transfer complex&#8221; electrolyte employs the amide polymer encapsulation matrix (APEM) to construct localized charge&#8208;transfer channels toward solvents, tuning the negative charge center. The APEM promotes cation&#8208;anion coordination in the primary solvation sheath, establishing the AGGs&#8208;dominated interface, thereby achieving excellent wide&#8208;temperature performance (&#8722;40&#8764;80&#160;&#176;C) and high energy density (490&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1).








Abstract
Electric vehicles and electric aircraft demand all&#8208;climate lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy density. However, the interaction mechanism between charge transfer in the solvation sheath and interfacial evolution is not yet clear. Herein, we proposed a &#8220;pseudo&#8208;charge&#8208;transfer complex&#8221; strategy by introducing an amide polymer encapsulation matrix (APEM) to construct local charge&#8208;transfer channels to solvents for tuning the negative charge center. Theoretical calculations and synchrotron X&#8208;ray tomography reveal that the APEM drags out the polar solvent and promotes cation&#8208;anion coordination in the primary solvation sheath, contributing to AGGs&#8208;dominated interfacial solvation chemistry. The designed electrolyte improves the cyclability of Li|LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 up to 300 cycles at 4.6&#160;V and high&#8208;temperature capability at 80&#160;&#176;C. Even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, it still delivers a high capacity of 87.9&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with negligible capacity decay for 160 cycles. Industrial 3&#160;Ah&#8208;level pouch cells over 490&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 exhibit 91.3% capacity retention after 100 cycles, manifesting high potential in extreme applications.

         <title>Redirecting the Peptide Cleavage Causes Protease Inactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cysteine proteases catalyze substrate cleavage by a two&#8208;step acyl transfer mechanism. Newly designed peptidic inhibitors of human cathepsin B with N&#8208;terminal carbamate warheads undergo a redirected cleavage and generate non&#8208;canonical covalent complexes. Representatives of this chemotype exhibit second order rate constants of inactivation greater than 10&#160;000&#160;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1.








Abstract
Cysteine and serine proteases cleave peptides through covalent catalysis by generating a transient adduct with the N&#8208;terminal part of the substrate after releasing its C&#8208;terminal part. We demonstrate the unique redirection of this event leading to strong enzyme inactivation. For targeting human cathepsin B, a cysteine protease of significant therapeutic importance, we designed tailored peptidomimetics with a variety of dipeptide fragments directed toward the occluding loop and equipped with numerous N&#8208;terminal carbamate warheads. The carbamate deprotonation catalyzed by the active site thiolate initiates the redirected cleavage. The C&#8208;terminal part of the inhibitors remains covalently attached to the protease. Hydrolysis of such carbamoyl&#8208;enzyme complexes is catalytically unsupported rendering inhibition irreversible. This novel mechanism of action comprises a significant extension of the covalent drug space.

         <title>Small Fluorinated Aromatic Molecule&#8208;Based Radiofrequency Identification Tags Enabled by Stepwise Tuning of Nuclear Shielding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward design strategy for rationally manipulating the 19F chemical shifts of fluorinated aromatics (FArs) was established to generate an encoding library for the development of affordable molecular identification tags operated at radiofrequency. Digital messages up to 128 bits can be encoded in the mixtures of FArs from this library (termed as Farcodes) with both reversible encryption and irreversible erasure.








Abstract
In the Internet of Things (IoT) network, radiofrequency identification (RFID) is a key enabler for wireless communication, facilitating real&#8208;time monitoring and control. A primary goal of enhancing IoT infrastructure is the development of versatile RFID tags that are of compact size, high capacity, and robust security with seamless read&#8208;write operations. Here, we report a fluorine&#8208;19 nuclear magnetic resonance (19F NMR)&#8208;based molecular encoding strategy using a fluorinated aromatics (FArs) library, termed &#8220;FArsEER&#8221; (fluorinated aromatics&#8208;empowered encoding and reading), to generate small molecule&#8208;based ID tags (Farcodes). By leveraging the structure&#8208;sensitive nature of 19F chemical shift, we developed a stepwise tuning strategy to precisely modulate 19F chemical shift via nuclear shielding. Through a simple one&#8208;step synthesis, we constructed a demonstrating platform of 64 FArs with distinct 19F chemical shifts, enabling the quick generation of binary Farcodes capable of 64&#8208;bit encoding and their facile reading and decoding with 19F NMR. Moreover, by leveraging the solvent&#8208;dependent 19F chemical shifts and hydrolysis&#8208;sensitive property, reversible encryption and irreversible erasure were further achieved with Farcodes for information security applications. With further advancements, Farcode may serve as a promising small molecule&#8208;based RFID tag for secure information storage and communication in IoT networks.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Assisted PCET and Formation of WIII&#9472;OH in Bis(Dithiolene) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single crystal structure of complex [2Et3NH&#8208;1] reveals hydrogen bonding at both W&#8208;oxo and dithiolene&#8208;S sites within the bis(dithiolene) WIV&#8208;oxo complex. This finding provides critical evidence for dithiolene's involvement in proton reactions in high&#8208;valent W&#8208;oxo complexes. Hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions promote the electrochemical formation of WIII&#9472;OH, characterized here for the first time using EPR spectroscopy.








Abstract
The redox non&#8208;innocent nature of dithiolene ligands is well known for stabilizing high&#8208;valent metal ions and facilitating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. Until now, proton reactivity at the dithiolene site has been primarily associated with low&#8208;valent metal centers, as high&#8208;valent metal&#8208;dithiolene complexes were not considered viable for such reactivity. This study introduces high&#8208;valent bis(dithiolene) tungsten (W)&#8208;oxo complexes featuring hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, unveiling a novel proton reduction mechanism mediated by the dithiolene moiety. The process begins with a nucleophilic W&#8208;oxo, forming a hydrogen bond, followed by a second hydrogen bond at the dithiolene&#8208;sulfur (S) site. These hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions significantly modulate the molecular orbital energy levels, enabling the WIV&#8594;III reduction at &#8722;1.75 V (Eexp) and allowing, for the first time, the acquisition of an EPR spectrum of a WIII&#9472;OH intermediate species. In contrast, direct electron transfer into the WIV&#9552;O state would populate the dithiolene &#960;* orbital, demanding substantially larger energy (Ecal&#160;= &#8722;3.45 V). For catalytic proton reduction, the proton transfer through the dithiolene&#8208;S site was identified as the energetically most favorable pathway for generating the WV&#9472;H catalytic species.

         <title>Engineering Robust Hydrophilic&#8211;Hydrophobic Interface via &#960;&#8208;electron Delocalization for Ultralong&#8208;Lived Zinc&#8211;Ion Batteries</title>

A &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization strategy is proposed to in&#8208;situ construct the self&#8208;assembled hydrophilic&#8211;hydrophobic interface layer (HHIL) on Zn anode after structure screening of additives. HHIL derived by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and ion&#8211;dipole interactions promote the generation of inorganic&#8208;rich interfacial chemistry during cycling. The flexible HHIL and rigid inorganic&#8208;rich interface affords the highly reversible Zn anode and ultralong&#8208;lived aqueous zinc ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) are hindered by the severe interfacial issues of Zn anode such as side reactions and dendrite growth. The in&#8208;situ construction of robust interface to tackle above issues remains a grand challenge and lacks rational design principles, especially under high current density. Herein, a &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization strategy is proposed to in&#8208;situ construct the self&#8208;assembled hydrophilic&#8211;hydrophobic interface layer (HHIL) for ultralong&#8208;lived AZIBs, where interface design principles are built based on the electronic structure and spatial configuration of additives. Encouragingly, HHIL derived by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and ion&#8211;dipole interactions is robust during long&#8208;term cycling and facilitates the generation of an inorganic&#8208;rich interface chemistry. The flexible HHIL and rigid inorganic&#8208;rich interface afford the rapid interface kinetics, and effectively suppresses side reactions and dendrite growth. Notably, Zn//Zn cells deliver the cycling life over 900 h at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8722;2, and Zn//NVO full cells stably perform over 25&#160;000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the practical pouch cell is also demonstrated.

         <title>Photoexcited Hole&#8208;Enabled Synthesis of Surface High&#8208;Valent Cobalt&#8208;Oxo Species with Water as the Oxygen Atom Source for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the synthesis of CoIV&#9552;O with H2O as the oxygen atom source under visible light irradiation. The photoexcited holes accelerate water photolysis to form cobalt&#8208;coordinated hydroxyls that then undergo deprotonation to form CoIV&#9552;O. This process is not dependent on the oxygen atom transfer (OAT) between chlorite and low&#8208;valent cobalt, challenging the traditional notion that oxidants are the sole oxygen atom donors for high&#8208;valent metal species.








Abstract
High&#8208;valent cobalt&#8208;oxo species (CoIV&#9552;O) are key intermediates in catalytic chemistry but suffer a great challenge in their efficient and mild synthesis due to the strong electronic repulsion between the cobalt center and the oxygen ligand. Herein, we report a new approach to synthesizing surface CoIV&#9552;O on the Co3O4/BiVO4 (CoBi) catalyst via a photoexcited hole&#8208;induced process using water as the oxygen atom source. The interfacial Co2+&#9472;O&#9472;Bi3+ bonds act as the atomic&#8208;level channels to directionally transport photoexcited holes driven by the internal electric field effect. It has been found that H2O was photolyzed to cobalt&#8208;coordinated hydroxyls that were turned to CoIV&#9552;O via a photoexcited hole&#8208;induced deprotonation. The isotopic labeling experiments confirmed that the oxygen atom source of CoIV&#9552;O was derived from water rather than chlorite. A synergistic effect was formed between photocatalysis and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed chlorite activation, which enhanced the degradation of sulfadiazine (SDZ) and elevated the conversion ratio of chlorite to chlorine dioxide (ClO2) from 40% to 60%. The present work has elucidated the essential role of H2O and photoexcited holes in the formation of CoIV&#9552;O and provides a viable strategy to synthesize surface high&#8208;valent metal species utilizing ubiquitous water and sunlight for water purification.

         <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalysed Acylative Kinetic and Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Planar Chiral Paracyclophanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective acylative (dynamic) kinetic resolution of racemic paracyclophanols catalysed by a chiral isothiourea (5 mol%) is described (up to s&#160;=&#160;50 at 49% conversion or up to 98:2 er and 96% yield in 30 examples). Rotational barriers were analysed for paracyclophanols and selected ester products.








Abstract
The development of synthetic methods for the catalytic enantioselective preparation of planar chiral paracyclophane derivatives is of considerable interest to the synthetic community. To date, relatively few successful and effective organocatalytic approaches to this molecular class have been reported. This manuscript describes effective isothiourea catalysed acylative kinetic (KR) and dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) approaches to the generation of a range of planar chiral paracyclophane macrocycles with excellent levels of enantioselectivity. Effective KR of configurationally stable planar chiral paracyclophanols with 12&#8208; and 13&#8208;membered ansa&#8208;chains is demonstrated (6 examples, s&#160;=&#160;up to 50) using 5 mol% of the isothiourea (R)&#8208;BTM and isobutyric anhydride. Application to configurationally labile macrocyclic phenols with 14 to 18&#8208;membered ansa&#8208;chains allows their effective acylative DKR, generating the desired products with excellent enantioselectivity (25 examples, up to 95% yield and 98:2 er).

         <title>Topologically Entangled Network Polymer Electrolyte with Ionophilic&#8211;Protonation Dual Side Chains for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A segmented polymerization strategy combining DBRP and ROP constructs a topologically entangled polymer electrolyte with ionophilic&#8211;protonation dual side chains on an electrospun skeleton. The ionophilic moieties provide abundant coordination sites, significantly enhancing Li+ transport, whereas exposed carboxyl groups induce protonation on the cathode surface via H+/Li+ exchange, thereby suppressing transition metal (TM) ion migration. Simultaneously, the topologically entangled polymer network ensures uniform electric&#8208;field distribution and continuous Li&#8314; conduction, mitigating lattice&#8208;oxygen release and enhancing structural stability under high&#8208;voltage conditions.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries (HVSSLMBs) is severely limited by unstable ion transport, insufficient oxidative stability, and poor electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface (EEI) compatibility of conventional solid electrolytes. Herein, we report a topologically entangled polymer electrolyte featuring ionophilic&#8211;protonation dual side chains. The ionophilic functional groups on these side chains provide abundant coordination sites, significantly enhancing Li+ transport, whereas exposed carboxyl (&#9472;COOH) groups induce protonation on the cathode surface, effectively suppressing transition metal (TM) ion migration. The topologically entangled polymer network ensures uniform electric&#8208;field distribution, mitigates lattice&#8208;oxygen release, and maintains continuous Li+ conduction. As a result, this electrolyte achieves a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 0.81 mS cm&#8722;1 and an oxidation stability up to 4.9&#160;V. Moreover, the in situ formed inorganic species (LiF, Li2O, and Li2CO3) stabilized the EEI, enabling stable cycling of the symmetric cell for 2000 h. Batteries assembled with a high&#8208;voltage Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.54Co0.13O2 (LRMO) cathode retain a specific capacity of 217.37 mAh g&#8722;1 after 250 cycles, and Ah&#8208;level pouch cell utilizing LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode exhibits stable cycling performance over 150 cycles. These findings demonstrate the great promise of this strategy for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries with outstanding cycling performance and long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Dynamic Evolution of Structural Ordering and Aluminum Redistribution During ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We unraveled the structural and compositional evolution of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite during crystallization, decomposed the contributions of classical and non&#8208;classical routes, and traced the thermodynamic origin of Al&#8208;zoning through theoretical calculation&#8212;validated experimentally using the syngas&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics reaction.








Abstract
Improving the comprehension of intricate crystallization processes at the molecular level is crucial for the customized design of efficient zeolite materials. However, the alternating dominance of classical and non&#8208;classical crystallization mechanisms, especially in multi&#8208;component solutions (monomers, oligomers, and amorphous particles), complicates mechanistic differentiation. Herein, we unveiled the structure and composition changes of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite at various stages via selectively removing soluble species from the synthesis solution. We revealed that highly ordered, aluminum&#8208;rich subcrystals serve as essential precursors, triggering rapid non&#8208;classical aggregation growth, followed by a ripening phase dominated by single&#8208;molecule addition. Notably, aluminum species are excluded from the aggregation growth process and reincorporated via monomer addition, accounting for the compositional heterogeneity and an aluminum&#8208;enriched surface of the final product. Remarkably, for the first time, the fact and reason behind the preferential formation of aluminum&#8208;rich nuclei, as well as the changes in Al species during the rapid growth and ripening stages have well been thoroughly verified and clarified through syngas to aromatics reaction and theoretical simulations. These findings provide valuable theoretical guidance for the directional synthesis of zeolite and the control of dynamic process variables.

         <title>Protein Secondary Structure Patterns in Short&#8208;Range Cross&#8208;Link Atlas</title>

Short&#8208;range cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) reveals secondary structure&#8208;dependent patterns in proteome&#8208;wide datasets. By integrating XL&#8208;MS data with AlphaFold&#8208;predicted structures, we introduce X&#8208;SPAN, a novel validation metric that assesses data quality and enables pLDDT score benchmarking.








Abstract
Cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) has become a powerful tool in structural biology for investigating protein structure, dynamics, and interactomics. However, short&#8208;range cross&#8208;links, defined as those connecting residues fewer than 20 positions apart, have traditionally been considered less informative and largely overlooked, leaving significant data unexplored in a systematic manner. Here, we present a system&#8208;wide analysis of short&#8208;range cross&#8208;links, demonstrating their intrinsic correlation with protein secondary structure. We introduce the X&#8208;SPAN (Cross&#8208;link Structural Pattern Analyzer) software, which integrates publicly available XL&#8208;MS datasets from system&#8208;wide experiments with AlphaFold&#8208;predicted protein structures. Our analysis reveals distinct cross&#8208;linking patterns that reflect the spatial constraints imposed by secondary structural elements. Specifically, &#945;&#8208;helices exhibit periodic cross&#8208;linking patterns consistent with their characteristic helical pitch, whereas coils and &#946;&#8208;strands display nearly monotonic distributions. A context&#8208;dependent protein grammar reinforces short&#8208;range cross&#8208;link specificity. Short&#8208;range cross&#8208;links can enhance the statistical inference of secondary structures within integrative modeling workflows. Additionally, our work establishes a framework for benchmarking AlphaFold's local prediction accuracy and provides novel quality control criteria for XL&#8208;MS experiments. We anticipate that X&#8208;SPAN and our short&#8208;range cross&#8208;link database will serve as a valuable resource for exploring local secondary structure rearrangements and their potential roles in protein function and allosteric regulation.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controlled Dynamics of Cholesteric Polymer Coatings via Hydrazone Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present an innovative approach, which integrates responsive molecules into larger ensembles, resulting in photo&#8208;controllable and photo&#8208;patternable colors. By covalently coupling hydrazone photoswitches with supramolecular helical polymer networks, we harness light&#8208;driven molecular shape changes to modulate structural color. Our multilength scale design enables macroscopic level function and potential applications in tunable photonics and optics. 








Abstract
Developing responsive coatings and materials requires discovering a breadth of mechanisms by which external stimuli can be converted into useful signals. Here, we demonstrate an approach driven by supramolecular mechanochemistry, where mechanical input&#8212;molecular shape change&#8212;is translated into structural color variation. By embedding bistable, negatively photochromic hydrazone photoswitches into cholesteric polymer networks, we achieve a reversible, stable color shift through molecular&#8208;scale pulling and pushing of the photonic scaffold. Unlike azobenzene&#8208;based systems, which typically disrupt liquid crystal order, this approach modifies the pitch of a cross&#8208;linked cholesteric helix without disrupting the organisation of the material. The long&#8208;lived stability of both hydrazone isomers ensures durable optical switching. This effect provides a new strategy for designing mechanoresponsive photonic coatings and tunable optical materials.

         <title>Unveiling Nonadiabatic Pathways in Small Molecule Activation: Dinuclear Uranium&#8208;Mediated H2 and N2 Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical calculations reveal that nonadiabatic pathways in small molecule activation are mediated by the dual functionality of the transition state, acting as both a thermodynamic s addle point and a nonadiabatic channel, which facilitates spin downshifts between degenerate electronic states. The &#960; and &#963; cooperative activation explains the unprecedented reactivity by the diuranium cooperation.








Abstract
Nonadiabatic effects have been extensively studied in photoexcited processes, but their role in thermal process so far has neither been thoroughly studied nor appreciated, despite their significance. In this work, H2 and N2 activation mediated by a diuranium complex was studied from a nonadiabatic perspective using multi&#8211;configurational ab initio calculations combined with density functional theory. Stepwise electron transfer during the reaction enhances degeneracy between electronic states, enabling state&#8208;to&#8208;state transitions, i.e., spin downshift. The dual functionality of transition states acting as thermodynamic gateways and channels for nonadiabatic transitions was disclosed. The &#960; and &#963; cooperative activation explains the unprecedented reactivity by the diuranium cooperation. Bonding analysis reveals that U5f/6d orbitals mixing with H1s/N2p orbitals afford some degree of covalency to the primarily ionic U&#9472;H/N interactions, with the 6d&#8208;orbitals contributing more pronounced than the 5f&#8208;orbitals in &#963; interactions, while the U&#9472;N &#960; bonding exhibits significant U5f contributions.

         <title>Deuterating Narrow&#8208;Bandgap Organic Semiconductors for Sensitive Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deuteration strategy is employed to universally suppress nonradiative decay pathways in narrow&#8208;bandgap organic semiconductors. Compared to their protonated counterparts, deuterated molecules exhibit lower stretching vibrational frequencies, enhanced exciton dissociation efficiency, and reduced photogenerated carrier recombination, thereby improving the responsivity and specific detectivity of short&#8208;wave infrared photodetectors.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors exhibit significant potential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic technologies owing to their structural tunability and solution processability; nevertheless, as their bandgap decreases, the nonradiative recombination for either exciton or photogenerated charge&#8208;carriers increases, limiting short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photoresponse, as governed by energy gap law. Here, a deuteration strategy is employed to universally reduce the nonradiative decay pathways of SWIR organic semiconductors, enhancing photodetector sensitivity. Compared to protonated L4, the rational deuterated molecule (BT&#8208;12D) maintains SWIR photoresponse to &#8764;1.7&#160;&#181;m and exhibits lower stretching vibrational frequency (2350&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;vs. 3063&#160;cm&#8722;1), resulting in reduced recombination and 40% increase in specific detectivity (D*) at 1.3&#160;&#181;m for PDPPDTP: BT&#8208;12D&#8208;based organic photodetectors (OPDs). Likewise, deuterated L2&#8208;eC9&#8208;10D&#8208;based OPDs blending with PTB7&#8208;Th exhibit 14% higher D* (1.24&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones at 1.2&#160;&#181;m) and faster rise/fall time (1.0/1.2&#160;&#181;s) than protonated devices (1.09&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones; 1.6/1.7&#160;&#181;s). The optimized D* of deuterated OPDs is comparable to and even better than those of commercial detectors at 0.9&#8211;1.2&#160;&#181;m, while the corresponding response time is the fastest value reported for SWIR OPDs. These results highlight the broad applicability of deuteration as an effective strategy to suppress nonradiative decay pathways in SWIR organic semiconductors, unlocking new opportunities for sensitive SWIR optoelectronics.

         <title>Identification of Ti(salen) Complexes for Efficient Catalysis in Single&#8208;Electron Steps by Cyclic Voltammetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst screening without catalysis. By combining cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations we were able to identify a highly active catalyst for the radical arylation of epoxides without performing any reactions. The prevention of chloride binding that leads to catalyst inhibition was established as the key structural feature. Our best catalyst is applicable for a broad variety of substrates after electrochemical or chemical activation.








Abstract
We describe the identification of an active Ti(salen) catalyst for the radical arylation of epoxides by a cyclic voltammetry study of mechanism&#8208;based predictors, such as the redox potentials of the complexes and their EqCr&#8208;equilibria, for the success of catalysis. Surprisingly, by far the most active catalyst features an uncommon tetrasubstituted ligand backbone, which renders chloride binding to the active Ti(III) species less favorable, thereby increasing catalyst activity due to improved substrate binding. Catalysis is most efficient in the &#8220;green&#8221; solvent ethyl acetate and can be initiated using base metals as well as electrochemical methods for the reduction of the Ti(salen)&#8208;precatalyst. Compared to the commonly employed titanocene catalysis, the use of the newly developed Ti(salen) catalyst allows for the use of milder and more sustainable reactions conditions, a broader substrate scope, and facile modification of the catalyst's electronic and steric properties.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Selective Cross&#8208;Linking of Primary and Secondary Alkyl Amines with CS2 Under Ambient Aerobic Oxidation for Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet highly effective bioconjugation strategy enables the near&#8208;perfect hetero&#8208;selective cross&#8208;linking of primary and secondary alkyl amines using CS2 under mild conditions.








Abstract
Umpolung of primary amines via isothiocyanation presents an attractive approach for cross&#8208;linking biorelevant molecules through two nucleophilic handles. However, conventional isothiocyanation reactions typically require highly electrophilic reagents or strongly oxidative conditions, rendering them unsuitable for complex molecular systems. Herein, we present a robust and nonchemist&#8208;friendly protocol for the isothiocyanation of primary alkyl amines using CS2 under ambient aerobic oxidation conditions, eliminating the need for additional promoters. These mild conditions not only ensure broad compatibility with endogenous functional groups in biorelevant molecules but also unlock a powerful new capability: selective differentiation between primary and secondary alkyl amines. Notably, the unique suppression of homo&#8208;linking for both primary and secondary amines under these conditions enables near&#8208;perfect hetero&#8208;selectivity in cross&#8208;linking two different biorelevant molecules via their abundant amino handles in a one&#8208;pot operation, offering a streamlined, thiol&#8208;independent, and small&#8208;footprint approach to biocompatible conjugation.

These mild conditions not only ensure broad compatibility with endogenous functional groups in biorelevant molecules but also unlock a powerful new capability: selective differentiation between primary and secondary alkyl amines. Notably, the unique suppression of homo-linking for both primary and secondary amines under these conditions enables near-perfect hetero-selectivity in cross-linking two different biorelevant molecules via their abundant amino handles in a one-pot operation, offering a streamlined, thiol-independent, and small-footprint approach to biocompatible conjugation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Diazo Linker Ligand Promotes Flexibility and Induced Fit Binding in a Microporous Copper Coordination Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of three isostructural coordination networks differs only in the central part of the linker ligand. Whereas a linker comprising an azo bond enabled guest&#8208;induced structural flexibility, including induced fit behavior, networks containing linkers with hydrocarbon moieties were observed to be rigid upon exposure to the same guests.








Abstract
Flexible organic linkers represent an intuitive and effective strategy to design flexible metal&#8211;organic materials. We report herein a systematic study concerning the effect of varying the central bond of mixed pyridyl&#8208;benzoate linkers, L, upon the flexibility of three isostructural kdd topology microporous coordination networks (CNs) of formula ML2: X&#8208;kdd&#8208;1&#8208;Cu, 1 = L = (E)&#8208;4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yldiazenyl)benzoate; X&#8208;kdd&#8208;2&#8208;Cu, 2 = L = (E)&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)benzoate; the previously reported X&#8208;kdd&#8208;3&#8208;Cu, 3 = L = 4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ylethynyl)benzoate. As revealed by single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and gas sorption studies, X&#8208;kdd&#8208;1&#8208;Cu, exhibited gate&#8208;opening during CO2 and hydrocarbon (C2 and C8) sorption experiments whereas the other two CNs did not. Insight into these phase transformations was gained from in situ variable&#8208;pressure and variable temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), SCXRD, and modeling. Rotation of ligand 1 around the diazo bond, torsion angle changes between phenyl and carboxylate moieties, and deformation of the Cu&#8208;based rod building blocks enabled activated X&#8208;kdd&#8208;1&#8208;Cu to form new phases with C8 isomers and CH2Cl2, CH2Cl2 inducing contraction of the activated phase. Computational studies suggest that 1 enables flexibility thanks to its lower barrier of deformation versus 2 or 3. This study teaches that diazo moieties could offer a general strategy to enhance the flexibility of CNs.

         <title>Activatable Fluorescence/Photoacoustic Macromolecular Probe for Imaging of Tumor&#8208;Associated Natural Killer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF)/photoacoustic (PA) macromolecular probe is developed based on the optimized fluorophore scaffold with a long absorption maximum and high PA brightness. This probe enables dual&#8208;mode noninvasive, real&#8208;time in vivo monitoring of tumor&#8208;associated natural killer cells in the tumor immune microenvironment.








Abstract
Detection of tumor&#8208;associated natural killer cells (TANKs) is crucial for evaluating cancer immunotherapy because they are found to be associated with improved overall survival rate. However, existing analytical methods relying on tissue biopsy are invasive and static, restricting their capacity to deliver dynamic information. Herein, we report an activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF)/photoacoustic (PA) macromolecular reporter (BhCyNK) for real&#8208;time imaging of TANKs. To optimize the PA performance, the fluorophore scaffold of BhCyNK is screened. Among four hemicyanine derivatives, BhCyS with the longest absorption maximum (&#8764;800&#160;nm) as well as the highest photothermal conversion efficiency (71.13%) and PA brightness is constructed into BhCyNK, which specifically triggers its NIRF signal (by 10&#8208;fold increase) and PA signal (by 8.3&#8208;fold increase) in the presence of a TANK&#8208;overexpressed protease. BhCyNK effectively distinguishes natural killer cells from other immune cells including T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. The high specificity of BhCyNK enables real&#8208;time monitoring of TANKs population in the tumor of living mice amid cancer immunotherapies. The imaging results reveal that the increasing intratumoral signal of BhCyNK after combination immunotherapy correlates well with the increasing population of TANKs. Thus, this study not only reports a molecular strategy to develop efficient PA fluorophores but also provides an ideal tool for noninvasive monitoring of immune cells.

         <title>MOF Coating Enhances the Ion Tolerance of Micromotors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reported a novel method to significantly enhance the ion tolerance of EMNMs using a MOF coating via controllable heteroepitaxial growth, enabling effective motion in high&#8208;salt environments and propulsion through biological tissues under 980&#160;nm NIR light, with potential applications in targeted drug delivery.








Abstract
Electrophoretic&#8208;driven micro/nanomotors (EMNMs) offer great potential for biomedical applications due to their design flexibility. However, they face challenges in high&#8208;salt environments, where ionic quenching disrupts propulsion by collapsing the electrical double layer. This study introduces a versatile strategy by coating EMNMs with a MOF porous scaffold (ZIF&#8208;8), which acts as ion&#8208;conductive channels that replace the electrical Debye layers and support propulsion in high&#8208;salt solutions. Through a heteroepitaxial growth process, ZIF&#8208;8 was precisely coated on silicon micromotors, a typical model for EMNMs, significantly enhancing their ion tolerance. By optimizing both the MOF layer and the geometry factor, the micromotors achieved effective motion in PBS solution, comparable to blood salt levels, with their ion tolerance (EI50) improving by up to 266 times compared to uncoated micromotors. Additionally, the micromotors maintained stable, controllable motion under 980&#160;nm NIR light, even when passing through an artificial blood vessel covered with biological tissues. In addition, the ZIF&#8208;8 coating offers drug&#8208;loading capabilities and pH&#8208;responsive release, along with biocompatibility, making these micromotors suitable for targeted drug delivery. This MOF coating strategy is versatile and scalable, and can be extended to other types of EMNMs, significantly enhancing their ion tolerance and unlocking new possibilities for biomedical applications.

         <title>Uniform Half&#8208;Substituted Chiral Arylcycloparaphenylene: Synthesis, Crystal Structure, and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized the first uniform half&#8208;aryl&#8208;functionalized chiral nanohoop, [6]CPP&#8208;12tBuPh. It demonstrated strong circularly polarized luminescence with a good luminescence dissymmetry factor and interesting aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior.








Abstract
The strategic implementation of aryl&#8208;functionalization in every phenyl group in organic architectures presents a transformative approach to constructing novel molecular nanocarbon materials. In this present work, we demonstrate the first synthesis of a uniform and chiral half&#8208;aryl substituted cycloparaphenylene (CPP), [6]CPP&#8208;12tBuPh. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously confirms its hoop&#8208;shaped structure and the existence of planar chirality arising from stereochemically distinct substituent orientations. The resolved pS and pR enantiomers display mirror&#8208;imaged circular dichroism (CD) signals and a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum| = 2.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;2). Photophysical characterization reveals the emergence of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, with pure [6]CPP&#8208;12tBuPh powder sample exhibiting intense orange fluorescence.

         <title>Substrate Preorganization Within Photoactive Pt12L24 Nanospheres for Accelerated Decarboxylation Catalysis at Low Concentrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate preorganization is used to overcome the concentration and lifetime constraints of photoredox catalysis. Pt12L24 nanospheres equipped with guanidinium moieties (LGua) are able to preorganize carboxylic acids and act as photocatalysts for the decarboxylative oxygenation reaction. Substrate preorganization accelerates the photochemical rate by two orders of magnitude, which allows efficient photoredox catalysis at 2 &#181;M concentrations.








Abstract
Photoredox catalysis with short&#8208;excited state lifetimes or in dilute conditions is challenging because the photochemical mechanism relies on collisions within the excited state of the photocatalyst. In this work, we use supramolecular substrate preorganization within Pt12L24 nanospheres as strategy to perform photoredox catalysis at low concentrations. We show that Pt12L24 nanospheres are efficient photocatalysts for the decarboxylative oxygenation reaction. Nanospheres with endo&#8208;functionalized guanidinium groups (Pt12LGua24) preorganize the substrate, which increases the catalytic turnover frequency by two orders of magnitude. Crucially, this preorganization ensures that Pt12LGua24 retains its photocatalytic activity at extremely low concentrations (2 &#181;M). This strategy thus overcomes the concentration limitations of photoredox catalysis and may be interesting for applications in dilute environments such as water purification and cellular photocatalysis.

         <title>Multiply Substituted (Hetero)acenes Containing Phosphonate Group at the Central Unit as High&#8208;Efficiency Light Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new variant of the Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8211;Bradsher (F&#8208;C&#8208;B) reaction is the source of multiply substituted (hetero)acenes with a critical (RO)2P(O) group, which showed significantly higher quantum yields (QYs) than previously observed and substituent&#8208;dependent color control ability. The highest QYs were due to the hybrid character of the electron excitation mechanism involving dominant local excitation (LE) and a 30% charge transfer (CT) contribution.








Abstract
A new variant of the Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8211;Bradsher (F&#8208;C&#8208;B) reaction offers access to dialkoxyphosphoryl substituted (hetero)acenes, especially to previously unavailable three&#8208; to seven&#8208;substituted, tri&#8208; and tetracyclic compounds, and features high chemical yields up to 95%, excellent photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (QYs) up to 87.7%, large Stokes shifts up to 7943 cm&#8722;1, and very mild, room temperature reaction conditions. The (RO)2P(O) has a distinct effect on the photophysical properties of acenes, increasing QYs by more than twofold compared to identical acenes not substituted by this group. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, combined with electron&#8208;hole analysis, indicated that local excitation (LE) had the dominant contribution to the electron excitation mechanism, and charge transfer (CT) of about 30% provided the highest fluorescence QYs. The multiple substitutions of (hetero)acenes bearing phosphonate moieties and electron&#8208;diverse substituents combined with a lower number of fused aromatic rings appear to be ideal for optimal chemical stability and high PL. The new, synthetic tool will accelerate exploitation of bulky (hetero)acene emitters for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydroarylation of Allenes: Formal Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Rhazinilam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of allene&#8208;tethered pyrroles and indoles that provides access to relevant heterocyclic systems bearing vinyl&#8208;substituted 3ry or 4ry stereocenters is reported. Its synthetic potential was exemplified with a very short, highly enantioselective formal synthesis of (+)&#8208;Rhazinilam, whereas DFT computational studies allowed to rationalize the key factors that control the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the process.








Abstract
We report a versatile, highly enantioselective intramolecular hydroarylation of allenyl&#8208;tethered pyrroles and indoles. The reaction, promoted by an iridium(I)/bisphosphine chiral catalyst, provides a direct access heteropolycyclic systems bearing either tertiary or quaternary carbon stereocenters and a synthetically appealing alkenyl pendant. The method allows a highly efficient assembly of five&#8208;, six&#8208; and even seven&#8208;membered fused indole and pyrrole products, providing enantiomeric excesses of up to 99%. DFT computational studies align nicely with the experimental results and allow to rationalize the key factors that control both regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the process. Finally, the synthetic potential of the method was exemplified with a very short, highly enantioselective formal synthesis of (+)&#8208;Rhazinilam.

The molecular structure of olefin polymerization activator methylaluminoxane (MAO) was probed using ultrahigh field solid&#8208;state NMR backed with DFT calculations, revealing its key motifs and reactive centers.









Abstract
The structure and reactivity of methylaluminoxane (MAO), a reagent of major interest for olefin polymerization, both industrially and academically, has been probed using ultrahigh magnetic field solid&#8208;state NMR (28.2 T, 1200 MHz for 1H Larmor frequency). High resolution methods combined with density functional calculations allowed for the identification and quantification of five major aluminum sites, providing precise information on the structure of MAO at the molecular level. Based on reactivity studies with THF and [ZrCp2Me2], the main reactive centers are identified as bismethyl aluminum species stabilized via a bridging methyl group from a neighboring Al center, featuring both high chemical shift and quadrupolar coupling constants (162 ppm and 27.4 MHz, respectively). This approach demonstrates the ability to monitor the chemistry of MAO with unprecedented precision, enabling a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art understanding of its structure and reactivity.

         <title>Supramolecular Structure Enabled Photo&#8208;Responsive Charge Transport in Porphyrin&#8208;Based Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A remarkable reduction of charge transport in a molecular junction under light illumination is realized in the self&#8208;assembled monolayers composed of porphyrin&#8208;based supramolecular cages. The efficient electron&#8208;hole pair separation in the excited TPyP cages, combined with the increased energy offset, collectively contributes to the notable reduction in conductance under light illumination.








Abstract
Supramolecular electronics offers a valuable opportunity to fabricate functional devices with tunable charge transport (CT) behaviors. Their diverse and non&#8208;covalent structures allow for precise modulation of CT with external stimuli. Despite their potential, achieving effective CT modulation in supramolecules through external stimuli remains challenging due to a lack of rigid systems with a predictable response to such stimuli. To address this challenge, we explore the use of porphyrin&#8208;based supramolecular structures and their CT responses to light illumination. By incorporating rigid ligands to increase the spatial distance between two porphyrin units, we diminish their interactions, fabricating porphyrin&#8208;contained cages that exhibit a higher efficiency of electron&#8208;hole pair separation compared to the monomer in solid state. Leveraging this advantage, a more effective photo&#8208;responsive CT is achieved for cages in solid&#8208;state junctions compared to that of monomers. The current through cage junctions reduces upon illumination. Theoretical calculations indicate that the reduction in conductivity arises from an increased energy offset between the molecule and electrode under light irradiation. Moreover, the photo&#8208;responsive CT can be finely tuned by adjusting the metal ion coordinated within the porphyrin and the distance between the cage and the electrode. This research paves a new way for developing supramolecular optoelectronic devices.

     alt="Supramolecular Structure Enabled Photo-Responsive Charge Transport in Porphyrin-Based Junctions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A remarkable reduction of charge transport in a molecular junction under light illumination is realized in the self-assembled monolayers composed of porphyrin-based supramolecular cages. The efficient electron-hole pair separation in the excited TPyP cages, combined with the increased energy offset, collectively contributes to the notable reduction in conductance under light illumination.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular electronics offers a valuable opportunity to fabricate functional devices with tunable charge transport (CT) behaviors. Their diverse and non-covalent structures allow for precise modulation of CT with external stimuli. Despite their potential, achieving effective CT modulation in supramolecules through external stimuli remains challenging due to a lack of rigid systems with a predictable response to such stimuli. To address this challenge, we explore the use of porphyrin-based supramolecular structures and their CT responses to light illumination. By incorporating rigid ligands to increase the spatial distance between two porphyrin units, we diminish their interactions, fabricating porphyrin-contained cages that exhibit a higher efficiency of electron-hole pair separation compared to the monomer in solid state. Leveraging this advantage, a more effective photo-responsive CT is achieved for cages in solid-state junctions compared to that of monomers. The current through cage junctions reduces upon illumination. Theoretical calculations indicate that the reduction in conductivity arises from an increased energy offset between the molecule and electrode under light irradiation. Moreover, the photo-responsive CT can be finely tuned by adjusting the metal ion coordinated within the porphyrin and the distance between the cage and the electrode. This research paves a new way for developing supramolecular optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A kind of anhydride&#8208;based three&#8208;motif molecular junction covalent organic frameworks has been successfully synthesized through a melt polymerization method that can serve as dual&#8208;electrode active materials for symmetric all&#8208;organic batteries.








Abstract
The symmetric all&#8208;organic batteries (SAOBs) based on the same organic electrode materials for both cathode and anode are promising in achieving an efficient battery system with excellent electrode compatibility, compensable volume change, full discharge ability, low preparation cost, and simple operation procedure, etc. Herein, for the first time, we have designed a kind of anhydride&#8208;based three&#8208;motif molecular junction COFs (i.e., TAT&#8208;AZO&#8208;COF) through a melt polymerization method that can serve as dual&#8208;electrode active materials for SAOBs. The prepared TAT&#8208;AZO&#8208;COF with three&#8208;motif molecular junction units, resulting from the integration of a cathode&#8208;active carbonyl group, an anode&#8208;active azo group, and a changeably bipolar&#8208;active triazin group, could provide a tunable voltage inductive effect to simultaneously meet the requirements of SAOBs. Thus&#8208;assembled SAOBs display excellent rate performance, high energy density (125&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) at 1 A g&#8722;1 and superior long&#8208;cycle property (90 mAh g&#8722;1 over 10&#160;000 cycles) at 10 A g&#8722;1, which is represented to be the best high&#8208;current density performance among all the organic electrode materials in dual&#8208;electrode available SAOBs. The Li+ storage mechanisms of three&#8208;motif molecular junction COFs are thoroughly scrutinized by experimental and theoretical identification, and the feasibility in practical application has been validated by a successfully assembled pouch cell.

         <title>Photoswitchable Antimicrobial Metallohelices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optically pure, azobenzene bridged metallohelices can be prepared by chiral subcomponent self&#8208;assembly. They can be photoisomerized from an elongated, relatively inactive form to a compact, folded and potent antimicrobial, and vice versa.








Abstract
Chiral subcomponent self&#8208;assembly is used to access optically pure, metallo&#8208;helical species based on Zn and Fe(II) and incorporating three transazobenzene units. UV&#8211;vis, circular dichroism, and NMR spectroscopies, alongside X&#8208;ray crystallographic and DFT computational studies are used to unambiguously characterize a highly reversible stepwise photochemical transformation to an all&#8208;cis state in which structural integrity and optical purity have been retained. Although the all&#8208;trans state of the water&#8208;soluble enantiomers exhibited low or moderate activity against Gram&#8208;positive strains, irradiation at 365&#160;nm led to up to eight&#8208;fold reduction in MIC. Electron microscopy and a cell permeability assay indicate a membrane disruption mechanism; the higher activity of the photochemically&#8208;generated all&#8208;cis state is consistent with its more compact supramolecular fold.

         <title>Fully Conjugated Sp2 Carbon&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks Enables Accelerated Exciton Process for Superior Singlet Oxygen Photosynthesis for Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing fully conjugated sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs, a facile strategy was proposed to regulate the exciton interaction and intersystem crossing (ISC) process, which significantly enhances Coulomb interaction, promotes ISC and pushes forward the transfer of excitons to the O2 adsorption sites throughout the COFs matrix, thereby enabling a record&#8208;high singlet oxygen yield with 100% selectivity.








Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen (O2) activation via energy transfer offers a sustainable approach for singlet oxygen (1O2) synthesis, while its performance suffers from the ultrafast exciton dissociation and sluggish intersystem crossing (ISC) process. Up to date, exciton regulation is still in its infancy. Here, via linkage engineering of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), we propose a fully conjugated sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs (sp2c&#8208;Py&#8208;Bpy COFs) with strong exciton interaction and fast ISC for boosted 1O2 photosynthesis. The sp2c&#8208;Py&#8208;Bpy COFs delivers a record&#8208;high 1O2 yield (624 &#181;M min&#8722;1) with 100% selectivity, which is ca. eight times that of the traditional imine&#8208;bridged COFs (Im&#8208;Py&#8208;Bpy COFs, ca. 95.8% selectivity), outperforming documented systems. Transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the fully conjugated sp2 carbon linkage of sp2c&#8208;Py&#8208;Bpy COFs can enhance Coulomb interaction, promote ISC and push forward the transfer of triplet exciton to the O2 adsorption sites throughout the COFs matrix, jointly facilitating the energy transfer process for efficient 1O2 photosynthesis and bypassing the traditional electron transfer process. Hence, sp2c&#8208;Py&#8208;Bpy COFs can selectively degrade acetaminophen within minutes under visible light irradiation and enables stable degradation of emerging pollutants in a continuous flow membrane reactor (20&#160;&#215;&#160;30&#160;&#215; 2&#160;cm) utilizing natural sunlight and dissolved O2.

         <title>Reverse the Impact of Le Chatelier's Principle in Two&#8208;Electron Air Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has challenged traditional Le Chatelier's principle by developing a catalyst system that can reverse the impact of N2 in direct air electroreduction, demonstrating exceptional hydrogen peroxide yield rates and Faradaic efficiencies even rivalling its high&#8208;purity O2 counterpart.








Abstract
Using high&#8208;purity oxygen (O2) for electrofixation would increase the production cost of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) because of requiring complex pre&#8208;treatment procedures. Atmospheric air is an abundant source, but the direct air electrofixation has proved to be very challenging, that in common conception against nitrogen (N2) in the system. According to the Le Chatelier's principle, O2 concentration is diluted by N2 (78%) in atmospheric air, which reduces overall reaction rates/equilibrium. Here we report a catalyst system where the presence of N2 does not impose an adverse effect; rather, it is beneficial for activity. We combine both theoretical and experimental analyses to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, unlocking the critical function of electronic spin, arising from the strong synergy between iron oxide (FeOx) and nickel&#8208;metal organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;MOF) that optimizes the activation of O2 in air. Consequently, the catalyst for direct air electrofixation has demonstrated an exceptional H2O2 yield rate (262.6&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and Faradaic efficiency (95.61%), outperforming its high&#8208;purity O2 counterpart (184.32&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 67.06%). We expect the present findings providing an additional dimension to leverage systems beyond the constraint of traditional rules.

&lt;/i&gt;) and nickel-metal organic frameworks (Ni-MOF) that optimizes the activation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in air. Consequently, the catalyst for direct air electrofixation has demonstrated an exceptional H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate (262.6&#160;mg h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and Faradaic efficiency (95.61%), outperforming its high-purity O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; counterpart (184.32&#160;mg&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 67.06%). We expect the present findings providing an additional dimension to leverage systems beyond the constraint of traditional rules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermally Triggered Redox Flexibility of Pt/CeO2 Cluster Catalyst Against In&#8208;Situ Atomic Redispersion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic redispersion of aggregated metal sites is particularly significant in catalyst dynamics. However, this evolution still lacks in&#8208;depth understanding and is usually accompanied by a saturated coordination environment of metal atoms, leading to inferior catalytic activity. Via high&#8208;temperature thermal aging at 800&#160;&#176;C, the surface hydroxyls are largely removed, and then the cluster structure is maintained. The well&#8208;preserved Pt/CeO2 cluster catalyst delivers high catalytic activity, which shows promising prospects in the oxidative elimination of many other volatile organic compounds.








Abstract
For supported catalysts, the redispersion of aggregated metal sites into single atoms is dictated by the reactant&#8208;induced metal&#8208;support interaction, which may also deteriorate the intrinsic activity. Here we discovered the spontaneous redispersion of CeO2&#8208;supported Pt clusters into Pt single atoms during catalytic CO oxidation, driven by Pt&#8208;CeO2 interaction with surface hydroxyls as the key stabilizer. This structural evolution was accompanied by deactivation, leading to inferior catalytic activity. After achieving the clear distinction of PtOx clusters and Pt single atoms, we propose a thermal aging strategy to preserve the Pt clusters against redispersion. The high&#8208;temperature calcination at 800&#160;&#176;C significantly removed the surface hydroxyls of Pt/CeO2, thereby eliminating the anchoring sites for Pt redispersion and consequently preserving the Pt clusters. Moreover, the Ce3+/Ce4+ redox cycles were triggered, enabling the interfacial Ce3+ sites to fulfill O2 activation. Together with the enhanced CO adsorption on Pt clusters over single atoms, this redox flexibility in valence change delivered superior activity for CO oxidation.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction of Aliphatic Alcohol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction of aliphatic mesylates is reported. This reaction provides a strategy for late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive compounds that have high F(sp3). Preliminary mechanistic experiments confirm a stereoablative reaction outcome, consistent with alkyl radical intermediates. Application in an enantioselective transformation is demonstrated for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;aryl glutaramides.








Abstract
Reactions leveraging readily available starting materials are valuable for synthetic utility, especially for late&#8208;stage functionalization. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling (XC) reaction of aliphatic sulfonates with aryl boronic acids. This reaction provides straightforward access to an array of arylated products in good yield. We have established a one&#8208;pot protocol allowing for the arylation of alcohols in a single reaction vessel. Additionally, an asymmetric reaction was developed to provide enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;aryl and heteroaryl glutarimides in good yield and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Nucleation and Growth Mechanisms of Micro/Nano Structural Manganese&#8208;Trimesic Acid Coordinations for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on crystal nucleation and growth theory, this study systematically investigated the patterns of MnBTC chemical structure and morphology under different experimental conditions, thoroughly revealing its intrinsic nucleation and growth mechanisms. The successful construction of ML models provides valuable references for the future development of MOFs. Additionally, the study systematically examines the impact of different MnBTC morphologies on the electrochemical performance of AZIBs. The research findings provide experimental support for the controllable synthesis of MOF materials, opening new avenues for their application in efficient energy storage.








Abstract
Nucleation and growth of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are critical for controlling their morphology, size, and performance. Guided by the crystal nucleation and growth theory, this study systematically explored the effects of the sequential addition of ligand trimesic acid (BTC) and manganese ions (Mn2+), ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal ion ratio, solvent composition, and surfactants on the nucleation and growth of MnBTC. The regulatory mechanisms of the crystal morphology and internal structure were deeply revealed. Moreover, the established machine learning (ML) model can accurately predict the concentrations of &#9472;COO&#8722; and Mn2+, providing important guidance for the controlled synthesis of MOFs in the future. In practical, the electrochemical performance of MnBTC with different morphologies and sizes was evaluated for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The reaction mechanism of MnBTC during the charge&#8211;discharge process was investigated through a series of in situ and ex situ characterizations, and MnBTC demonstrated excellent energy&#8208;storage performance. This study opens a new window for the precise synthesis of MOFs, which show strongly controlled micro/nano structure and coordination environment based on the crystal nucleation and growth theory with the assistance of ML.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;X and C&#9472;H Borylation of Aryl Halides for the Synthesis of Bis(boronate)benzenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides a general and cost&#8208;efficient route for accessing bis&#8208;borylated arenes from structure&#8208;diverse and readily available aryl halides via simultaneous C&#9472;X and C&#9472;H borylation using a titanium catalyst. Mechanistic and DFT studies revealed an unprecedented reaction mechanism driven by aryl radical, generated from the aryl halides' interaction with in situ formed Cp2Ti(II) and tBuOLi.








Abstract
Despite the intensive studies on the synthesis and application of aryl boronates, most focus on mono&#8208;borylated arenes. The multi&#8208;borylated arenes, on the other hand, have received much less attention because the preparation of multi&#8208;borylated arenes in a straightforward manner is still underdeveloped. Herein, we present our findings on synthesizing bis&#8208;borylated arenes from structure&#8208;diverse and readily available aryl halides (Ar&#9472;X, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I). Simultaneous C&#9472;X and C&#9472;H borylation of aryl halides is achieved using earth&#8208;abundant titanium as a catalyst. Not only the 1,2&#8208;bis borylation but also the 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;bis borylation are achieved. Control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) computations propose a titanium&#8208;mediated aryl radical&#8208;driven reaction resulting in selective bis&#8208;borylation over mono&#8208;borylation.

         <title>Guest Polarizability Directed Molecular &#8220;Freezing&#8221; Within Non&#8208;metal Porous Salt Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guest polarizability&#8208;directed molecular &#8220;freezing&#8221; of noble gas occurs within a non&#8208;metal porous organic ammonium salt framework bearing well&#8208;organized, high&#8208;density chloride anions as nodes. The rare commensurate adsorption toward Xe with high polarizability, combined with the confinement effect of the framework, results in exceptional dynamic Xe/Kr separation with record selectivity.








Abstract
Isoreticular non&#8208;metal salt frameworks with permanent porosity have emerged recently as a fantastic platform for molecular separation, but the underlying guest&#8208;framework interactions within their charge&#8208;separated ionic channels remain to be explored. Here, we report the first case of guest polarizability&#8208;directed molecular &#8220;freezing&#8221; of noble gas occurring within a non&#8208;metal porous organic ammonium framework, which bears well&#8208;organized, high&#8208;density chloride anions as nodes. Notably, the framework exhibits a distinctive, thermally&#8208;independent commensurate adsorption toward highly polarizable Xe, while traditional thermodynamic adsorption behaviors are observed for Kr with lower polarizability. A remarkable Xe adsorption capacity of 1.47&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 and a record&#8208;high separation factor of 10.2 are thus achieved in dynamic Xe/Kr separation under ambient conditions. The practical potential for realistic Xe/Kr separation from the off&#8208;gas of used nuclear fuel (UNF) reprocessing is demonstrated. Theoretical calculations identify the presence of multiple strong Xe&#8943;Cl interactions as the driving force within the size&#8208;matching ionic channels of the salt framework.

         <title>Large N&#8208;Doped Zigzag Hydrocarbon Belts from Calixarenes: Synthesis, Structure, and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zigzag molecular nanobelts inlaid with nitrogen atoms and carbonyl groups around portals were synthesized from calix[8]arenes. The synthesis features one&#8208;pot multiple intermolecular fjord&#8208;stitching C&#9472;N bond cross&#8208;coupling reactions and selective methylene oxidation reactions. The belt molecules adopt an octagonal prism shape of a large cavity, and are capable of complexing C60 or C70.








Abstract
Zigzag hydrocarbon belts and heteroatom&#8208;doped analogs have captivated chemists because of their unique structures, tantalizing properties, and potential applications. Despite synthetic breakthroughs, the diversity, especially, the size of belts synthesized by fjord&#8208;stitching approach is limited by resorcin[n]arenes (n&#160;=&#160;4, 6). We report herein the synthesis, structure and properties of large belts starting from conventional calix[8]arenes. The synthesis features multiple C&#9472;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions of per&#8208;brominated calix[8]arenes with anilines and ammonia, and selective transformation of 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline into quinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;one segments. The molecules in question adopt a unique zigzag belt structure with nitrogen atoms and functional groups located around both portals, yielding a large octagonal prism cavity. They are able to accommodate fullerene C60 or C70 with high affinity driven by lone&#8208;pair electron/&#960; interactions and steric complementarity between host and guest.

         <title>Access to Diverse Activatable Heptamethine Cyanine Probes with Low Intrinsic Fluorescence via 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig Cyclization Strategy for High&#8208;Contrast Bioimaging In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a general strategy for developing activatable heptamethine cyanine probes by regulating the exo&#8208;side&#8208;armed cyclization and ring&#8208;opening structures, thereby eliminating intrinsic background fluorescence and providing a substantial turn&#8208;on response (up to 184&#8208;fold). These novel probes are insensitive to physiological pH, polarity, and protein interaction, allowing them to precisely detect diverse biomarkers in vivo.








Abstract
The conversion of conventional &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; cyanine dyes into activatable NIR probes with low inherent fluorescence remains challenging, resulting in poor imaging contrast and nonspecific response in vivo. We herein report a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization strategy to create diverse activatable heptamethine cyanine probes with &#8220;zero&#8221; intrinsic background fluorescence for high&#8208;contrast bioimaging. This intramolecular ring&#8208;closure approach imparts a built&#8208;in switch to regulate the fluorescence of cyanine dyes, which predominantly exist in the nonfluorescent closed&#8208;loop form at pH over 5.0 and are not affected by environmental polarity and protein interaction, thereby reducing false&#8208;positive fluorescent signals. Upon reaction with various biomarkers, including methylglyoxal (MGO), hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), they could rapidly transform into fluorescent open&#8208;loop structures, showing significant NIR fluorescence enhancement (up to 184&#8208;fold). Furthermore, we extended this strategy to develop a variety of NIR&#8208;II ATP&#8208;activatable cyanine probes for the first time, as well as a theranostic probe 57 using host&#8211;guest chemistry. Probe 57 not only sensitively monitored ATP levels in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio of 48/1, but it also precisely detected extracellular ATP in stools. This work opens a new avenue to develop stimuli&#8208;responsive NIR cyanine probes for improving disease diagnosis.

         <title>High Voltage Design for Quasi&#8208;Solid Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ionic conductivity and pH of electrolyte are critical for the excellent performance of batteries. This is indeed observed as a hybrid acid&#8208;alkaline hybrid quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air battery (HSZAB) was designed with the successful synthesis of acid PVA/EGCG/Ag&#8208;PANa hydrogels, showing breaking voltage and enhance peak power density.








Abstract
Alkaline zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) are recognized as a promising candidate for next generation of safe battery systems, owing to their inherent advantages. However, the performance of traditional ZABs is constrained by a lower theoretical voltage of 1.65&#160;V, presenting a significant challenge in enhancing their practical application. This paper demonstrates a prototype of acid&#8208;alkaline hybrid quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air battery (HSZAB), featuring a unique design in both a new acidic gel electrolyte and battery structure. Our approach involves regulating the electrolyte pH and ionic conductivity to achieve an enhanced theoretical voltage, resulting in an open circuit voltage of up to 2.0&#160;V. Additionally, the HSZAB demonstrates substantially improved peak power density (417&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, five times higher than the conventional alkaline ZABs) and increased energy efficiency (from 60% to 82%). This finding underscores the promising prospects of high voltage zinc&#8208;air batteries, offering a substantial step forward in the field of energy storage systems.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Access to P&#8208;Chiral Triarylphosphine Oxides via Insertion of P&#9472;H Bonds into Diazonaphthoquinones</title>

Asymmetric insertion of P&#9472;H bond into carbene has been developed to access P&#8208;chiral phosphine oxides in excellent enantioselectivity.








Abstract
While significant progress has been made in the enantioselective insertion of carbenes into heteroatom&#8208;hydrogen bonds, this chemistry is restricted to the construction of carbon&#8208;based chirality. The asymmetric insertion of carbenes into P&#9472;H that delivers P&#8208;chiral products remains untouched. Rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of P&#8208;chiral triarylphosphine oxides via asymmetric C&#9472;P coupling of a secondary phosphine oxide (SPO) with diazonaphthoquinone is herein reported. Driven by aromatization, this protocol affords a variety of P&#8208;chiral triarylphosphine oxides tethered to a 2&#8208;naphthol functionality in excellent enantioselectivity by following a kinetic resolution reaction pattern. The diverse synthetic and catalytic applications of the P&#8208;chiral products highlight the value of this method, even though the derivatized trivalent chiral phosphine bears a rather low barrier of racemization.

Driven by aromatization, this protocol affords a variety of P-chiral triarylphosphine oxides tethered to a 2-naphthol functionality in excellent enantioselectivity by following a kinetic resolution reaction pattern. The diverse synthetic and catalytic applications of the P-chiral products highlight the value of this method, even though the derivatized trivalent chiral phosphine bears a rather low barrier of racemization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simple and Rapid Tumor EV Enrichment Enabled by Long DNA Probe&#8208;Guided Entanglement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective isolation of extracellular vesicle (EV) subpopulations is essential for their biomedical applications. We present a simple, rapid, and versatile strategy termed LODGE (Long DNA Probe&#8208;Guided EV Entanglement) for the enrichment of tumor&#8208;derived EVs (tEVs) from biofluids. LODGE facilitates the application of tEVs in biomarker discovery, therapeutic agents, and disease diagnosis, as evidenced by proteomic profiling, bioactivity assays, and cancer classification.








Abstract
Specific subpopulations of extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold significant clinical potential for biomarker discovery, disease diagnosis, and therapeutic agents. However, this field remains underutilized due to the lack of straightforward and versatile techniques for isolating EV subpopulations from biofluids. Here, we present LODGE, a long DNA probe&#8208;guided EV entanglement strategy for the simple, rapid, and selective enrichment of tumor&#8208;derived EVs (tEVs) from clinical specimens. LODGE uses two long DNA affinity probes to recognize specific subpopulations, causing them to aggregate with the assistance of splint strands, thereby achieving nondestructive, high&#8208;yield, and high&#8208;purity separation of tEVs within a short period. Proteomic analysis revealed that the isolated tEVs contributed to the identification of tumor&#8208;associated biomarkers compared to total EVs. Additionally, by incorporating a split G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;containing molecular trap domain, a novel structure that significantly improves the fluorescence emission of thioflavin T (ThT), into DNA affinity probes, we developed an innovative LODGE&#8208;ThT sensing strategy for the highly sensitive profiling of multiple tEV subpopulations. Using data from the tEVs alongside clinical indicators processed with machine learning algorithms, we effectively classified five tumor types. Our results show that LODGE is a promising tool for identifying specific EV subpopulations, and fostering their biomedical applications.

         <title>All Iron&#8208;Group and Platinum&#8208;Group Elements Metal High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles containing nine late transition elements adjacent on the periodic table (Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, and Pt) are synthesized using a simple, low&#8208;temperature wet chemical method. Compared to nanoparticles containing only precious platinum&#8208;group metals, adding the cheap and earth&#8208;abundant iron&#8208;group metals into the alloy results in superior activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEA) are promising catalyst materials for important energy transformations. So far, the focus has been on platinum&#8208;group metals, which possess excellent catalytic performance and similar properties, thus being easy to synthesize. However, incorporating more abundant and cheaper elements is preferable for large&#8208;scale applications and is fundamentally more interesting, as elements with different properties are expected to greatly affect the structural and electronic characteristics of the resulting alloy. Unfortunately, significant differences in elemental properties greatly complicate the synthesis and require extreme reaction conditions. In this work, we demonstrate the first synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles containing the nine neighboring elements used most often in heterogeneous catalysis: all the iron&#8208;group metals (Fe, Co, and Ni) and all the platinum&#8208;group metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, and Pt) through a simple low&#8208;temperature solution process. Remarkably, alloying the iron&#8208;group base metals with the platinum&#8208;group metals results in 30% increase in the catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under acidic conditions (TOF@25&#160;mV&#160;=&#160;1.58 s&#8722;1) compared to the equivalent alloy containing only platinum&#8208;group metals conditions (TOF@25&#160;mV&#160;=&#160;1.2 s&#8722;1). This activity is three times that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst (TOF@25&#160;mV&#160;=&#160;0.58 s&#8722;1), demonstrating simultaneous reduction in precious metal content and performance enhancement of electrocatalysts.

         <title>A Shelf&#8208;Stable Reagent for Photocatalytic Radical Pentafluorosulfanylation of Styrene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the development of the first family of shelf&#8208;stable imine&#8208;SF&#8325; reagents. These stable SF&#8325; reagents exhibit promising reactivity under visible&#8208;light activation, either via energy transfer catalysis or single electron transfer catalysis. This new class of reagents enables efficient SF&#8325; radical transfer. Mechanistic studies provided valuable insights into the underlying reaction pathways.








Abstract
We have developed the first family of air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable pentafluorosulfanylation (SF&#8325;) reagents. Although the SF&#8325; group is a bioisostere of the trifluoromethyl group (CF&#8323;)&#8212;exhibiting even greater electronegativity and lipophilicity, attributes that have earned it the nickname &#8220;super trifluoromethyl group&#8221;&#8212;the development of shelf&#8208;stable, non&#8208;toxic, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle SF&#8325;&#8208;incorporating reagents had remained elusive for over 70 years since its discovery. Our discovery enables the synthesis of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)&#8208;free fluorinated compounds, offering significant advantages over traditional CF&#8323; analogs. These new reagents exhibit promising reactivity under photochemical conditions, efficiently facilitating the formation of novel SF&#8325;&#8208;containing molecules. Moreover, our approach is compatible with the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules. Mechanistic studies have provided valuable insights into the underlying reaction pathways.

         <title>Systematic Evaluation of Polarizing Agents for Dynamic Nuclear Polarization Enhanced NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thirty&#8208;two polarizing agents consisting of dinitroxide and hetero biradicals are compared at magnetic fields of 9.4 T, 14.1 T, and 21.1 T, in organic and aqueous solvents. Their detailed enhancement factors, polarization build&#8208;up times, contribution factors, and the resultant overall sensitivity gains are measured. Hetero biradicals yields excellent performance across all fields measured here, guiding new design perspectives for future PA development.








Abstract
Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can significantly enhance the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, via the transfer of polarization from unpaired electrons to nuclei. As a result, there is considerable interest in improving DNP efficiency, particularly through the development of new polarizing agents (PAs). Here, a series of 32 PAs, including 26 dinitroxide and 6 hetero biradicals, of which 11 are introduced for the first time, were evaluated for their performance in DNP NMR experiments at magnetic field strengths of 9.4 T, 14.1 T, and 21.1 T. The PAs that are soluble in aqueous media were compared for different proton concentrations. A detailed comparison of the enhancement factors, polarization build&#8208;up times, contribution factors, and the resulting overall sensitivity factors is provided. We find that the class of narrow&#8208;line&#8208;broad&#8208;line biradicals not only yield the best performance at high field (21.1 T and 14.1 T) but remain among the best at intermediate fields (9.4 T). Specifically, SNAPol&#8208;1 and HyTEK2 are consistently among the best performing radicals at any field. Among the dinitroxides, notably at 9.4 T, the AsymPol&#8208;POK and M&#8208;TinyPol families stand out in proton&#8208;dense aqueous matrices, and a newly developed dinitroxide, NaphPolCbo, is found to provide the best overall sensitivity factor in organic solvent.

         <title>Enhancing the Built&#8208;In Electric Field of Thickness&#8208;Insensitive Small Molecule Cathode Interlayers for High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>

Three donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type imidazole&#8208;functionalized triads with progressively enhanced built&#8208;in electric fields (BEFs) are proposed and used as cathode interlayer materials in organic solar cells (OSCs). The advantages of enhancing BEF in regulating the optoelectronic properties and interfacial modification capabilities of the triads are elucidated, leading to a significant improvement in device efficiency (20.10%) and enhanced device stability.








Abstract
The built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) is proposed as a critical design parameter for optimizing small&#8208;molecule cathode interlayer materials (SM&#8208;CIMs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). By strategically transforming imidazole&#8208;functionalized triads from a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D)&#160;to an A&#8208;D&#8208;A configuration and replacing the A unit with a more electron&#8208;deficient moiety, we developed three triads: (TBT)2NDI, (NDI)2TBT, and (PDI)2TBT, each exhibiting progressively enhanced BEF, along with improved conductivity, work function (WF) adjustability, energy level alignment, and crystallinity. Additionally, the A&#8208;D&#8208;A triads facilitate superior electronic communication with both non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) and polymer donors, enhancing photoexcitation utilization and reducing triplet state formation. Consequently, transitioning from (TBT)2NDI to (NDI)2TBT and then to (PDI)2TBT significantly boosts OSC efficiency and operational stability. Notably, devices with (PDI)2TBT and (NDI)2TBT retain 85.0% and 82.3% of their peak efficiencies, respectively, far exceeding the (TBT)2NDI&#8208;based device (65.9%) at an interlayer thickness of approximately 105&#160;nm. Furthermore, (PDI)2TBT exhibits excellent compatibility with various active layers, and an outstanding performance of 20.10% is recorded in the PM6:L8&#8208;BO:BTP&#8208;eC9 system. This comprehensive study, encompassing molecular design, theoretical simulation, device fabrication, and fundamental device physics, highlights the importance of strategic donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) electronic framework modifications to enhance BEF, thereby advancing the development of sophisticated SM&#8208;CIMs for OSCs.

         <title>ortho&#8208;C&#9472;H Alkylation of Aryl Chlorides by a Catellani Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Difunctionalization of less reactive aryl chlorides by cooperation of a norbornene (NBE) mediator with a palladium catalyst bearing an electron&#8208;rich phosphine ligand delivered ortho&#8208;C&#9472;H alkylation/ipso&#8208;olefination products. The protocol also enabled sequential Catellani reactions to increase molecular complexity. DFT calculations revealed that C&#9472;H&#8943;O interactions between the XPhos ligand and the NBE mediator promote the pivotal NBE insertion step.








Abstract
Herein we report a general and practical palladium/norbornene catalysis system that effectively promotes difunctionalization of less reactive aryl chlorides. The key to success lies in the use of a particular norbornene (NBE) derivative as a powerful mediator that synergistically cooperates with the palladium catalyst and an electron&#8208;rich phosphine ligand. A broad spectrum of electronically diverse aryl chlorides (57 examples) delivered the corresponding ortho&#8208;C&#9472;H alkylation/ipso&#8208;olefination products in moderate to good yields. Notably, this protocol features excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, high concentration, scalability, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex aryl chlorides. Furthermore, by integrating this chemistry with its counterparts involving aryl iodides and bromides, an intriguing triple&#8208;Catellani reaction sequence was developed, rapidly increasing molecular complexity and diversity. Finally, DFT calculations were performed, revealing that noncovalent C&#9472;H&#8943;O interactions between the XPhos ligand and the NBE mediator promote the pivotal NBE insertion step.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering and Structural Modulation of RuO2&#8208;Based Catalysts for Highly Active and Durable Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 31, July 28, 2025. </description>

The cobalt oxide (Co3O4) synergized nickel&#8208;doped ruthenium oxide (Ni&#8208;RuO2) heterojunction was fabricated on a reduced graphene oxide surface (Co3O4/Ni&#8208;RuO2/rGO). The Co3O4/Ni&#8208;RuO2/rGO can achieve optimal OOH* adsorption and stabilize RuO2 for efficient and durable OER.








Abstract
Developing highly active and durable catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under acidic conditions is key to commercializing green hydrogen production via water splitting. Here, we fabricated a cobalt oxide (Co3O4)&#8208;synergized nickel&#8208;doped ruthenium oxide (Ni&#8208;RuO2) heterojunction on reduced graphene oxide (Co3O4/Ni&#8208;RuO2/rGO) as an efficient and durable OER electrocatalyst in acidic electrolytes. The interface of Co3O4/Ni&#8208;RuO2 heterojunction and doping of Ni into RuO2, as well as their effect on electronic structure, were examined by advanced characterizations. With only 1.36 wt% RuO2, the Co3O4/Ni&#8208;RuO2/rGO heterojunction revealed an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 195 and 305&#160;mV at 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Moreover, the catalyst's performance was well maintained after operating for 100&#160;h at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, suggesting great promise for practical applications. Density functional theory calculations and in situ Raman analysis indicate that both the heterojunction structure and Ni doping play crucial roles in enhancing the OER activity and durability. This study provides a promising avenue for developing cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts with superior activity and stability for advanced energy conversion.

         <title>In Situ Tracking of Ni&#8208;MOF Reconstruction into Active Ni(OH)2 OER Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a key bottleneck in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. In this work, we demonstrate the transmutation of a Ni&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF), composed of one&#8208;dimensional Ni&#8211;(&#956;3&#8208;OH)/(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)&#8211;Ni chains interconnected by 1,4&#8208;ndc linker, into catalytically active &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2. This top&#8208;down reconstruction strategy involves the disintegration of 1,4&#8208;ndc linker and transformation of 1D Ni&#8211;(&#956;3&#8208;OH)/(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)&#8211;Ni chains (which act as precursors), into ultra&#8208;low&#8208;dimensional (thickness ~ 1.5&#8208;2.6 nm), defect&#8208;rich &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 structure. The activated catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA.cm&#8208;2, surpassing commercial IrO2. In situ Raman and powder diffraction studies demonstrate pH&#8208; and potential&#8208;dependent phase transitions, leading to the formation of catalytically active &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirms progressive structural evolution, with a Ni&#8211;O bond contraction from 2.06 &#197; to 1.89 &#197; under catalytic conditions, indicative of dynamic NiOOH phase formation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the exposed Ni2+ centers stabilize OER intermediates and facilitate the adsorbed oxygen evolution mechanism (AEM). The catalyst also demonstrates robust activity at elevated temperatures. This work provides extensive mechanistic insights into catalyst activation and introduces a novel strategy for designing high&#8208;performance MOF based OER electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Recyclable Hybrid Polymer Networks using Whole Biomass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whole&#8208;plant biomass from non&#8208;agricultural sources and waste biomass from processing agricultural products are both promising feedstocks for biopolymer production because they are abundant and do not compete with food production. However, their processing steps are notoriously tedious with the final materials often displaying inferior performance and limited scope in their properties. Here, we report a strategy to integrate whole&#8208;cell spirulina, a green&#8208;blue algae, into robust hybrid algae&#8208;polyimine networks by leveraging a mechanochemical ball milling method. This strategy provides a greener synthetic approach to conventional solvent casting methods for polyimine synthesis; it simultaneously overcomes persistent constraints encountered in biomass processing and derivatization. The hybrid algae&#8208;based materials retain adaptability and recyclability imparted by their underlying dynamic covalent polymer matrix and display enhanced mechanical properties compared to their all&#8208;synthetic equivalents.&#160;These advantageous properties are attributed to the unique morphology of the ball milled hybrid materials which is facilitated by integration of the spirulina into the polymer matrix. Substituting spirulina with alternative biomass sources such as waste agricultural products also yields robust hybrid materials, thus highlighting the broad utility of this straightforward mechanochemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Co sites in n&#8208;n type heterojunction enable selective electrochemical co&#8208;valorization of HMF and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO are two highly investigated areas. Efficient electrocatalytic system design that combines CO2 valorization with biomass upgrading offers a viable solution to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and renewable energy at the same time. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial&#8208;engineered CoS/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C n&#8208;n type heterojunction featuring unique dual Co sites and strong built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) effects, which enables efficient electrochemical coupling of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The optimized catalyst achieves exceptional performance metrics, i.e., a record&#8208;low onset potential of 1.12 V (vs. RHE), with 99% selectivity and 98.2% faradaic efficiency (FE) for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in HMFOR, coupled with 98.6% CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity and the FE average was retained 98.4% in CO2RR, which outperform the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Moreover, the integrated HMFOR//CO2RR system demonstrates impressive stability over 50&#8208;hour continuous operation. Through systematic experimental examination and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the BEF boosts the formation of the unique dual Co coordination environments (Co&#8208;N4 electron&#8208;deficient and Co&#8208;S electron&#8208;rich configurations) through modulation of charge transport dynamics, facilitating HMF activation through *OH intermediate stabilization while promoting multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction via charge accumulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Co Coordination Mode in COF Nanosheets for Efficient Solar&#8208;driven Reduction of Non&#8208;neat CO2 into Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO2&#160;where&#160;CO2 enrichment and purification&#160;is an energy&#8208;intensive process. Herein, we report a Co&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF with asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO2. The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst Co17.7&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from neat CO2 and 180.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from 40 vol% CO2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 116.0 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits widely and continuously adjustable CO/H2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the COF by formation of atomic dispersed N&#8208;Co&#8208;O4 sites, enhances dissociation of water and CO2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for the photoreduction CO2 to syngas.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Metallic Binding Characteristics of the Intermetalloid f&#8208;/p&#8208;Block Cluster [(La@In2Bi11)2Bi2]6&#8211;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Main goals of contemporary research in chemistry are to create new materials with unique properties and to understand the chemical bonding in them, especially between metal atoms in larger structures. The isolation of a single lanthanide atom in a In/Bi cage offers a non&#8208;standard bonding situation, which deserves thorough exploration. In this study, the bonding behavior of La, In, and Bi atoms in the ternary cluster [(La@In2Bi11)2Bi2]6&#8722; and the complex [La(C5Me4H)3] used for its synthesis are characterized and compared by applying high energy resolution X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and computations. A clearly detectable covalent La(5d)&#8211;Bi(6p) interaction, induced in a highly electron&#8208;rich environment, is illustrated. The electronic structure of the La atom can be described as having the character of an ion being trapped and bonded in a heterometallic Bi/In cage. The advanced X&#8208;ray spectroscopic experimental tools applied here enable comparative studies of binding properties, focusing on different metals within the intermetalloid cluster. These tools can be employed iteratively to support the development of synthetic strategies that aim at tuning bond characteristics at the boundary of covalent and metallic bonding, thereby advancing the chemical and physical properties of novel multinary cluster compounds. The results were corroborated by GW and Bethe&#8208;Salpeter&#8208;equation (GW&#8208;BSE) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Ag atoms induce Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on WO3 for ultrastable acid ammonia synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on one&#8208;dimensional WO3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeds ~90% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.6 ~ &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a maximum FE of approaching 100% at &#8722;0.4 VRHE and a maximum NH3 yield reaching 5.24 &#177; 0.41 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.55 VRHE. The catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ~94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly, we succeeded in obtaining a NH3 production rate of 104.08 mmol h&#8208;1 at &#8722;3.5 V, and maintained the stability toward NO3RR for over 30 h with FE &gt; 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate&#160;that the formation of Ag&#8208;N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8594;*NHO, considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities.</dc:description>

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nano Ir&#8208;Based Alloy Clusters&#160;by Hierarchical Confinement Effect for Water Splitting</title>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of sub&#8208;nanoscale noble metal catalysts is pivotal for&#160;enhancing electrocatalytic performance, yet achieving precise control over particle size at this scale remains a critical challenge.&#160;In this work, we propose a hierarchical confinement strategy&#160;which combines spatial confinement at nanoscale and anchoring confinement at atomic scale, to overcome the size limitations imposed by high&#8208;temperature sintering.&#160;Using this strategy, a series of uniformly sized (~1 nm) Ir&#8208;based alloy clusters,&#160;including IrMn, IrFe, IrCo, and IrNi, are successfully fabricated. The synthesized sub&#8208;nanoscale&#160;IrCo alloy clusters&#160;(denoted as sub&#8208;IrCo cluster)&#160;demonstrate exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance, with an ultralow overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA/cm&#178; and a remarkable mass activity 87.5&#160;times greater than that of commercial IrO2. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that the incorporation of N enhances the interaction between&#160;Ir atoms and the support,&#160;which inhibits particle agglomeration. This&#160;work provides an&#160;effective strategy for&#160;preventing&#160;particle sintering via a hierarchical confinement effect and achieves&#160;precise size control&#160;at sub&#8208;nanoscale,&#160;opening&#160;a new avenue for the development&#160;of efficient noble metal catalysts with high atomic utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Bipyridine&#8211;Thiosumanene Isomeric Lewis Bases for Synergistic Defect Passivation and Hole Extraction Enables over 26% Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interface defects between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL) seriously limit the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed two isomers, 4BT and 5BT, based on 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;thiosumanene&#8208;functionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as novel Lewis bases with dual capabilities for deep&#8208;level defects (Pb2+, VI) passivation and promoting hole extraction. By shifting the pyridine bridging unit from the tetra to the penta positions, these molecules undergo a configurational transformation from an orthogonal (4BT) to a planar structure (5BT). The configuration&#8208;functionality relationship was comprehensively investigated through theorical and experimental analyses. The planar configuration of 5BT&#160;enables more Lewis base sites to interact with perovskite, exhibiting more pronounced deep&#8208;level defect passivation effect, while improving hole extraction capability. Consequently, the 5BT&#8208;modified n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs achieved a champion PCE of 26.15% (certified at 26.12%) and superior operational stability by retaining 94.0% of the initial PCE according to ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol. This work offers a unique molecular designing mechanism to address the interfacial&#8208;related issues for high&#8208;performance PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Metastable Macrocyclic Bis&#8208;Meisenheimer Adduct</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electron&#8208;deficient tetranitroazacalixarene is shown to undergo reversible cyanide capture via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, yielding an unprecedented class of metastable dianionic macrocycle incorporating two Meisenheimer units, fully characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR, and electronic absorption spectroscopies. Acting as a chemical fuel, cyanide transiently drives the formation of this adduct, which can spontaneously regenerate the parent macrocycle under mild conditions, representing a rare demonstration of metastability in a Meisenheimer complex. The dynamic behavior of this system, reminiscent of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium assemblies, is finely tunable through macrocycle concentration, counterion nature, solvent, and temperature. Detailed crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational analyses reveal that intramolecular hydrogen bonding plays a key role in stabilizing the adduct. Comparative studies with simpler analogues further highlight the importance of macrocyclic preorganization and non&#8208;covalent interactions in governing this reversible reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Assisted Confined Synthesis of Metal Nanoparticles in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Enzyme&#8208;Metal Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of enzymatic and metal catalysis in cascade reactions offers a highly efficient approach for producing high&#8208;value chemicals, such as chiral pharmaceuticals. However, overcoming the inherent incompatibility between metal and enzyme catalysts and optimizing their stability and activity to achieve effective synergy, remains a significant challenge. Here, we present an enzyme&#8208;assisted, confined synthesis of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) within the nanochannels of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), to construct efficient enzyme&#8208;metal hybrid catalysts for cascade reactions.&#160;The COF nanochannels stabilize the enzyme during MNP formation and the catalytic process, and synergize with the enzyme to regulate the size, dispersion, and electronic state of the MNPs through surface amino acid residues, realizing the co&#8208;encapsulation and dual&#8208;optimization of both components.&#160;Using Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) and Pd nanoparticles as a model system, Pd/CALB@COF exhibits an 8.2&#8208;fold higher yield in the kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic 1&#8208;phenylethylamine (1&#8208;PEA), and a 2.7&#8208;fold enhancement in racemization&#160;conversion,&#160;compared to counterparts without COF. Their synergy in dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) delivers&#160;~91% yield, &gt;98% enantiomeric excess (e.e.) value, and recyclability, with applicability to various chiral amines. This strategy has been validated across different metal&#8208;enzyme systems, establishing a versatile platform for designing efficient enzyme&#8208;metal cascade systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of CDK12/13 and BRD4 Molecular Glue Degraders</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted protein degradation (TPD) is an emerging therapeutic approach for the selective elimination of disease&#8208;related proteins. While molecular glue degraders exhibit drug&#8208;like properties, their discovery has traditionally been serendipitous and often requires post&#8208;hoc rationalization. In this study, we demonstrate the rational, mechanism&#8208;guided design of molecular glue degraders using gluing moieties. Building on established principles, by appending a chemical gluing moiety to several small molecule inhibitors, we successfully transformed them into degraders, obviating the need for a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase recruiter. Specifically, we found that incorporating a hydrophobic aromatic ring or a double bond into a cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase 12 and 13 (CDK12/13) dual inhibitor enabled the recruitment of DNA damage&#8208;binding protein 1 (DDB1), thereby transforming a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight bivalent CDK12 degrader into a potent monovalent CDK12/13 molecular glue degrader. We also showcase that attaching a cysteine&#8208;reactive warhead to a bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor converts it into a degrader by recruiting the DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 16 (DCAF16) E3 ligase.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer of Ag(II) CF2X Carboxylates: Quantum Yield and Electrophotocatalytic Arene Fluoroalkylation Tuned by X</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporation of CF2X groups beyond CF3 into arene scaffolds is underdeveloped despite these groups&#8217; utility as halogen&#8208;bond donors and as precursors to bioisosteres. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization, and comparative photochemistry of a suite of [Ag(II)(bpy)2O2CCF2X]+ and Ag(II)(bpy)(O2CCF2X)2 (bpy = 2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine, X = F, CF3, Cl, Br, H, CH3) carboxylate complexes. We find a dramatic effect of the X substituent on the efficiency of generating CF2X radicals by ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT), with Ag(II) photoreduction rates varying by over an order of magnitude and quantum yields spanning over 20%. We provide insight into how electronic and structural perturbations of the Ag(II)&#8211;O2CCF2X core are manifested in the LMCT quantum efficiency. With this information in hand, Ag(II)&#8208;mediated electrophotocatalytic CF2X functionalization is carried out on a range of (hetero)arenes. This work expands the nascent field of Ag(II)&#8208;based photocatalysis by allowing for (hetero)aryl&#8211;CF2X functionalization directly from unactivated fluoroalkyl carboxylate precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Scale Interfacial Water Management Switching Reaction Pathway of Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) involves numerous intermediates and simultaneous interactions between these intermediates and water (H2O) molecules. Although extensive research has focused on stabilizing the carbon&#8208;related intermediates, limited attention has been paid to investigating the local regulations of H2O molecules at molecular level. Considering the electrocatalytic interface, H2O is critical during CO2RR process, as H2O molecules are directly involved in CO2 reduction process or indirectly modify the solid&#8208;liquid interfacial structure, thereby impacting the reaction process. In this study, we use a model copper&#8208;based catalyst, containing palladium and indium dopants that have different hydrogen and oxygen adsorption capabilities, to investigate the influence of H2O molecules on CO2 electroreduction selectivity. We find, by enhancing the participation of isolated H2O molecules, instead of asymmetric H&#8208;bonded H2O or ice&#8208;like H2O, in the local electrocatalytic microenvironment during CO2 reduction process, that the cathodic products remarkably change from 95% C1 FE to 70% C2 FE. We unveil, via in&#8208;situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurement, that the H2O microenvironment regulation can promote the formation of key intermediates, thus tuning the CO2 reduction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>PCR&#8208;Free Site&#8208;Directed Mutagenesis on Repetitive Sequences Using Single&#8208;Stranded DNA&#8208;Assisted Double&#8208;Stranded DNA Nicking by DNAzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis (SDM) is a key driver for many biochemical investigations and biotechnological applications. Despite decades of development, it is still difficult to perform SDM on some sequences, including highly repetitive ones, because polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is often used as the most effective method for SDM, but results in complicated products with these sequences. To overcome this limitation, we report herein a PCR&#8208;free SDM method that uses DNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes. Since these DNAzymes lack the capability of cleaving double&#8208;stranded DNA, we employed single&#8208;stranded DNAs as assisting DNAs to open superhelical plasmids, allowing the DNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes to cleave the plasmid. Such a system, named single&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;assisted double&#8208;stranded DNA nicking by DNAzymes (DANDA), expanded the substrate scope of DNAzymes to double&#8208;stranded, superhelical plasmids. We showed that DANDA is highly customizable and target&#8208;specific, which allows successful generation of mutations on a plasmid containing PCR&#8208;incompatible repetitive sequences. By using solely unmodified DNA oligos that are more cost&#8208;effective and easier to prepare than other systems that employ either PNA or restriction enzymes, this DANDA system further expands the applications of DNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes in synthetic biology for different biochemical and biotechnological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Photocatalyzed Radical Anellation of Nitroalkanes with Alkenes or Alkynes for the Synthesis of Isoxazolines and Isoxazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The visible light&#8208;mediated copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;step synthesis of isoxazolines and isoxazoles from readily available ethyl nitroacetate or phenyl nitromethane is reported.

Key intermediates for this formal [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition are &#945;&#8208;nitro radicals generated via photoinduced single electron oxidation of nitronates, contrasting the generation of such radicals via Cu(I)&#8208;photocatalysis by a reductive pathway, which shows a different reaction pattern in the coupling with alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>SmI2&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Alkyl Housane Ketones and Alkenes in an Approach to Norbornanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;coupling strategies involving strain&#8208;release have gained significant recent attention for the construction of complex molecular frameworks, particularly in the context of preparing bioisosteres for medicinal chemistry. While the reactivity of cyclopropanes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been extensively studied, higher homologues are emerging as valuable substrates for synthesis. For example, methods for the fragmentation and coupling of bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane, or housane, ketones show promise, but are currently limited in substrate scope. Here, we describe a mild, atom&#8208;economical, samarium diiodide (SmI2) catalyzed fragmentation and coupling of alkyl and aryl housane ketones with alkenes that grants access to functionalized norbornane structural motifs, not easily accessible by classical cycloaddition approaches, and with considerable potential for further manipulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioelectrosynthesis of Signaling Molecules for Selective Modulation of Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioelectrosynthesis holds great potential for studying and regulating biological systems through the in situ synthesis and delivery of cell signaling molecules with high spatiotemporal precision. Despite recent advancements, precise control over multiple signaling molecules within a single platform remains challenging. Here, we introduce a bioelectrosynthesis approach capable of selectively producing two types of signaling molecules from a single precursor. This system leverages multi&#8208;metal sulfide electrocatalysts inspired by denitrifying enzymes, which generate signaling molecules, nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3), from nitrite ions. By controlling catalytic active sites, NO or NH3 can be selectively produced under mild electric fields in physiologically relevant conditions. In situ product analyses and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that NO intermediate binding affinity determines product selectivity. These electrocatalysts integrate seamlessly with biological systems, allowing precise, on&#8208;demand modulation of NO&#8208; or NH3&#8208;mediated signaling pathways in human cell lines. By combining electrochemical precision with selective cell control, this strategy may advance the study and regulation of biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrosilylation of Alkyl gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes to Construct Carbon and Silicon Stereogenic Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of aliphatic alkenes without auxiliary or stabilizing groups presents a significant challenge in modern organic synthesis. We report herein the nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of alkyl&#8208;substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, which enables the generation of chiral &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylsilanes with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Moreover, the simultaneous construction of carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers was achieved with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity using prochiral silanes. This method provides an efficient approach to access sp3&#8208;enriched C&#8208;stereogenic centers equipped with high&#8208;value difluoromethyl groups. The resulting enantioenriched silanes could undergo a range of stereospecific transformations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the detailed mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Platform for Enhanced Drug Delivery to Glioblastoma using Targeted Multidomain Protein Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;based nanocarriers bear highly desirable properties such as biodegradability and ability to facilitate passage through biological barriers such as the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier. Using modular protein engineering, we develop a strategy for iteratively improving the delivery efficacy of hydrophobic small molecules for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). By increasing the multiplicity m of the coiled&#8208;coil and RGD peptide targeting regions from 1 to 2, we can increase both the hydrodynamic micellar size and drug loading capacity of targeted multidomain protein assembly (TMPA) relative to its predecessor thermoresponsive assembled protein (TRAP). An upper limit of m is likely determined by steric interactions. TMPA shows a 1.7&#8208;fold increased encapsulation of doxorubicin (Dox) compared to TRAP and demonstrates improved uptake by U87 human GBM cells. Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dye&#8208;labelled TMPA (NIR&#8208;TMPA) is injected into mice orthotopically implanted with GBM cells and fit to a 2&#8208;compartment pharmacokinetic model. NIR&#8208;TMPA demonstrates prolonged short&#8208;phase half&#8208;life in tumor&#8208;bearing mice compared to control with similar slow&#8208;phase half&#8208;life, leading to an increased area&#8208;under&#8208;the&#8208;curve clearance and pointing to its sequestration in the tumor site. Endpoint fluorescence analysis of mouse organs ex vivo also supports this conclusion. TMPA and its future derivatives therefore bear potential for targeted treatment of GBM.</dc:description>

         <title>Pt Colloidosomes with Broadband Absorption for Near&#8208;Infrared Light Photocatalysis through d&#8208;Band Hot&#8208;Carriers Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interband and intraband electronic excitations in transition metals as nanocatalysts are crucial for the generation of hot carriers. Unlike the well&#8208;known Au, Ag and Cu nanoparticles (NPs), in which hot carriers are directly formed by absorption of visible light, Pt NPs still have limited hot carriers photogeneration ability. Nonetheless, Pt's unique d&#8208;band structure permits a high density of electronic states near Fermi energy. It should have exhibited photoenhanced catalysis. Here, guided by Finite&#8208;Different&#8208;Time&#8208;Domain (FDTD) calculations, we take advantage of Pt electronic structure by designing a sub&#8208;100 nm colloidosome (Cs) consisted of ultrasmall (&#8804; 5 nm) Pt NPs with broadband absorption from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) band. The ultrasmall Pt NPs in the Cs efficiently generated hot electrons even under excitation with the low&#8208;energy electromagnetic radiation. The key for realization of Cs is the exploitation of laser&#8208;generated, grain boundaries (GBs) enriched Mn3O4 NPs as scaffolds for the efficient and homogeneous loading of ultrasmall Pt NPs. These Pt Cs show outstanding performances as catalase (CAT) and oxidase (OXD) mimics under NIR band irradiation, allowing their use for photocatalysis of oxidation reactions. Besides, the in vivo exploitation of Pt Cs for tumor photodynamic therapy allowed unprecedented efficacy and caused tumor growth suppression.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;infrared Light Catalysis of Carbon Dioxide Reduction by Conjugated Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current CO2 photocatalytic systems mainly work in ultraviolet and visible light regions, and the inability to utilize the abundant near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiation or the low utilization rate is still a bottleneck for practical applications. We address this challenge through the strategic synthesis of metal&#8208;free conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs), PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM, to enhance the NIR absorption capabilities, achieving a CO production rate of ~74.7 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in gas&#8208;solid phase CO2 reduction, surpassing typical NIR&#8208;responsive catalysts. Meanwhile, PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM can obtain a CO production rate of 344.1 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in full&#8208;spectrum irradiated CO2 reduction. Infrared thermography reveals that the non&#8208;radiative attenuation of PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM led to high photothermal temperature under NIR irradiation, which accounts for its reduction performance. Mechanistic studies combining fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy and in situ infrared characterization elucidate the photocatalytic pathway and intermediate formation. This result indicates that PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM can be a promising metal&#8208;free catalyst for practical solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Predicting A&#8208;Element Substitution and MXene Formation in Reactions Between MAX Phases and Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective etching has emerged as a key method for synthesizing 2D materials, with the conversion of MAX phases to MXenes being by far the most widely studied and reported example. While traditional methods rely on etching in primarily acidic aqueous media, molten salts offer an intriguing alternative. However, the current understanding of MAX phase reactivity in molten salts is limited, restricting our ability to predict reaction outcomes. In this study, we present a computational framework that uses process&#8208;specific phase diagrams to model A&#8208;element substitution and MXene formation, as well as competing side reactions. Applying this approach to Ti3AlC2, V2AlC and Ti2AlN in ZnCl2 molten salt we reveal distinct reaction behaviors despite identical redox potentials of key processes. Our findings underscore the limitations of predicting reactions based solely on redox potentials and show that our model can capture key trends in MXene synthesis. Beyond MXenes, our methodology lays the groundwork for identifying new 2D materials accessible through molten salt etching.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Inositol Pyrophosphate Toolbox: Stereoselective Synthesis and Application of PP&#8208;InsP4 Isomers in Plant Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inositol pyrophosphates (PP&#8208;InsPs) are highly phosphorylated signaling molecules that regulate diverse cellular processes, including phosphate homeostasis and energy metabolism across species. Despite extensive research on well&#8208;characterized exhaustively phosphorylated PP&#8208;InsPs, such as 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP5 (5&#8208;InsP7) and 1,5&#8208;(PP)2&#8208;InsP4 (1,5&#8208;InsP8), the functional relevance of less abundant not fully phosphorylated isomers, remains largely unknown. In this study, we synthesized all unsymmetric 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP4 isomers in enantiopure form and assigned their structures using 31P&#8208;NMR analysis in combination with a chiral solvating agent. Additionally, we developed 18O&#8208;labeled PP&#8208;InsP4 standards for mass spectrometry in combination with capillary electrophoresis (CE&#8208;MS), enabling the assignment of PP&#8208;InsP4 in Arabidopsis thaliana under phosphate starvation. Our findings show that the previously detected, phosphate starvation&#8208;induced root&#8208;specific PP&#8208;InsP4 isomer does not match any 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP4 isomer, contrary to previous suggestions, thus indicating an alternative phosphorylation pattern. Enzyme assays further demonstrate that Arabidopsis ITPK1 selectively phosphorylates [6&#8208;OH]&#8208;InsP5 and [3&#8208;OH]&#8208;InsP5 at the 5&#8208;position, while other InsP5 isomers remain unchanged. This suggests that an unidentified enzymatic activity is involved in the formation of the elusive root PP&#8208;InsP4 species. Our study provides a comprehensive framework for the synthesis, analysis, and functional investigation of PP&#8208;InsP4, providing an entry point for future studies on their biochemical activity and their physiological roles.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Crystalline&#160;2D&#160;Conjugated&#160;Metal&#8211;Organic&#160;Framework&#160;for Superior Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as promising electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, developing 2D c&#8208;MOFs with multiple redox&#8208;active sites and well&#8208;defined structures to enhance the performance of SIBs and elucidate the structure&#8211;property relationship remains challenging. Herein, a 2D c&#8208;MOF single crystal (Cu&#8208;TBP) with dual active centers was synthesized using an octahydroxyl tetrabenzophenazine (8OH&#8208;TBP) ligand. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) analysis reveals the atomic&#8208;level crystal structure of Cu&#8208;TBP, characterized by a planar 2D rhombus network and a unique slipped AA layer&#8208;stacking. Cu&#8208;TBP exhibits typical semiconducting behavior with a high electrical conductivity (7.69 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S m&#8722;1 at 298 K) and a low thermal activation energy. Owing to its abundant redox&#8208;active sites and superb electrical conductivity, Cu&#8208;TBP shows remarkable electrochemical performance as a SIB anode, achieving a high reversible capacity of 369.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.25 A g&#8722;1, exceptional rate capability, and extraordinary cyclability (82.6% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 0.25 A g&#8722;1).

         <title>Porous Organic Cages as Building Blocks for Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Confined nanospaces play a fundamental role in nature, inspiring synthetic analogues that emulate biological precision and efficiency. Among these, porous crystalline materials such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), and molecular cage compounds have emerged as powerful platforms for catalysis, separation, and energy storage. Recent developments highlight the potential of porous organic cages (POCs) as modular building blocks for the construction of advanced materials. In this Minireview, their integration into extended frameworks, such as Cage&#8208;COFs and Cage&#8208;MOFs, is described, as they allow precise control over porosity and enhance chemical robustness. These hybrids merge the structural regularity of COFs with the discrete functionality of cages, enabling the design of lightweight, hierarchically organised materials. In addition, polymer&#8208;containing Cage&#8208;POPs and supramolecular frameworks are discussed. Collectively, these developments position POCs as versatile synthons for next&#8208;generation porous materials, unlocking pathways toward functional, adaptive, and recyclable architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Unsaturated Phosphine Oxides for Modular Antibody Rebridging and Single Reagent Peptide&#8208;Cyclisation&#8208;Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving modular, selective and homogeneous protein modifications is of utmost importance for the design of next generation biopharmaceuticals; especially in the context of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs). Here, we introduce unsaturated phosphine oxides as versatile triple&#8208;reactive reagents, allowing orthogonal chemoselective bioconjugation schemes. Starting from triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide, a variety of functionalized diethynyl&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides (DTPOs) could be accessed by using CuI&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). We showcase DTPO&#8208;reagents in the fast and selective generation of various highly stable antibody&#8208;conjugates via antibody disulfide rebridging. A highlight from this methodology is the synthesis of a DAR 4 ADC following a modular 2&#8208;step strategy using bioorthogonal tetrazine&#8208;labeling with bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne (BCN) or trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) containing payloads. Notably, the DTPO&#8208;rebridged ADC exhibited potent cytotoxicity against Her2+ cancer cells. Moreover, we utilize triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide to obtain ethynyl&#8208;ditriazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides (EDPOs) which enable a unique, single&#8208;reagent peptide&#8208;cyclization&#8208;bioconjugation protocol resulting in functional cyclic peptide&#8208;protein conjugates. Overall, our work provides versatile and powerful chemoselective modalities for the controlled modification of antibodies, peptide&#8208;cyclization and peptide&#8208;protein conjugation, expanding the toolkit for chemical biology and therapeutic development.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Protein Profiling Using Nanopores and Dimeric Aptamer&#8208;Modified DNA Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule protein profiling offers unparalleled sensitivity for detecting rare biomarkers, with significant potential for early disease diagnosis and monitoring. Nanopore sensors enable the detection of proteins in solution and are well&#8208;suited for clinical applications due to their high sensitivity and throughput. Here, we introduce a nanopore&#8208;based detection strategy utilising an aptamer&#8208;protein&#8208;aptamer sandwich structure to enhance protein detection further. The aptamer probe is extended with a double&#8208;stranded DNA carrier to enhance protein transport and detection efficiency. Upon protein binding, dimerization of the DNA carriers occurs, allowing charge&#8208;based classification of bound versus unbound states. Additionally, the sandwich complex produces a characteristic subpeak within individual nanopore events, with subpeak height correlating to protein size. This approach enables selective detection of dimeric proteins, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF), with sub&#8208;picomolar detection limits. In principle, it can be adapted for any protein with two distinct aptamer&#8208;binding sites, as demonstrated with thrombin. This method also facilitates real&#8208;time monitoring of ligand&#8208;induced receptor dimerization in complex biological fluids, offering a powerful tool for potential single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>From Triplet to Twist: The Photochemical E/Z&#8208;Isomerization Pathway of the Near&#8208;Infrared Photoswitch peri&#8208;Anthracenethioindigo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, significant progress has been made in the effort to shift the absorption of photoresponsive molecules into the long&#8208;wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum. A breakthrough in this field was the recent development of &#960;&#8208;extended indigoid photoswitches, i.e., peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT), exhibiting all&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared absorption. The excited&#8208;state isomerization mechanisms of this very new addition to the realm of photoswitching are currently not understood at all, prohibiting a rational further development. In this study, we present a combined theoretical and experimental approach, including (TD&#8208;)DFT and ADC(2) calculations as well as steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved femtosecond spectroscopy, to explore the isomerization pathways of this photoswitch. Our findings show that E&#8208;to&#8208;Z photoisomerization on singlet potential energy surfaces (PESs) is highly unfavorable and instead shows that photoswitching proceeds on the T&#8321; PES. These insights enhance our understanding of thioindigoid photochemistry and demonstrate that extension of the &#960;&#8208;system and peri&#8208;connectivity in the heterocycle unlock extremely favorable photoswitching properties along with the desirable red&#8208;shift in absorption. Reliable photoswitching from the triplet is achieved because of its favorable energy, which evades undesirable interference from oxygen quenching. These results pave the way for advancing thioindigoid&#8208;based photoswitches to improved performance and functionality in a rational way.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Switchable Poly&#8208;Lewis Acids Allow the Controlled Release of Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Presently, there is a notable interest in poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLAs), their host&#8208;guest chemistry and their application in catalytic processes. The present study combines PLAs with redox&#8208;active dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctatetraene (dbCOT) units. dbCOT&#8208;based PLAs can be planarised by a two&#8208;electron reduction. The molecular structures of the reduced PLAs, studied by sc&#8208;XRD experiments and DFT calculations, show the formation of extended &#960;&#8208;systems. This &#960;&#8208;system extends to the Lewis acid functions and reduces their acidity. This allows a controlled release of complexed guest molecules. Oxidation regenerates the original Lewis acidity. Such reduction/oxidation cycles were also applied to an Al&#8211;P coordination polymer. sc&#8208;XRD shows the connectivity of the coordination polymer to remain unchanged, so that the polymer is stable in the neutral and reduced state. The possibility of switching such dbCOT&#8208;based PLAs and their adducts as well as the formed coordination polymers between two states with different structures and electronic compositions is of interest for the development of functional materials in the fields of electronics, optics and magnetism as well as for the development of switchable catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Ion Transport at Primary Interparticle Boundaries of Polycrystalline Lithium&#8208;Rich Oxide in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li+ transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li+ transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d&#8208;O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, 212 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrodotoxin is a neurotoxic marine alkaloid, first isolated in 1909 from pufferfish and named after the biological order tetraodontiformes. Since its structural elucidation in 1964, it has attracted the interest of synthetic organic chemists due to its exceptional polarity, complex architecture, and important biological activity. This review highlights the diversity of the tetrodotoxin natural product family and discusses the origins of derivatives, biosynthetic hypotheses, and biological activities. Furthermore, potential therapeutic applications and structure activity relationship studies are covered, along with the total syntheses of the natural product and selected derivatives that were published to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Cyclopropyl Diboronates via 1,2&#8208;Boronate Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of polysubstituted cyclopropanes has garnered considerable attention in the field of synthetic chemistry in recent years. The introduction of boron groups into cyclopropane structures enables efficient functional modification of cyclopropane frameworks through downstream derivatization of carbon&#8208;boron bonds. Herein, we report an efficient method for the rapid construction of cyclopropyl diboronates from&#160;gem&#8208;bis(boronates) and thianthrenium (TT) salts. This transformation proceeds through a 1,2&#8208;rearrangement of&#160;tetra&#8208;coordinated boron species, delivering 1,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropane diboronates in high efficiency. Subsequent borate derivatization provides access to highly diastereoselective polysubstituted cyclopropanes. This method offers a scalable and stereocontrolled approach to cyclopropane synthesis and functional diversification, expanding opportunities for the design of complex cyclopropyl architectures in medicinal chemistry, materials science, and organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Cations in Phosphates: A Pathway to Solar&#8208;Blind UV Nonlinear Optical Crystals with Phase&#8208;Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While birefringence phase&#8208;matching (PM) remains the most practical approach for nonlinear optical (NLO) frequency conversion, conventional phosphate crystals suffer from intrinsically low birefringence (&#916;n &lt; 0.05) that hinders PM behavior in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) region (&#955; &lt; 280 nm). Herein, we demonstrate a &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation engineering strategy to break this limitation, reporting two phosphite&#8208;based NLO crystals, (C2N4OH7)H2PO3 (GUPO) and C(NH2)3H2PO3 (GPO). The synergistic alignment of &#960;&#8208;conjugated guanidinium cations and [H2PO3]&#8315; anions enables record&#8208;breaking optical anisotropy (&#916;n = 0.19 @ 589.3 nm for GUPO), surpassing all known inorganic phosphates.&#160;Crucially, GUPO is the first phosphate to realize full&#8208;wavelength PM, in which the PM wavelength fully covers its optical transparency range down to 215 nm.&#160; Concurrently, GUPO exhibits exceptional second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (2.2 &#215; KDP at 1064 nm and 1.0 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BBO&#160;at 532 nm), which may enable direct 266 nm laser generation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the giant birefringence originates from oriented &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between cations, while the SHG response stems from the cooperative polarization of cations. This work establishes &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation engineering as a paradigm for designing UV NLO materials, with GUPO crystal emerging as a cheap, efficient alternative to conventional UV NLO crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Mechanostable Anticalin Scaffolds to Enhance Particle Adhesion and Targeting of CTLA&#8208;4 under Shear Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high binding strength and efficient delivery of molecular cargo to cells expressing biomarker targets is a significant challenge in drug delivery. Here, we investigated how altering the surface immobilization residue (i.e. anchor point) within a non&#8208;antibody binding scaffold called Anticalin can enhance particle adhesion to the immune checkpoint protein CTLA&#8208;4 on mammalian cells under shear stress. By introducing bio&#8208;orthogonal clickable amino acids into Anticalin at various positions and applying tension to the protein complex using single&#8208;molecule AFM force spectroscopy and bead&#8208;based adhesion assays, we elucidate the relationship between anchor point position and mechanostability of the Anticalin:(CTLA&#8208;4) complex. Multi&#8208;regression analysis of the physicochemical properties of the anchor points revealed that the distance from the anchor point on Anticalin to CTLA&#8208;4&#8217;s center of mass was a major determinant of binding strength under shear flow. These results demonstrate how anchor point engineering can enhance particle adhesion and cellular delivery to CTLA&#8208;4 targets and provides a heuristic for choosing surface immobilization points of targeting proteins such that they withstand high mechanical forces.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Hydroboration of Dienol Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration of alkenes is one of the most straightforward methods for the synthesis of chiral organoboron compounds and has been well&#8208;established. While significant progress has been made in the catalytic enantioselective hydroboration of simple dienes, the development of regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of more challenging substrates such as heteroatom&#8208;substituted or trisubstituted dienes remains limited. Here we disclose a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of dienol ethers using a commercially available Co(acac)2 catalyst and chiral ligands. The reaction exhibits good functional group compatibility and broad substrate scope, selectively affording 1,2&#8208;, 4,1&#8208;, 1,4&#8208;, and 4,3&#8208;hydroboration products in good yields and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99%). Mechanistic studies including deuterium&#8208;labeling, kinetic, and UV&#8208;Vis experiments suggest the involvement of Co&#8211;H species as active catalysts in the reactions. The powerful conversion capabilities of the products are demonstrated by various downstream transformations and the efficient preparation and late&#8208;stage elaboration of bioactive compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Indolocarbazole&#8208;Bridged Multiple Resonance Emitter through Steric Pre&#8208;Substitution for Narrowband Electroluminescence with EQE over 40%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance (MR) emitters bridged by multi&#8208;nitrogen indolocarbazoles to extend molecule skeletons could modify emission maximums without scarifying narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM), which, however, face synthesis challenges of uncontrollable borylation regioselectivity and spectral broadening issue from intermolecular aggregation. Here, a steric pre&#8208;substitution strategy is devised using tert&#8208;butylphenyl&#8208;functionalized indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole as a bridge to extend MR skeletons, not only steering regioselective Bora&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts borylation but also suppressing intermolecular interactions in films. The targeted greenish emitter therefore achieves a small electroluminescence FWHM of only 22 nm in device, matching the intrinsic photoluminescence one of 21 nm in dilute toluene. The extended skeleton also enhances the horizontal orientation of emitting dipole moment with a ratio of 90%, leading to a remarkable high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 41.0% and power efficiency of 106.5 lm W&#8208;1. The efficiency roll&#8208;off remains remarkably low with EQEs sustaining at 35.0% and 30.6% at luminance of 1,000 cd m&#8208;2 and 5,000 cd m&#8208;2, respectively. This work establishes a pre&#8208;substitution paradigm to concurrently optimize synthesis control and solid&#8208;state emission for high&#8208;performance MR emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Photoelectrochemistry in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrodes have traditionally enjoyed widespread attention as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of water and CO2 in energy research, while photoelectrochemistry with homogeneous molecular catalysts dominates the activations of more complex molecules in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great benefits to organic synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability and stability. This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro&#8208;activated) photocatalysts to dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroxyl Spillover Activated from the Strongly Coupled Ru@Mn3O4 Heterostructure to Promote Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has great potential in practical hydrogen production. However, constructing an excellent catalyst with advantages of both superior water dissociation ability and easy OH* desorption remains urgently needed and yet challenging for the alkaline HER. Herein, superior water dissociation process, facile OH* desorption, and optimized H adsorption are realized on a strongly coupled heterostructure of Ru@Mn3O4, in which Ru clusters&#160;are decorated on Mn3O4 via Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Mn bonds. The highly oxophilic Mn3O4 facilitates the water dissociation, while the formed hetero&#8208;interface can efficiently desorb OH* via hydroxyl spillover effect and optimize H adsorption. Consequently, the Ru@Mn3O4 presents remarkable HER performance with a low overpotential of 17 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 and Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8211;1, surpassing recently reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts and commercial Pt/C. More importantly, the mass activity (MA) and turnover frequency (TOF) of the Ru@Mn3O4 increase about 11 and 8&#8208;fold, respectively, compared to Pt/C at 100 mV in 1.0 M KOH. This study provides a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance HER catalysts and enhancing the catalytic performance through hydroxyl spillover effect, and sheds a light on understanding the HER mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Strategies Applied to the Late&#8208;Stage Modifications of Pharmaceutically Active Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review explores the potential of mechanochemistry in the late&#8208;stage modification of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), offering a comprehensive analysis of methods designed to transform structurally complex molecular scaffolds. By examining the scope, efficiency, and mechanistic aspects of these approaches, the review highlights protocols capable of effectively modifying structurally complex molecular scaffolds. To further assist researchers, we provide a detailed table summarizing the discussed APIs, their respective modifications, and any necessary pre&#8208;functionalizations. This resource should provide a practical guide for selecting suitable substrates to evaluate the pharmaceutical relevance of existing and novel (mechano)chemical methods.</dc:description>
