         <title>Aqueous CO2 Reduction on Si Photocathodes Functionalized by Cobalt Molecular Catalysts/Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photocathode prepared by attaching a molecular cobalt catalyst on a n+&#8208;p Si film coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibits 100&#8201;% selectivity and 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency towards CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion in aqueous media under simulated sunlight irradiation. The high performance benefits from CNTs as both a support platform for highly dispersed molecular active sites and an efficient mediator for charge transfer.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising approach for renewable fuel production. We herein report a novel strategy for preparation of hybrid photocathodes by immobilizing molecular cobalt catalysts on TiO2&#8208;protected n+&#8208;p Si electrodes (Si|TiO2) coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Upon loading a composite of CoII(BrqPy) (BrqPy=4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;quaterpyridine) catalyst and CNT on Si|TiO2, a stable 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density of &#8722;1.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was sustained over 2&#8197;h in a neutral aqueous solution with unity Faradaic efficiency and selectivity for CO production at a bias of zero overpotential (&#8722;0.11&#8197;V vs. RHE), associated with a turnover frequency (TOFCO) of 2.7&#8197;s&#8722;1. Extending the photoelectrocatalysis to 10&#8197;h, a remarkable turnover number (TONCO) of 57000 was obtained. The high performance shown here is substantially improved from the previously reported photocathodes relying on covalently anchored catalysts.

         <title>An Acid&#8208;Regulated Self&#8208;Blinking Fluorescent Probe for Resolving Whole&#8208;Cell Lysosomes with Long&#8208;Term Nanoscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LysoSR&#8208;549 as a self&#8208;blinking fluorophore for SMLM imaging of lysosomes is reported. It enables simultaneous dynamic and pH recognition of all lysosomes in the entire cell at the single&#8208;lysosome&#8208;resolved level, which allowed to resolve whole&#8208;cell lysosome subpopulations based on lysosome distribution, size, luminal pH, movement trajectories and interactions between lysosomes.







Abstract
Long&#8208;term super&#8208;resolution imaging appears to be increasingly important for unraveling organelle dynamics at the nanoscale, but is challenging due to the need for highly photostable and environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probes. Here, we report a self&#8208;blinking fluorophore that achieved 12&#8197;nm spatial resolution and 20&#8197;ms time resolution under acidic lysosomal conditions. This fluorophore was successfully applied in super&#8208;resolution imaging of lysosomal dynamics over 40&#8197;min. The pH dependence of the dye during blinking made the fluorophore sensitive to lysosomal pH. This probe enables simultaneous dynamic and pH recognition of all lysosomes in the entire cell at the single&#8208;lysosome&#8208;resolved level, which allowed us to resolve whole&#8208;cell lysosome subpopulations based on lysosomal distribution, size, and luminal pH. We also observed a variety of lysosome movement trajectories and different types of interactions modes between lysosomes.

         <title>More than a Leaving Group: N&#8208;Phenyltrifluoroacetimidate as a Remote Directing Group for Highly &#945;&#8208;Selective 1,2&#8208;cis Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidoyl group at O6 was found to be highly stereodirecting for the challenging 1,2&#8208;cis &#945;&#8208;glycosylation. Its remote participation is supported by characterization of the crucial 1,6&#8208;bridged bicyclic cation intermediates as well as other experimental evidence.







Abstract
The anomeric configuration can greatly affect the biological functions and activities of carbohydrates. Herein, we report that N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidoyl (PTFAI), a well&#8208;known leaving group for catalytic glycosylation, can act as a stereodirecting group for the challenging 1,2&#8208;cis &#945;&#8208;glycosylation. Utilizing rapidly accessible 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;OPTFAI glycosyl donors, TMSOTf&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation occurred with excellent &#945;&#8208;selectivity and broad substrate scope, and the remaining 6&#8208;OPTFAI group can be cleaved chemoselectively. The remote participation of 6&#8208;OPTFAI is supported by the first characterization of the crucial 1,6&#8208;bridged bicyclic oxazepinium ion intermediates by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy. These cations were found to be relatively stable and mainly responsible for the present stereoselectivities. Further application is highlighted in glycosylation reactions toward trisaccharide heparins as well as the convergent synthesis of chacotriose derivatives using a bulky 2,4&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated donor.

         <title>Crystalline Germanium(I) and Tin(I) Centered Radical Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isostructural series of heavy Group 14 E(I) radical anions (Ge, Sn, Pb), stabilized by a bulky diamido ligand, is reported. Comprehensive characterization of these species was achieved by using EPR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT analysis. The results obtained reveal that in all cases, the spin density of the unpaired electron resides, almost exclusively, in a p&#8208;orbital of &#960; symmetry located on the metal center itself.







Abstract
An isostructural series of heavy Group 14 E(I) radical anions (Ge, Sn, Pb), stabilized by a bulky xanthene&#8208;based diamido ligand are reported. The radical anions were synthesised by the one&#8208;electron reduction of their corresponding E(II) precursor complexes with sodium naphthalenide in THF, yielding the radical anions as charge&#8208;separated sodium salts. The series of main group radicals have been comprehensively characterized by EPR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT analysis, which reveal that in all cases, the spin density of the unpaired electron almost exclusively resides in a p&#8208;orbital of &#960; symmetry located on the Group 14 center.

         <title>PO43&#8722; Coordinated Robust Single&#8208;Atom Platinum Catalyst for Selective Polyol Oxidation**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom Pt1/hydroxyapatite (HAP) catalyst is successfully synthesized by a simple and green hydrothermal strategy. Benefiting from the strong PO43&#8722;&#8208;coordination effect, Pt1/HAP exhibits outstanding catalytic selectivity and catalyst stability without Pt leaching for the selective oxidation of C2&#8211;C4 polyols to corresponding primary hydroxy acids over long periods of operation (&gt;160&#8197;h).







Abstract
Achieving efficient catalytic conversion over a heterogeneous catalyst with excellent resistance against leaching is still a grand challenge for sustainable chemical synthesis in aqueous solution. Herein, we devised a single&#8208;atom Pt1/hydroxyapatite (HAP) catalyst via a simple hydrothermal strategy. Gratifyingly, this robust Pt1/HAP catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic selectivity and catalyst stability for the selective oxidation of C2&#8211;C4 polyols to corresponding primary hydroxy acids. It is found that the Pt&#8722;(O&#8722;P) linkages with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing function of PO43&#8722; (Pt1&#8722;OPO43&#8722; pair active site) not only realize the activation of the C&#8722;H bond, but also destabilize the transition state from adsorbed hydroxy acids toward the C&#8722;C cleavage, resulting in the sharply increased selectivity of hydroxy acids. Moreover, the strong PO43&#8722;&#8208;coordination effect provides electrostatic stabilization for single&#8208;atom Pt, ensuring the highly efficient catalysis of Pt1/HAP for over 160&#8197;hours with superior leaching resistance.

         <title>A Glycoform&#8208;Resolved Dual&#8208;Modal Ratiometric Immunoassay Improves the Diagnostic Precision for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking both terminal sialic acid and core fucose into account, a molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs)&#8208;based dual&#8208;modal ratiometric immunoassay was developed for the precise diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Three MIPs orthogonally recognize the N&#8208;terminal epitope, C&#8208;terminal epitope and glycans of glycoprotein biomarkers, and dual&#8208;modal detection provides two independent glycans/glycoprotein values, enabling self&#8208;validating, high&#8208;contrast, and more precise diagnosis compared to antibodies&#8208;based methods.







Abstract
The glycosylation pattern of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) paves the basis for precise early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, existing analytical methods ignore the contribution of terminal sialic acid, which has been reported to be highly connected with HCC. Besides, the development of diagnostic assays is severely hindered by the preparation of anti&#8208;glycans antibodies. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), as synthetic antibody mimics, provide unique strengths to address these issues. Herein, we report a MIPs&#8208;based dual&#8208;modal ratiometric immunoassay for precise HCC diagnosis. Using a &#8220;pit one against ten&#8221; MIP to recognize a subset of glycans containing sialic acid and/or core fucose, we demonstrated our assay exhibited improved precision as compared with ELISA. This assay provided not only a glycoform&#8208;resolved method for precise HCC diagnosis, but also a new paradigm for developing antibody mimics via molecular imprinting towards challenging biomedical applications.

         <title>Amplified Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence Behavior Triggered by Helical Nanofibers from Chiral Co&#8208;assembly Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two chiral binaphthyl polymers (  R  /  S  &#8208;P1  and  R  /  S  &#8208;P2  ) with different dihedral angles of binaphthyl moiety were chosen as chiral inducers to construct chiral co&#8208;assemblies with an achiral pyrene&#8208;naphthalimide dye (  NPy  ) and then acted as the emitting layer (EML) of CP&#8208;EL devices. The anchored dihedral angle of  R  /  S  &#8208;P2  not only exhibited the enhanced chirality signal, but also had a strong chirality&#8208;inducing effect on the achiral  NPy  dye in the chiral co&#8208;assembly (  R  /  S  &#8208;P2)  0.6  &#8208;(NPy)  0.4  . After annealing at 120 &#176;C, the CPL signal (|  g  em  |) of ordered helical nano&#8208;fibers  (  R  /  S  &#8208;P2)  0.6  &#8208;(NPy)  0.4  was amplified to 5.6&#215;10  &#8208;2  , which was about 6&#8208;fold larger than that of  (  R  /  S  &#8208;P1)  0.6  &#8208;(NPy)  0.4  . The amplified  g  em  value of  (  R  /  S  &#8208;P2)  0.6  &#8208;(NPy)  0.4  was due to the formation of a helical co&#8208;assembly through the strong  &#960;&#8208;&#960;  stacking interaction between the  R  /  S  &#8208;P2  and the achiral  NPy  . This kind of ordered helical nano&#8208;fibers (  R  /  S  &#8208;P2)  0.6  &#8208;(NPy)  0.4  acted as the EML of CP&#8208;OLEDs, and achieved an excellent CP&#8208;EL performance (|  g  EL  | = 4.8&#215;10  &#8208;2  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Isotope Effects on Aqueous Electrolyte for Electrochemical Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As two stable hydrogen isotopes, protium and deuterium show magnified isotope effects in physicochemical properties due to the significantly varied atomic masses. In this work, aqueous electrolytes based on heavy water (D  2  O) and light water (H  2  O) were prepared to reveal the electrochemical isotope effects between the hydrogen isotopes. The covalent hydrogen&#8208;oxygen bond and intermolecular hydrogen bond in D  2  O are much stronger than those in H  2  O, making them thermodynamically more stable. Compared with the H  2  O&#8208;based electrolyte, the D  2  O&#8208;based electrolyte shows a broader electrochemical window, a higher percentage of coordinated water and a longer lifetime of hydrogen bond. Because of the above electrochemical isotope effects, the D  2  O&#8208;based electrolyte shows high anodic stability against operation of high&#8208;voltage layered oxide cathode materials including LiCoO  2  and LiNi  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  O  2  , which enables long cycle life and favorable rate performance of aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>High Resolution NMR H/D Exchange of Human Superoxide Dismutase Inclusion Bodies Reveals Significant Native Features Despite Structural Heterogeneity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein aggregation is central to aging, disease and biotechnology. While there has been recent progress in defining structural features of cellular protein aggregates, many aspects remain unclear due to heterogeneity of aggregates presenting obstacles to characterization. Here we report high&#8208;resolution analysis of cellular inclusion bodies (IBs) of immature human superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutants using NMR quenched amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange (qHDX), FTIR and Congo red binding. The extent of aggregation is correlated with mutant global stability and, notably, the free energy of native dimer dissociation, indicating contributions of native&#8208;like monomer associations to IB formation. This is further manifested by a common pattern of extensive protection against H/D exchange throughout nine mutant SOD1s despite their diverse characteristics. These results reveal multiple aggregation&#8208;prone regions in SOD1 and illuminate how aggregation may occur via an ensemble of pathways</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrogenolysis of silyl triflates and halides (I, Br) to hydrosilanes is unlocked by using arylborane Lewis acids as catalysts. In the presence of a nitrogen base, the catalyst acts as a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) able to split H  2  and generate a boron hydride intermediate capable of reducing (pseudo)halosilanes. This metal&#8208;free organocatalytic system is competitive with metal&#8208;based catalysts and enables the formation of a variety of hydrosilanes at r.t. in high yields (&gt;85&#160;%) under a low pressure of H  2  (&#8804; 10&#160;bar).</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing Fast Synthesis of High&#8208;silica Zeolite Y with Remarkable Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;silica zeolite Y (FAU) plays a vital role in (petro)chemical industries. However, the slow nucleation and growth kinetics of high&#8208;silica FAU framework limit its direct synthesis and the improvement of framework SiO  2  /Al  2  O  3  ratio (SAR). Here, a facile strategy is developed to realize the fast crystallization of high&#8208;silica zeolite Y, which involves the combination of high crystallization temperature, ultra&#8208;stable Y (USY) seeds and efficient organic&#8208;structure directing agent (OSDA). The synthesis can be finished in 5&#8208;16 h at 160  o  C and with tunable SAR up to 18.2. Combining experiments and theoretical calculations, the key factors affecting crystallization kinetics and phase purity are elucidated. Moreover, the crystallization process was monitored to reveal the fast crystal growth mechanism. The high&#8208;silica products possess high (hydro)thermal stability and abundant strong acid sites, which endow them excellent catalytic cracking performance, obviously superior to commercial USY.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective &#947;&#8208;Arylation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Butenolides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#947;&#8208;Butenolide and &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone scaffolds are two types of important core structures in numerous natural products and bioactive targets. However, methods to construct the chiral quaternary arylated &#947;&#8208;butenolide are rarely explored. We herein report an efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective &#947;&#8208;arylation of &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated butenolides with aryl bromides, which shows high &#947;&#8208;selectivity, good functional group tolerance and excellent enantioselectivity. Notably, this protocol also allows for facile construction of tricyclic tetrahydroindolines and tetrahydroisoquinolinones in one step. DFT calculations are consistent with the experimental results, suggesting that the &#947;&#8208;arylation is favoured than the &#945;&#8208;arylation. Finally, this method is applied to the rapid synthesis of natural product (  R  )&#8208;(+)  &#8208;  boivinianin A.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The glycosylative modification of peptides could improve the pharmacological properties of peptide drugs and deliver them efficiently to the target sites. Compared with  O  &#8208;/  N  &#8208;glycosides,  C  &#8208;glycosides exhibit more metabolic stability. We here disclose the first example of visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and Cu&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective  C  &#8208;glycosylation. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with various carbohydrate substrates, as demonstrated with a series of monosaccharides and a disaccharide, and are amenable to the synthesis of a wide variety of  C  &#8208;glycoamino acids and  C  &#8208;glycopeptidomimetics with good yields and excellent stereoselectivities. The dual&#8208;functional photocatalyst formed in situ via coordination of the glycine derivative and the chiral phosphine Cu complex could not only catalyze the photoredox process but also control the  s  tereoselectivity of the glycosylation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Regulation of Ni Single Atom by Confined Ni Nanoparticles for Energy&#8208;Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic modulation of atomic dispersed active sites is promising to boost the catalytic activity, which is however remains a challenge. Here we show a cooperative Ni single&#8208;atom on nanoparticle catalyst (NiSA/NP) via direct solid&#8208;state pyrolysis, where Ni nanoparticles donate electrons to Ni(i)&#8208;N&#8208;C sites via carbon nanotubes network, achieving a high CO current density of 346 mA cm  &#8208;2  at &#8208;0.5 V vs RHE in an alkaline flow cell. When coupled with a NiFe&#8208;based oxygen evolution anode into a zero&#8208;gap membrane electrolyzer, it delivers an industrial&#8208;relevant CO current density of 310 mA cm  &#8208;2  at a low cell voltage of &#8208;2.3 V, corresponding to an overall energy efficiency of 57%. The superior CO  2  electroreduction performance is attributed to the enhanced adsorption of key intermediate COOH* on electron&#8208;rich Ni single atom, together with the dense active sites.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical methods are promising to address the ever&#8208;increasing demands for chirality analysis in drug discovery and related fields because they are amenable to high&#8208;throughput screening. Noncovalent recognition&#8208;based chiroptical sensing by employing circular dichroism spectroscopy is especially appealing due to their fast equilibrium kinetics, wide substrate scope, and potential in sustainable development. In this minireview, we give an overview on this emerging field. General aspects involving molecular recognition and chirality transfer are analysed. Chirality sensors are discussed by dividing them into three classes according to their structural features. Applications of these chirality sensors in chirality analysis of the products of asymmetric reactions and in real&#8208;time monitoring of reaction kinetics are demonstrated with selected examples. Moreover, challenges and research directions in this field are also pointed out.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissipative Control over the Toehold&#8208;Mediated DNA Strand&#160;Displacement Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we show a general approach to achieve dissipative control over toehold&#8208;mediated strand&#8208;displacement, the most widely employed reaction in the field of DNA nanotechnology. The approach relies on rationally re&#8208;engineering the classic strand displacement reaction such that the high&#8208;energy invader strand (fuel) is converted into a low&#8208;energy waste product through an energy&#8208;dissipating reaction allowing the spontaneous return to the original state over time. We show that such dissipative control over the toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement process is reversible (up to 10 cycles), highly controllable and enables unique temporal activation of DNA systems. We show here two possible applications of this strategy: the transient labelling of DNA structures and the additional temporal control of cascade reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Nanolayer For Copper Film Oxidation Mitigation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The wide use of copper is limited by rapid oxidation, which deteriorates its electrical and mechanical properties. Main oxidation mitigation approaches involve alloying or surface passivation technologies using organic molecules or inorganic&#8208;based materials. However, surface alloying often modifies the physical properties of copper, while surface passivation is characterized with limited thermal and chemical stability. Herein, we demonstrate an electrochemical approach for surface&#8208;anchoring of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) nanolayer on copper electrodes. NHC&#8208;nanolayer was prepared by electro&#8208;deposition of alkyne&#8208;functionalized imidazolium cations. Water reduction reaction generated high concentration of hydroxide ions in proximity to the copper electrode. The hydroxide ions deprotonated the alkyne&#8208;functionalized imidazolium cations, inducing the self&#8208;assembly of NHCs on the electrode&#8217;s surface. In addition, hydroxide ions deprotonated the alkyne group and enabled on&#8208;surface polymerization reaction by coupling surface&#8208;anchored and solvated NHCs that resulted the formation of 2 nm thick NHC&#8208;nanolayer. Copper film coated with NHC&#8208;nanolayer demonstrated high oxidation resistance at elevated temperature and in alkaline conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and Color&#8208;Tunable Dual&#8208;Mode Afterglow from Large&#8208;Area and Flexible Polymer&#8208;Based Transparent Films for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It remains a great challenge to develop polymer&#8208;based materials with efficient and color&#8208;tunable organic afterglow. Two indolocarbazole derivatives IaCzA and IbCzA have been synthesized and doped into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrices. It is found that the resulting films can produce unique dual&#8208;mode afterglow, which is composed of persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and ultralong organic phosphorescence. Besides, the IbCzA&#8208;doped PVA film exhibits intense blue afterglow with  &#934;  afterglow  and  &#964;  afterglow  up to 19.8% and 1.81 s, respectively, representing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dual&#8208;mode organic afterglow performance. Moreover, our reported film has high flexibility, excellent transparency, and large&#8208;area producibility; and the afterglow color of the film can be linearly tuned by temperature. Inspired by these distinctive properties, the PVA doped with IbCzA was employed as temperature&#8208;sensitive security ink for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Defluoroallylation of 4&#8208;Trifluoromethylpyridines Enabled by Umpolung C&#8722;F Bond Activation**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective defluorinative transformation of the trifluoromethyl group represents a formidable challenge. An asymmetric defluoroallylation reaction of 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridines and &#8208;pyrimidines is reported, which features an umpolung C&#8722;F bond activation, a broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Carbon&#8211;fluorine bond activation of the trifluoromethyl group represents an important approach to fluorine&#8208;containing molecules. While selective defluorinative functionalization reactions of CF3&#8208;containing substrates have been achieved by invoking difluorocarbocation, difluorocarboradical, or difluoroorganometallic species as the key intermediates, the transformations via fluorocarbanion mechanism only achieved limited success. Furthermore, the enantioselective defluorinative transformation of the CF3 group remained a formidable challenge. Here we report a defluorinative functionalization reaction of 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridines involving difluoro(pyrid&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyl anion as the key intermediate, which was developed based upon our previous studies on the N&#8208;boryl pyridyl anion chemistry. In particular, asymmetric defluoroallylation of 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridines and &#8208;pyrimidines could be achieved by using Ir&#8208;catalysis to forge a difluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted chiral center.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Layered Cu5 Nanoclusters on FeS2 with Dual Catalytic Sites for Efficient and Selective H2O2 Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual Cu&#8722;Fe catalytic centers situated at the perimeter region of Cu5/FeS2 facilitate H2O2 adsorption and barrierless decomposition into &#8901;OH through forming a bridging Cu&#8208;O&#8208;O&#8208;Fe structure, thereby realizing selective H2O2 activation with high efficiency and enabling excellent degradation activities of refractory organic pollutants.







Abstract
Regulating the distribution of reactive oxygen species generated from H2O2 activation is the prerequisite to ensuring the efficient and safe use of H2O2 in the chemistry and life science fields. Herein, we demonstrate that constructing a dual Cu&#8722;Fe site through the self&#8208;assembly of single&#8208;atomic&#8208;layered Cu5 nanoclusters onto a FeS2 surface achieves selective H2O2 activation with high efficiency. Unlike its unitary Cu or Fe counterpart, the dual Cu&#8722;Fe sites residing at the perimeter zone of the Cu5/FeS2 interface facilitate H2O2 adsorption and barrierless decomposition into &#8901;OH via forming a bridging Cu&#8208;O&#8208;O&#8208;Fe complex. The robust in situ formation of &#8901;OH governed by this atomic&#8208;layered catalyst enables the effective oxidation of several refractory toxic pollutants across a broad pH range, including alachlor, sulfadimidine, p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, p&#8208;chlorophenol, p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene. This work highlights the concept of building a dual catalytic site in manipulating selective H2O2 activation on the surface molecular level towards efficient environmental control and beyond.

         <title>Enantiomeric Water&#8208;Soluble Octopus[3]arenes for Highly Enantioselective Recognition of Chiral Ammonium Salts in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiomeric water&#8208;soluble octopus[3]arenes with rigid hexagonal structures and stable chiral hydrophobic cavities were easily synthesized. They exhibited highly enantioselective recognition towards three pairs of chiral ammonium salts in water with the association constant up to 106 and the S/R selectivity up to 12.89.







Abstract
Study of enantioselective recognition in water by synthetic chiral macrocyclic receptors is undoubtedly of theoretical and practical significance, but it is a big challenge to achieve the enantioselective recognition with both high enantioselectivity and high affinity in water probably due to the deficiency of such water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic receptors with stable chiral cavities. Herein, we report a new class of chiral macrocyclic arenes named octopus[3]arenes. The enantiomeric macrocycles are composed of three homochiral ethenoanthracene subunits, and they can be synthesized by two pathways and then easily converted into water&#8208;soluble octopus[3]arenes P&#8208;1 and M&#8208;1. Notably, P&#8208;1 and M&#8208;1 with the rigid hexagonal structures and stable chiral hydrophobic cavities exhibit highly enantioselective recognition towards three pairs of chiral ammonium salts in water with the association constant up to 106&#8197;M&#8722;1 and the S/R selectivity up to 12.89.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Controlled Condensation of [Mo2O5(PTC4A)2]6&#8722; Metalloligand in Stepwise Assembly of Hexagonal and Rectangular Ag18 Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two Ag18 nanoclusters with different geometries are isolated by employing the [Mo2O5(PTC4A)2]6&#8722; metalloligand. The condensation degree of the metalloligand was strongly dependent on the alcohols. In the absence of alcohols, the [Mo2O5(PTC4A)2]6&#8722; can be controllably cyclized to form a wheel&#8208;like [(Mo2O5PTC4A)6]12&#8722; to trap silver ions. In contrast, the similar cyclization reaction is completely blocked in the presence of alcohols.







Abstract
Stepwise assembly starting from a preassembled metalloligand is a promising approach to obtain otherwise unattainable silver nanoclusters, but hard to be intrinsically identified due to the lack of convincing evidence to justify such a process. Herein, hexagonal and rectangular Ag18 nanoclusters are constructed from the [Mo2O5(PTC4A)2]6&#8722; (H4PTC4A=p&#8208;phenyl&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene) metalloligand through stepwise assembly. The formation of the metalloligand is confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, then assembled with silver ions to form two geometrically different Ag18 nanoclusters in different solvents. The cyclization from the metalloligand to [(Mo2O5PTC4A)6]12&#8722; can be realized without alcohols and otherwise blocked by them. The installation of this metalloligand not only provides comprehensive understanding of how the solvents regulate the silver nanocluster structures, but also brings new insights for the controllable ligand metallization and subsequent condensation.

         <title>Combination of Knoevenagel Polycondensation and Water&#8208;Assisted Dynamic Michael&#8208;Addition&#8208;Elimination for the Synthesis of Vinylene&#8208;Linked 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

Synthesis of vinylene&#8208;linked 2D COFs via Knoevenagel polycondensation and in situ water&#8208;assisted Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination: The addition of water can accelerate the Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination for C=C bond exchange.







Abstract
Vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic frameworks (V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs), belonging to the class of two&#8208;dimensional conjugated polymers, have attracted increasing attention due to their extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation over the 2D backbones associated with high chemical stability. The Knoevenagel polycondensation has been demonstrated as a robust synthetic method to provide cyano (CN)&#8208;substituted V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs with unique optoelectronic, magnetic, and redox properties. Despite the successful synthesis, it remains elusive for the relevant polymerization mechanism, which leads to relatively low crystallinity and poor reproducibility. In this work, we demonstrate the novel synthesis of CN&#8208;substituted V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs via the combination of Knoevenagel polycondensation and water&#8208;assisted dynamic Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination, abbreviated as KMAE polymerization. The existence of C=C bond exchange between two diphenylacrylonitriles (M1 and M6) is firstly confirmed via in situ high&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy study of model reactions. Notably, the intermediate M4 synthesized via Michael&#8208;addition can proceed the Michael&#8208;elimination quantitatively, leading to an efficient C=C bond exchange, unambiguously confirming the dynamic nature of Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination. Furthermore, the addition of water can significantly promote the reaction rate of Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination for highly efficient C=C bond exchange within 5&#8197;mins. As a result, the KMAE polymerization provides a highly efficient strategy for the synthesis of CN&#8208;substituted V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs with high crystallinity, as demonstrated by four examples of V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;TFPB&#8208;PDAN, V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;TFPT&#8208;PDAN, V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;TFPB&#8208;BDAN, and V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;HATN&#8208;BDAN, based on the simulated and experimental powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns as well as N2&#8208;adsorption&#8211;desorption measurements. Moreover, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR&#8208;TEM) analysis shows crystalline domain sizes ranging from 20 to 100&#8197;nm for the newly synthesized V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs.

         <title>Single&#8208;Vesicle Electrochemistry Following Repetitive Stimulation Reveals a Mechanism for Plasticity Changes with Iron Deficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron deficiency&#8208;induced neurochemical changes are linked to cognitive impairment. Alteration in plasticity is observed as a decrease in fractional release during repetitive stimulation and iron deficiency. This alteration in fractional release is likely to be one of the mechanisms that underlie the negative impact of iron deficiency on plasticity, and the long&#8208;term deficits in learning and memory.







Abstract
Deficiency of iron, the most abundant transition metal in the brain and important for neuronal activity, is known to affect synaptic plasticity, causing learning and memory deficits. How iron deficiency impacts plasticity by altering neurotransmission at the cellular level is not fully understood. We used electrochemical methods to study the effect of iron deficiency on plasticity with repetitive stimulation. We show that during iron deficiency, repetitive stimulation causes significant decrease in exocytotic release without changing vesicular content. This results in a lower fraction of release, opposite to the control group, upon repetitive stimulation. These changes were partially reversible by iron repletion. This finding suggests that iron deficiency has a negative effect on plasticity by decreasing the fraction of vesicular release in response to repetitive stimulation. This provides a putative mechanism for how iron deficiency modulates plasticity.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of 3H&#8208;Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
General and efficient asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of 3H&#8208;indoles has been realized using a well&#8208;defined chiral pincer manganese catalyst, with up to 99&#8201;% ee and a record TON of 72&#8201;350 in an earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;catalyzed AH reaction.







Abstract
The asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of 3H&#8208;indoles represents an ideal approach to the synthesis of useful chiral indoline scaffolds. However, very few catalytic systems based on precious metals have been developed to realize this challenging reaction. Herein, we report a Mn&#8208;catalyzed AH of 3H&#8208;indoles with excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The kinetic resolution of racemic 3H&#8208;indoles by AH was also achieved with high s&#8208;factors to construct quaternary stereocenters. Many acid&#8208;sensitive functional groups, which cannot be tolerated when using a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ruthenium catalyst, were compatible with manganese catalysis. This new process expands the scope of this transformation and highlights the uniqueness of earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysis. The reaction could proceed with catalyst loadings at the parts per million (ppm) level with an exceptional turnover number of 72&#8201;350. This is the highest value yet reported for an earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;catalyzed AH reaction.

         <title>Modular Generation of (Iodinated) Polyarenes Using Triethylgermane as Orthogonal Masking Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complementary modular coupling approach to the widely employed Suzuki coupling is disclosed herein, relying on organogermane&#8208;containing building blocks paired with air&#8208;stable PdI dimer based bond construction, which allows to significantly shorten the reaction times and close gaps in the accessible compound space.







Abstract
While the modular construction of molecules from suitable building blocks is a powerful means to more rapidly generate a diversity of molecules than through customized syntheses, the further evolution of the underlying coupling methodology is key to realize widespread applications. We herein disclose a complementary modular coupling approach to the widely employed Suzuki coupling strategy of boron containing precursors, which relies on organogermane containing building blocks as key orthogonal functionality and an electrophilic (rather than nucleophilic) unmasking event paired with air&#8208;stable PdI dimer based bond construction. This allows to significantly shorten the reaction times for the iterative coupling steps and/or to close gaps in the accessible compound space, enabling straightforward access also to iodinated compounds.

         <title>Oligomer&#8208;Assisted Photoactive Layers Enable &gt;18&#8201;% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of oligomer&#8208;assisted high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs) was proposed. Developing the oligomer&#8208;assisted OSCs is a facile and general strategy with the combination of the advantages of both binary and ternary devices, which enables &gt;18&#8201;% device efficiency together with improved stability.







Abstract
Although ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) have unique advantages in improving device performance, the morphology assembly in the ternary&#8208;phase would be more uncertain or complex than that in the binary&#8208;phase. Here, we propose a new concept of oligomer&#8208;assisted photoactive layers for high&#8208;performance OSCs. The formed alloy&#8208;like phase of the oligomer&#8201;:&#8201;host polymer blend enabled the oligomer&#8208;assisted OSCs to fuse the advantages of both binary and ternary devices, exhibiting substantially enhanced performance and stability compared to the control devices. With the addition of oligomers, outstanding efficiencies of 17.33&#8201;% for a PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 device, 18.32&#8201;% for a PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9 device, and 17.13&#8201;% for a PM6/Y6 pseudo&#8208;bilayer device were achieved, all of which are one of the highest values in their corresponding fields. The improved performance originated from the downshift energy levels, enhanced light absorption, optimized blend morphology, favorable charge dynamics, and reduced non&#8208;radiative energy loss.

         <title>Tuning the Spin State of the Iron Center by Bridge&#8208;Bonded Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti Ligands for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin&#8208;state tuning for atomic Fe center s(FeN3O) is attained through introducing an axial Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti bridge bond in atomic&#8208;Fe doped polymer&#8208;like quantum dots/ultrathin o&#8208;terminated MXene (o&#8208;MQFe) hybrids. This low&#8208;to&#8208;medium spin&#8208;state transition gives the o&#8208;MQFe catalyst stronger O2 adsorption affinity and thus a higher intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity.







Abstract
Exploring functional substrates and precisely regulating the electronic structures of atomic metal active species with moderate spin state are of great importance yet remain challenging. Hereon, we provide an axial Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti ligand regulated spin&#8208;state transition strategy to improve the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Fe centers. Theoretical calculations indicate that Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti ligands in FeN3O&#8208;O&#8208;Ti can induce a low&#8208;to&#8208;medium spin&#8208;state transition and optimize O2 adsorption by FeN3O. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the oriented catalyst was prepared from atomic&#8208;Fe&#8208;doped polymer&#8208;like quantum dots and ultrathin o&#8208;terminated MXene. The optimal catalyst exhibits an intrinsic activity that is almost 5&#8197;times higher than the control sample (without axial Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti ligands). It also delivers a superior performance in Zn&#8208;air batteries and H2/O2 anion exchange membrane fuel cells in a wide&#8208;temperature range.

         <title>Disproportionation of Nitric Oxide at a Surface&#8208;Bound Nickel Porphyrinoid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel tetraphenyl porphyrins deposited in vacuo on a copper surface are reactive towards nitric oxide disproportionation already at room temperature. The high chemical reactivity of nitrogen oxides species, eventually present in the residual gas background, and of the possible reaction intermediates yields a challenging complexity, where even a small fraction of contamination can change the scenario.







Abstract
Uncommon metal oxidation states in porphyrinoid cofactors are responsible for the activity of many enzymes. The F430 and P450nor co&#8208;factors, with their reduced NiI&#8208; and FeIII&#8208;containing tetrapyrrolic cores, are prototypical examples of biological systems involved in methane formation and in the reduction of nitric oxide, respectively. Herein, using a comprehensive range of experimental and theoretical methods, we raise evidence that nickel tetraphenyl porphyrins deposited in vacuo on a copper surface are reactive towards nitric oxide disproportionation at room temperature. The interpretation of the measurements is far from being straightforward due to the high reactivity of the different nitrogen oxides species (eventually present in the residual gas background) and of the possible reaction intermediates. The picture is detailed in order to disentangle the challenging complexity of the system, where even a small fraction of contamination can change the scenario.

         <title>para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Borylation of Aromatic Quaternary Ammonium and Phosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic sulfamate ligand based on a biphenyl&#8208;phenanthroline skeleton was designed and applied to the para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of aromatic quaternary ammonium and phosphonium salts. Mechanistic studies and computational analysis elucidated the origin of this unusual selectivity.







Abstract
Aromatic ammonium and phosphonium salts are important synthetic intermediates and multifunctional materials, but para&#8208;selective functionalization of the aromatic salts remains a challenge. Here we develop an ionic ligand based on our newly designed &#8220;biphenyl&#8208;phenanthroline&#8221; skeleton and realize the Ir&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of seven types of aromatic quaternary ammonium and phosphonium salts. Gram&#8208;scale transformation, late&#8208;stage elaboration for drug molecule, and diversification of borylated products demonstrate the potential utility of this reaction. The mechanistic studies and computational analysis elucidate the origin of para&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Allylboration of Alkynes with Allylic gem&#8208;Dichlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective coupling of terminal alkynes, bis(pinacolato)diboron and allylic gem&#8208;dichlorides is reported. The method uses a chiral NHC&#8722;Cu catalyst which generates, in a single step, synthetically versatile chiral skipped dienes bearing a Z&#8208;alkenyl chloride, a trisubstituted E&#8208;alkenyl boronate and a bis&#8208;allylic stereocenter.







Abstract
Allylic gem&#8208;dichlorides are shown to be efficient substrates for catalytic asymmetric allylboration of alkynes. The method employs a chiral NHC&#8722;Cu catalyst capable of generating in a single step chiral skipped dienes bearing a Z&#8208;alkenyl chloride, a trisubstituted E&#8208;alkenyl boronate and a bis&#8208;allylic stereocenter with excellent levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. This high degree of functionalization makes these products versatile building blocks as illustrated with the synthesis of several optically active compounds. DFT calculations support the key presence of a metal cation bridge ligand&#8211;substrate interaction and account for the stereoselectivity outcome.

     alt="Enantio- and Diastereoselective Copper-Catalyzed Allylboration of Alkynes with Allylic gem-Dichlorides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly chemo-, regio-, enantio- and diastereoselective coupling of terminal alkynes, bis(pinacolato)diboron and allylic &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-dichlorides is reported. The method uses a chiral NHC&#8722;Cu catalyst which generates, in a single step, synthetically versatile chiral skipped dienes bearing a &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-alkenyl chloride, a trisubstituted &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-alkenyl boronate and a bis-allylic stereocenter.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive C(sp2)&#8722;Si Coupling of Chlorohydrosilanes via Si&#8722;Cl Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new C&#8722;Si bond&#8208;forming reaction between R&#8722;X and Cl&#8722;Si(H)R2 was achieved using reductive nickel catalysis. This method offers access to structurally diverse aryl&#8208; and alkenylhydrosilanes from phenol and ketone derivatives. The reaction can be conducted on gram scale and allows for incorporating a hydrosilane moiety into biologically active molecules.







Abstract
We report here a new method for the synthesis of organohydrosilanes from phenols and ketones. This method is established through reductive C&#8722;Si coupling of chlorohydrosilanes via unconventional Si&#8722;Cl cleavage. The reaction offers access to aryl&#8208; and alkenylhydrosilanes with a scope that is complementary to those of the established methods. Electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;poor, and ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;substituted (hetero)aryl electrophiles, as well as cyclic and acyclic alkenyl electrophiles, were coupled successfully. Functionalities, including Grignard&#8208;sensitive groups (e.g., primary amine, amide, phenol, ketone, ester, and free indole), acid&#8208;sensitive groups (e.g., ketal and THP protection), alkyl&#8208;Cl, pyridine, furan, thiophene, Ar&#8208;Bpin, and Ar&#8208;SiMe3, were tolerated. Gram&#8208;scale reaction, incorporation of &#8208;Si(H)R2 into complex biologically active molecules, and derivatization of formed organohydrosilanes are demonstrated.

         <title>Strong Nonlinearity Induced by Coaxial Alignment of Polar Chain and Dense [BO3] Units in CaZn2(BO3)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new beryllium&#8208;free borate with double&#8208;layered configuration was rationally designed. It shows a large phase&#8208;matching second harmonic generation reponse, which is 38 times higher than that of its barium analogue. These findings show the great significance of using tetrahedra to design nonlinear optical crystals and also verify the feasibility of using simple non&#8208;isomorphic substitution to induce giant second&#8208;order nonlinearity enhancement.







Abstract
Discovery of new efficient nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with large second&#8208;order nonlinearity for the short&#8208;wave ultraviolet spectral region (&#955;PM&#8804;266&#8197;nm, PM=phase&#8208;matching) is still very challenging. Herein, a new beryllium&#8208;free borate CaZn2(BO3)2 with Sr2Be2B2O7 (SBBO) double&#8208;layered like configuration was rationally designed, which not only preserves the structural merits but also eliminates the limitations of the SBBO crystal. CaZn2(BO3)2 shows a large PM second harmonic generation (SHG) reponse of 3.8&#215;KDP, which is 38 times higher than that of its barium analogue. This enhancement mainly originates from the 1[Zn2O6]&#8734; polar chains with a large net dipole moment and [BO3] units with a high NLO active density. Our findings show the great significance of the [ZnO4] tetrahedra introduced strategy to design beryllium&#8208;free SBBO&#8208;type NLO crystals and also verify the feasibility of using simple non&#8208;isomorphic substitution to induce giant second&#8208;order nonlinearity enhancement.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Adhesive and Conductive Gels with Anion&#8208;Coordinated Triple Helicate Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of anion&#8208;coordinated assemblies into functional soft materials remains a major challenge. To this end, four  C2&#8208;symmetric anion&#8208;binding ligands equipped with ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;bis(urea) and amine or amide ends  were designed, which  generated A2L3  triple helical architectures  upon self&#8208;assembly with phosphate ions.  Hierarchical intermolecular hydrogen bonds among the terminal amine/amide groups and urea moieties resulted in the formation of functional gels. The obtained gels were further applied for conductive adhesion between different surfaces,  displaying excellent flexibility and selective wettability. The viscoelastic gels constructed from anion&#8208;coordinated assemblies described in this work represent the first example of a new class of anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rare Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Based on Tailorable Mn8&#8208;Cluster Showing Smart Responsiveness to Aromatic Guests and Capacity of Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and creation of soft porous crystals combining regularity and flexibility may promote potential applications on gas storage and separation due to their deformable framework's responsiveness to external stimuli. The flexibility of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) relies on alterable degrees of freedom that are mainly provided by organic linkers or the junctions linking organic and inorganic building units. Herein, we report a new dynamic MOF whose flexibility originates from an unprecedented tailorable Mn  8  O  38  &#8208;cluster and shows simultaneous coordination geometry changes and ligand migration that are reversibly driven by guest exchange. This provides an extra degree of freedom to the framework&#8217;s deformation, resulting in three&#8208;dimensional variations in the framework that subtly respond to varied aromatic molecules. The gas adsorption behavior of this flexible MOF was evaluated, and the selective separation of light hydrocarbons and Freon gases is achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Cold Denaturation of Proteins in the Absence of Solvent: Implications for Protein Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effect of temperature on the stability of proteins is well explored above 298K, but harder to track experimentally below 273K. Variable temperature ion mobility mass spectrometry (VT IM&#8208;MS) allows us to measure the structure of molecules at sub&#8208;ambient temperatures. Here we monitor conformational changes that occur to two isotypes of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on cooling by measuring their collision cross sections (CCS) at discrete drift gas temperatures from 295 to 160K. The CCS at 250K is larger than predicted from collisional theory and experimental data at 295K. This restructure is attributed to change in the strength of stabilizing intermolecular interactions. Below 250K the CCS of the mAbs increases in line with prediction implying no rearrangement. Comparing data from isotypes suggest disulfide bridging influences thermal structural rearrangement. These findings indicate that  in vacuo  deep&#8208;freezing minimizes denaturation and maintains the native fold and VT IM&#8208;MS measurements at sub ambient temperatures provide new insights to the phenomenon of cold denaturation.</dc:description>

These findings indicate that  in vacuo  deep-freezing minimizes denaturation and maintains the native fold and VT IM-MS measurements at sub ambient temperatures provide new insights to the phenomenon of cold denaturation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Engineering of Palladium Nanocrystals: Decoupling the Activity of Different Surface Sites on Nanocrystal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The existence of various surface active sites within a nanocrystal (NC) catalyst complicates understanding their respective catalytic properties and designing an optimal catalyst structure for a desired catalytic reaction. Here, we developed a novel approach that allows unequivocal investigation on the intrinsic catalytic reactivity of the edge and terrace atoms of NCs. Through the comparison of the catalytic behaviors of edge&#8208;covered Pd NCs, which were prepared by the selective deposition of catalytically inactive Au atoms onto the edge sites of rhombic dodecahedral (RD) Pd NCs, with those of the pristine RD Pd NCs toward alkyne hydrogenation and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions, we could decouple the activity of the edge and {110}&#8208;plane atoms of the Pd NCs without uncertainties. We expect that this study will provide an opportunity to scrutinize the surface properties of various NC catalysts to a more precise level and devise ideal catalysts for intended catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlative Electrochemical Microscopy for the Elucidation of the Local Ionic and Electronic Properties of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a key role in the stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries as the SEI prevents the continuous degradation of the electrolyte at the anode. The SEI acts as an insu&#173;lating layer for electron transfer, still allowing the ionic flux through the layer. We combine the feedback and multi&#8208;frequency alternating&#8208;current modes of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for the first time to assess quantitatively the local electronic and ionic properties of the SEI varying the SEI formation conditions and the used electrolytes in the field of Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIB). Correlations between the electronic and ionic properties of the resulting SEI on a model Cu electrode demonstrates the unique feasibility of the proposed strategy to provide the two essential properties of an SEI: ionic and electronic conductivity in dependence on the formation conditions, which is anticipated to exhibit a significant impact on the field of LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks via Asymmetric Organocatalysis for Heterogeneous Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general and efficient organocatalytic asymmetric polymerization approach for synthesis of the chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) has been developed. With chiral 2&#8208;methylpyrrolidine catalyst, a series of tris(N&#8208;salicylideneamine)&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;CCOFs are directly constructed from prochiral aldehyde&#8208; and primary amine&#8208;monomers. The adopted aminocatalytic asymmetric Schiff&#8208;base condensation herein is performed under ambient conditions with clear green synthetic advantages over the conventional acid&#8208;catalysed solvothermal methods. The obtained &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;CCOFs can be further metalated by solid&#8208;state coordination approach, and the resulting Cu(II)@CCOFs can highly promote asymmetric A3&#8208;coupling reaction. Specifically, Cu(II)@CCOF@chitosan aerogel was fabricated as highly efficient fixed&#8208;bed model reactor for scaled&#8208;up catalysis. The concept of aminocatalytic asymmetric polymerization might open a new way for constructing the CCOFs via asymmetric organocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Photothermal Nanoconfinement Reactor: Boosting Chemical Reactivity with Locally High Temperature in a Confined Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a photothermal nanoconfinement reactor (PNCR) system is proposed and demonstrated by using hollow carbon nanospheres (HCN) to enhance the performance of chemical reaction. Under light irradiation, the local temperature of HCN inner void space was much higher than the bulk solution temperature because the confined space concentrates heat and inhibits heat loss. Using a temperature sensitive model reaction, peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation to oxidize micropollutant, it is shown that the degradation rate of sulfamethoxazole in the PNCR system was 7.1 times of those without nanoconfinement. It is further discovered that the high&#8208;quality local heat inside the nanoconfined space shifted the model reaction from an otherwise non&#8208;radical pathway to a radical&#8208;based pathway in the presence of the confinement. This work provides an interesting strategy to produce locally high temperature which has a wide range of applications to energy and environmental fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Dibenzodiazapyracylenes: Doubly N&#8208;Doped Cyclopenta&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Molecules That Exhibit High Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nitrogen&#8208;doped CP&#8208;PAH, dibenzodiazapyracylene, was successfully synthesized and characterized. The aromatic and antiaromatic resonance hybrid characters have been verified by comparing their 1H&#8197;NMR spectra to those of reference molecules. Their condensed packing structures in the solid state allowed for the effective hole transporting.







Abstract
Pyracylene is a unique cyclopenta&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) that exhibits dual aromatic characteristics. Herein we report the synthesis of doubly N&#8208;doped benzannulated pyracylenes, namely dibenzodiazapyracylenes, by oxidative N&#8722;N linking reaction of [2.2](2,5)pyrrolophane&#8208;type precursors. Dibenzodiazapyracylenes displayed well&#8208;ordered &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular packing in the solid state, which were feasible for effective hole&#8208;transporting along the stacking direction. High carrier mobility was estimated by microwave conductivity measurements as compared to dibenzoullazine. The high HOMO level of dibenzodiazapyracylene was verified by electrochemistry and its persistent radical cation species has been detected.

         <title>Regulation of High Miscibility for Efficient Charge&#8208;Transport in n&#8208;Doped Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High host&#8208;dopant miscibility and excellent carrier mobility can be simultaneously achieved in n&#8208;doped conjugated polymers. High&#8208;mobility polymers usually possess poor miscibility because of strong interchain interactions. Without harming the efficient charge&#8208;transport based on the ordered polymer backbones packing, disordered side&#8208;chains are introduced to accommodate dopants better without disturbing charge&#8208;transport pathways.







Abstract
Strong interchain interactions of conjugated polymers usually result in poor miscibility with molecular dopants, limiting the doping efficiency because of uncontrolled phase separation. We have developed a strategy to achieve efficient charge&#8208;transport and high doping miscibility in n&#8208;doped conjugated polymers. We solve the miscibility issue through disorder side&#8208;chains containing dopants better. Systemic structural characterization reveals a farther side&#8208;chain branching point will lead to higher disorders, which provides appropriate sites to accommodate extrinsic molecular dopants without harming original chain packings and charge&#8208;transport channels. Therefore, better sustainability of solid&#8208;state microstructure is obtained, yielding a stable conductivity even when overloading massive dopants. This work highlights the importance of realizing high host&#8208;dopant miscibility in molecular doping of conjugated polymers.

         <title>Record Aluminum Molecular Rings for Optical Limiting and Nonlinear Optics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic approach to generate the largest aluminum molecular rings is presented. Their nonlinear optics (NLO) and optical limiting (OL) performance is studied by the Z&#8208;scan technique. The results provide insights to understand the NLO structure&#8211;activity relationship and tune the NLO performance at a molecular level.







Abstract
Crystalline cluster materials, a class of functional motif aggregations, provide a great opportunity for tuning the properties stemming from the flexible and accurate variation of inorganic and organic compositions. In this study, we demonstrate the effects of functional ligand and ring size regulation on the structures and third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Revealed by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis results, aluminum molecular ring expansion is achieved by 2&#215;9 and 3&#215;6 strategies. In terms of the given organic shells, we further tuned the aluminum molecular ring sizes from 3.0&#8197;nm to 1.7&#8197;nm. The picosecond Z&#8208;scan measurements results revealed that the third&#8208;order NLO performances do not only depend on the general conjugate interactions but are also related to hydrogen bonding, polarizability, and ring sizes. The large nonlinear absorption coefficient and onset prove that the observed samples are promising candidates for the field of nonlinear optics.

         <title>A Universal Single&#8208;Atom Coating Strategy Based on Tannic Acid Chemistry for Multifunctional Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the tannic acid coating method, a series of mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic single&#8208;atom coatings (SACs) (e.&#8201;g., Co, Fe, Mn, Co&#8722;Mn, Fe&#8722;Mn) can be formed on substrates of different materials (e.&#8201;g., carbon black, carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon cloth, SiO2, TiO2, ZnO, MoS2), dimensions (0D&#8211;3D) and sizes (50&#8197;nm&#8211;5&#8197;cm).







Abstract
Here, we report a universal single&#8208;atom coating (SAC) strategy by taking advantage of the rich chemistry of tannic acid (TA). TA units not only self&#8208;assemble into a cross&#8208;linked porous polyphenolic framework, but also can grip on different substates via multiple binding modes. Benefiting from the diverse chelating ability of TA, a series of mono&#8208;, and bi&#8208;metallic SACs can be formed on substrates of different materials (e.&#8201;g., carbon, SiO2, TiO2, MoS2), dimensions (0D&#8211;3D) and sizes (50&#8197;nm&#8211;5&#8197;cm). By contrast, uniform SAC cannot be achieved using common approaches such as pyrolysis of metal&#8211;dopamine complexes or metal&#8211;organic frameworks. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, two Co SACs immobilized on graphene and TiO2 were prepared. The former one shows six&#8208;fold higher mass activity than Pt/C toward oxygen reduction. The latter one displays outstanding photocatalytic activity owing to the high activity of the single atoms and the formation of the single&#8208;atom coating&#8211;TiO2 heterojunction.

         <title>Flexible Soft&#8208;Solid Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composite Membranes for H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel flexible soft&#8208;solid MOF composite membranes were developed on commercial polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) substrates. The quasi&#8208;vertically oriented, solid Zn2(benzimidazolate)4 particles grown on the PVDF substrate provided predominant molecular sieving gas entrances, while the soft polyamide eliminated defects enclosing MOF particles, resulting in a superior H2/CO2 separation factor which far exceeded those of MOF&#8208;based membranes reported to date.







Abstract
The development of a facile strategy to construct defect&#8208;free and flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based membranes with high selectivity and good scalability holds great appeal. Here we report the fabrication of soft&#8208;solid MOF composite membranes on polyvinylidene fluoride substrates. A representative membrane comprised of quasi&#8208;vertically grown lamellar Zn2(Bim)4 (Bim=benzimidazolate) and lateral ultrathin polyamide film adhering to the MOF side facets. The straight interlayer galleries within unwrapped Zn2(Bim)4 acted as predominant pathways, while the polyamide served the function of defect elimination, synergistically inducing an unprecedented H2/CO2 selectivity of 1084 which set a new record for MOF&#8208;based membranes. Separation performance was held constant after membrane rolling up into a tube with a diameter of 3&#8197;mm or folding and unfolding at 90&#176; for 50 times. ZIF&#8208;67 and ZIF&#8208;8 composite membranes based on this strategy also realized extremely high H2/CO2 separation accuracies. These results, which demonstrate the intrinsic molecular sieving capability of MOFs, will promote the development of MOF&#8208;based membranes in practical separation applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Metal Electrodeposition Revealed by In Situ Optical Imaging and Theoretical Modeling towards Fast&#8208;Charging Zn Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast metal electrodeposition in fast&#8208;charging Zn batteries was investigated by in situ optical imaging and theoretical modeling. The critical parameters governing the electrodeposition stability of the metallic Zn electrode were uncovered, guided by which a highly reversible Zn metal electrode in an aqueous battery with a depth of discharge of 66.7&#8201;% at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved.







Abstract
Metallic Zn is a preferred anode material for rechargeable aqueous batteries towards a smart grid and renewable energy storage. Understanding how the metal nucleates and grows at the aqueous Zn anode is a critical and challenging step to achieve full reversibility of Zn battery chemistry, especially under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Here, by combining in situ optical imaging and theoretical modeling, we uncover the critical parameters governing the electrodeposition stability of the metallic Zn electrode, that is, the competition among crystallographic thermodynamics, kinetics, and Zn2+&#8208;ion diffusion. Moreover, steady&#8208;state Zn metal plating/stripping with Coulombic efficiency above 99&#8201;% is achieved at 10&#8211;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a reasonably high concentration (3&#8197;M) ZnSO4 electrolyte. Significantly, a long&#8208;term cycling&#8208;stable Zn metal electrode is realized with a depth of discharge of 66.7&#8201;% under 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in both Zn||Zn symmetrical cells and MnO2||Zn full cells.

Multifunctional microrobots, made of Ni@Pt microrockets, CdS quantum dots, and a host &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin selector, have been engineered that simultaneously exhibit i) self&#8208;propulsion, ii)&#8197;fluorescence, and iii)&#8197;magnetic properties in combination with iv) supramolecular chiral recognition for &#8220;enantiorecognition&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; approaches. As a model chiral target, tryptophan enantiomers have been discriminated using a bimodal (optical and electrical) readout.







Abstract
Herein, a general procedure for the synthesis of multifunctional MRs, which simultaneously exhibit i) chiral, ii)&#8197;magnetic, and iii)&#8197;fluorescent properties in combination with iv) self&#8208;propulsion, is reported. Self&#8208;propelled Ni@Pt superparamagnetic microrockets have been functionalized with fluorescent CdS quantum dots carrying a chiral host biomolecule as &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD). The &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; chiral recognition potential of MRs has been interrogated by taking advantage of the &#946;&#8208;CD affinity to supramolecularly accommodate different chiral biomolecules (i.e., amino acids). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, tryptophan enantiomers have been discriminated with a dual&#8208;mode (optical and electrochemical) readout. This approach paves the way to devise intelligent cargo micromachines with &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8221; chiral supramolecular recognition capabilities to elucidate the concept of &#8220;enantiorecognition&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221;, which might be facilely customized by tailoring the supramolecular host&#8211;guest encapsulation.

         <title>Highly Efficient Asymmetric Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with EQE of 32.8&#8201;% and Extremely Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using asymmetric peripheral protection as a design motif, two high efficiency and fast reverse intersystem crossing rate multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials were designed and synthesized. The corresponding device exhibits pure green emission with a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 32.8&#8201;% and relatively low efficiency roll&#8208;off without utilizing any sensitizer.







Abstract
Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters show great potentials for high color purity organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the simultaneous realization of high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and high reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) is still a formidable challenge. Herein, a novel asymmetric MR&#8208;TADF emitter (2Cz&#8208;PTZ&#8208;BN) is designed that fully inherits the high PLQY and large kRISC values of the properly selected parent molecules. The resonating extended &#960;&#8208;skeleton with peripheral protection can achieve a high PLQY of 96&#8201;% and a fast kRISC of above 1.0&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, and boost the performance of corresponding pure green devices with an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 32.8&#8201;% without utilizing any sensitizing hosts. Remarkably, the device sufficiently maintains a high EQE exceeding 23&#8201;% at a high luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, representing the highest value for reported green MR&#8208;TADF materials at the same luminescence.

         <title>A Descriptor for Accurate Predictions of Host Molecules Enabling Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Guest Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A descriptor &#916;E was developed based on the intersystem crossing via higher excited states (ISCHES) mechanism, allowing accurate predictions of organic host&#8211;guest phosphorescent systems.







Abstract
Although doping can induce room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in heavy&#8208;atom free organic systems, it is often challenging to match the host and guest components to achieve efficient intersystem crossing for activating RTP. In this work, we developed a simple descriptor &#916;E to predict host molecules for matching the guest RTP emitters, based on the intersystem crossing via higher excited states (ISCHES) mechanism. This descriptor successfully predicted five commercially available host components to pair with naphthalimide (NA) and naphtho[2,3&#8208;c]furan&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione (2,3&#8208;NA) emitters with a high accuracy of 83&#8201;%. The yielded pairs exhibited bright yellow and green RTP with the quantum efficiency up to 0.4 and lifetime up to 1.67&#8197;s, respectively. Using these RTP pairs, we successfully achieved multi&#8208;layer message encryption. The &#916;E descriptor could provide an efficient way for developing doping&#8208;induced RTP materials.

         <title>Structure Elucidation and Computationally Guided Synthesis of SSZ&#8208;43: A One&#8208;Dimensional 12&#8208;Ring Zeolite with Unique Sinusoidal Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
After two decades since its discovery, the structure of zeolite SSZ&#8208;43 has been determined as a novel framework comprised of a primitive orthorhombic crystal system with monoclinic faulting that forms unique, 1D 12&#8208;ring sinusoidal channels. A combination of molecular modeling and empirical relationships for zeolite selectivity was used to design two new di&#8208;quaternary OSDAs and produce SSZ&#8208;43 across a wide range of high SiO2 compositions.







Abstract
The structure of zeolite SSZ&#8208;43 was determined by 3D electron diffraction, synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. The SSZ&#8208;43 framework forms one&#8208;dimensional, sinusoidal 12&#8208;ring channels from 5461 butterfly units commonly found in other zeolites, but with unique 6.5&#215;6.5&#8197;&#197; apertures and 12&#8208;ring 6.5&#215;8.9&#8197;&#197; windows perpendicular to the channels. SSZ&#8208;43 crystals are intergrowths of two polytypes: &#8776;90&#8201;% orthorhombic polytype A with ABAB stacking of the 12&#8208;rings, and &#8776;10&#8201;% monoclinic polytype B with ABCABC stacking. Molecular modeling performed on the idealized Si&#8208;SSZ&#8208;43 structure along with empirical relationships for zeolite selectivity in boron&#8208; and aluminum&#8208;containing synthesis gels were used in a combined approach to design new di&#8208;quaternary ammonium organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDAs). Experimental trials demonstrated that the new OSDAs produced SSZ&#8208;43 over a broader range of compositions than previous mono&#8208;quaternary OSDAs.

         <title>Peptoid&#8208;Directed Formation of Five&#8208;Fold Twinned Au Nanostars through Particle Attachment and Facet Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantage of the easy manipulation of peptoid&#8211;peptoid and peptoid&#8211;particle interactions solely by the variation of side chain chemistry, peptoid&#8208;induced formation of five&#8208;fold twinned Au star&#8208;shaped particles exhibiting five regular points has been achieved through a process of repeated particle attachment followed by facet stabilization.







Abstract
While bio&#8208;inspired synthesis offers great potential for controlling nucleation and growth of inorganic particles, precisely tuning biomolecule&#8211;particle interactions is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we used variations in peptoid sequence to manipulate peptoid&#8211;Au interactions, leading to the synthesis of concave five&#8208;fold twinned, five&#8208;pointed Au nanostars via a process of repeated particle attachment and facet stabilization. Ex situ and liquid&#8208;phase TEM observations show that a balance between particle attachment biased to occur near the star points, preferential growth along the [100] direction, and stabilization of (111) facets is critical to forming star&#8208;shaped particles. Molecular simulations predict that interaction strengths between peptoids and distinct Au facets differ significantly and thus can alter attachment kinetics and surface energies to form the stars. This work provides new insights into how sequence&#8208;defined ligands affect particle growth to regulate crystal morphology.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While bio-inspired synthesis offers great potential for controlling nucleation and growth of inorganic particles, precisely tuning biomolecule&#8211;particle interactions is a long-standing challenge. Herein, we used variations in peptoid sequence to manipulate peptoid&#8211;Au interactions, leading to the synthesis of concave five-fold twinned, five-pointed Au nanostars &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a process of repeated particle attachment and facet stabilization. &lt;i&gt;Ex situ&lt;/i&gt; and liquid-phase TEM observations show that a balance between particle attachment biased to occur near the star points, preferential growth along the [100] direction, and stabilization of (111) facets is critical to forming star-shaped particles. Molecular simulations predict that interaction strengths between peptoids and distinct Au facets differ significantly and thus can alter attachment kinetics and surface energies to form the stars. This work provides new insights into how sequence-defined ligands affect particle growth to regulate crystal morphology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Hydrocobaltation and Borylcobaltation Enable Regioselective Migratory Triborylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed triborylation of unactivated alkenes is developed to access synthetically versatile 1,1,3&#8208;triborylalkanes with a catalyst generated from Co(acac)2 and xantphos. Mechanistic studies reveal that this triborylation reaction proceeds through three interdependent catalytic cycles.







Abstract
The structural diversity of sp3&#8208;triorganometallic reagents enhances their potentiality in the modular construction of molecular complexity in chemical synthesis. Despite significant achievements on the preparation of sp3 1,1,1&#8208; and 1,1,2&#8208;triorganometallic B,B,B&#8208;reagents, catalytic approaches that enable the installation of multiple boryl groups at skipped carbons of unactivated alkenes still remain elusive. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed selective triborylation reaction of unactivated alkenes to access synthetically versatile 1,1,3&#8208;triborylalkanes. This triborylation protocol provides a general platform for regioselective trifunctionalization of unactivated alkenes, and its utility is highlighted by the synthesis of various value&#8208;added chemicals from readily accessible unactivated alkenes. Mechanistic studies, including deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments and evaluation of potential reactive intermediates, provide insight into the experimentally observed chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalysed Dissolution of Elemental Gold in Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold can be dissolved in a sustainable manner with common household chemicals: iodine solution in ethanol, resembling diluted iodine tincture, green oxidant hydrogen peroxide and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole, a compound used in medicinal applications. Catalytic reactions and green solvents are the basis for sustainable development and recycling of precious metals like gold.







Abstract
Gold is a scarce element in the Earth's crust but indispensable in modern electronic devices. New, sustainable methods of gold recycling are essential to meet the growing eco&#8208;social demand of gold. Here, we describe a simple, inexpensive, and environmentally benign dissolution of gold under mild conditions. Gold dissolves quantitatively in ethanol using 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole as a ligand in the presence of a catalytic amount of iodine. Mechanistically, the dissolution of gold begins when I2 oxidizes Au0 and forms a [AuII2]&#8722; species, which undergoes subsequent ligand&#8208;exchange reactions and forms a stable bis&#8208;ligand AuI complex. H2O2 oxidizes free iodide and regenerated I2 returns back to the catalytic cycle. Addition of a reductant to the reaction mixture precipitates gold quantitatively and partially regenerates the ligand. We anticipate our work will open a new pathway to more sustainable metal recycling with the utilization of just catalytic amounts of reagents and green solvents.

         <title>Modulating Built&#8208;In Electric Field via Variable Oxygen Affinity for Robust Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;support interaction between Pt and CoOx creates a strong built&#8208;in electric field across the interface and modulates the charge distribution. This electric field subtly optimizes both the hydrogen and hydroxide adsorption energy, boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction in neutral media.







Abstract
Work function strongly impacts the surficial charge distribution, especially for metal&#8208;support electrocatalysts when a built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) is constructed. Therefore, studying the correlation between work function and BEF is crucial for understanding the intrinsic reaction mechanism. Herein, we present a Pt@CoOx electrocatalyst with a large work function difference (&#916;&#934;) and strong BEF, which shows outstanding hydrogen evolution activity in a neutral medium with a 4.5&#8208;fold mass activity higher than 20&#8201;% Pt/C. Both experimental and theoretical results confirm the interfacial charge redistribution induced by the strong BEF, thus subtly optimizing hydrogen and hydroxide adsorption energy. This work not only provides fresh insights into the neutral hydrogen evolution mechanism but also proposes new design principles toward efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production in a neutral medium.

         <title>Main&#8208;Chain Fluoropolymers with Alternating Sequence Control via Light&#8208;Driven Reversible&#8208;Deactivation Copolymerization in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;enabled controlled copolymerization compatible with both batch and flow syntheses has been established for the transformation of chlorotrifluoroethylene and vinyl esters/amides. This work enables on&#8208;demand preparation of main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers with various fractions of alternating units under ambient conditions, and streamlines the generation of block copolymers from gaseous fluoroethylene using two&#8208;step photo&#8208;flow systems.







Abstract
Polymers with regulated alternating structures are attractive in practical applications, particularly for main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers. We for the first time enabled controlled fluoropolymer synthesis with alternating sequence regulation using a novel fluorinated xanthate agent via a light&#8208;driven process, which achieved on&#8208;demand copolymerization of chlorotrifluoroethylene and vinyl esters/amides under both batch and flow conditions at ambient pressure. This method creates a facile access to fluoropolymers with a broad fraction range of alternating units, low dispersities and high chain&#8208;end fidelity. Moreover, a two&#8208;step photo&#8208;flow platform was established to streamline the in&#8208;situ chain&#8208;extension toward unprecedented block copolymers continuously from fluoroethylene. Influences of structural control were illustrated with thermal and surface properties. We anticipate that this work will promote advanced material engineering with customized fluoropolymers.

         <title>Millisecond&#8208;Range Time&#8208;Resolved Bioimaging Enabled through Ultralong Aqueous Phosphorescence Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pioneering example of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved bioimaging is illustrated, which is enabled through ultralong aqueous phosphorescence probes.







Abstract
Probes featuring room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are promising tools for time&#8208;resolved imaging. It is worth noting that the time scale of time&#8208;resolved bioimaging generally ranges around the microsecond level, because of the short&#8208;lived emission. Herein, the first example of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved bioimaging is illustrated, which is enabled through a kind of ultralong aqueous phosphorescence probes (i.e., cyclo&#8208;(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;AspD&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Cys)&#8208;conjugated zinc&#8208;doped silica nanospheres), with a RTP emission lasting for &#8776;5&#8197;s and a lifetime as long as 743.7&#8197;ms. We demonstrate that live cells and deep tumor tissue in mice can be specifically targeted through immune&#8208;phosphorescence imaging, with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) value of &#8776;69 for in vitro imaging, and &#8776;627 for in vivo imaging, respectively. We further show that, compared to that of fluorescence imaging, the SBR enhancement of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved in vivo bioimaging is up to 105&#8197;times.

     alt="Millisecond-Range Time-Resolved Bioimaging Enabled through Ultralong Aqueous Phosphorescence Probes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pioneering example of millisecond-range time-resolved bioimaging is illustrated, which is enabled through ultralong aqueous phosphorescence probes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probes featuring room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are promising tools for time-resolved imaging. It is worth noting that the time scale of time-resolved bioimaging generally ranges around the microsecond level, because of the short-lived emission. Herein, the first example of millisecond-range time-resolved bioimaging is illustrated, which is enabled through a kind of ultralong aqueous phosphorescence probes (i.e., cyclo-(Arg-Gly-AspD-Tyr-Cys)-conjugated zinc-doped silica nanospheres), with a RTP emission lasting for &#8776;5&#8197;s and a lifetime as long as 743.7&#8197;ms. We demonstrate that live cells and deep tumor tissue in mice can be specifically targeted through immune-phosphorescence imaging, with a high signal-to-background ratio (SBR) value of &#8776;69 for in vitro imaging, and &#8776;627 for in vivo imaging, respectively. We further show that, compared to that of fluorescence imaging, the SBR enhancement of millisecond-range time-resolved in vivo bioimaging is up to 105&#8197;times.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Fluorescence Imaging of Cancer Cells Based on ROS&#8208;Triggered Intracellular Cross&#8208;Linking of Artificial Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial enzyme that responds to intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was designed through introducing a catalytic histidine residue at one of the thiols of pentaerythritol tetra(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate). The artificial enzyme could in&#8197;situ cross&#8208;link to form an assembled structure that could trigger the cleavage of the ester bond of pro&#8208;fluorophore and activate the turn&#8208;on fluorescence inside cancer cells for selective diagnosis.







Abstract
Inside living cells, regulation of catalytic activity of artificial enzymes remains challenging due to issues such as biocompatibility, efficiency, and stability of the catalyst, by which the practical applications of artificial enzymes have been severely hindered. Here, an artificial enzyme, PTT&#8208;SGH, with responsiveness to reactive oxygen species (ROS), was obtained by introducing a catalytic histidine residue to pentaerythritol tetra(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate) (PTT). The artificial enzyme formed large aggregates in cells via the intracellular ROS&#8208;mediated oxidation of thiol groups. The process was significantly facilitated in tumor cells because of the higher ROS concentration in the tumor microenvironment. The catalytic activity of this artificial enzyme was intensively enhanced through deprotonation of cross&#8208;linked PTT&#8208;SGH, which showed typical esterase activities. Selective fluorescence imaging of tumor cells was achieved using the artificial enzyme to trigger the cleavage of the ester bond of the caged fluorophore inside living cells.

         <title>Accelerated Mechanochemistry in Helical Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
When polymer chains are stressed in solution, mechanochemistry is accelerated if helical conformations are present in the chain, as measured using a combination of size&#8208;exclusion chromatography and the use of rhodamine mechanophore activation. This phenomenon is explained by the increased persistence length in helical polymers, leading to more efficient energy transduction.







Abstract
Polymer chains, if long enough, are known to undergo bond scission when mechanically stressed. While the mechanochemical response of random coils is well understood, biopolymers and some key synthetic chains adopt well&#8208;defined secondary structures such as helices. To understand covalent mechanochemistry in such structures, poly(&#947;&#8208;benzyl glutamates) are prepared while regulating the feed&#8208;monomer chirality, producing chains with similar molecular weights and backbone chemistry but different helicities. Such chains are stressed in solution and their mechanochemistry rates compared by following molecular weight change and using a rhodamine mechanochromophore. Results reveal that while helicity itself is not affected by the covalent bond scissions, chains with higher helicity undergo faster mechanochemistry. Considering that the polymers tested differ only in conformation, these results indicate that helix&#8208;induced chain rigidity improves the efficiency of mechanical energy transduction.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Embedded Multi&#8208;Resonance Heteroaromatics with Prolonged Homogeneous Hexatomic Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red multi&#8208;resonance emitters with high photoluminescence quantum yields and narrowband emission were demonstrated by introducing homogeneous hexatomic rings into nitrogen&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The resulting devices afforded state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with external quantum efficiency up to 18.2&#8201;% and superior operation stability.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic heteroaromatics have exhibited fascinating multi&#8208;resonance (MR) characteristics for efficient narrowband emission, but strategies to bathochromic shift their emissions while maintaining the narrow bandwidths remain exclusive. Here, homogeneous hexatomic rings are introduced into nitrogen&#8208;embedded MR skeletons to prolong the &#960;&#8208;conjugation length for low&#8208;energy electronic transitions while retaining the non&#8208;bonding character of the remaining parts. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept emitters exhibit near unity photoluminescence quantum yields with peaks at 598&#8197;nm and 620&#8197;nm and small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximums of 28&#8197;nm and 31&#8197;nm, respectively. Optimal organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit a high external quantum efficiency of 18.2&#8201;%, negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off, and ultra&#8208;long lifetime with negligible degradation at an initial luminance of 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 after 94&#8197;hours.

         <title>Microfluidics&#8208;Assisted Engineering of pH/Enzyme Dual&#8208;Activatable ZIF@Polymer Nanosystem for Co&#8208;Delivery of Proteins and Chemotherapeutics with Enhanced Deep&#8208;Tumor Penetration</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel pH/enzyme dual&#8208;activatable nanoplatform (ZIF@DG) was developed via in&#8197;situ encapsulation of therapeutics into a zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF&#8208;8, combined with microfluidics&#8208;assisted preparation of a DG polymer coating. The nanoplatform can co&#8208;deliver the protein drug ribonuclease A and the small&#8208;molecule drug doxorubicin with controlled drug release to deep tumor regions for synergistic cancer therapy.







Abstract
The impermeable barriers of solid tumors restrict the co&#8208;delivery of protein&#8208;based drugs and chemotherapeutics for cancer treatment. Therefore, we developed a ZIF&#8208;DOX/RA@DG nanosystem that encapsulates ribonuclease A (RA) and doxorubicin (DOX) in a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) core, with a dextran&#8208;based coating (DG). The nanosystem exhibits dual&#8208;responsiveness due to &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase&#8208;activatable cationization and acidic microenvironment&#8208;triggered degradation. The DG&#8208;coating process was achieved using a microfluidic approach, which stabilized the polymer responsiveness, ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based structure, and bioactivity of the encapsulated therapeutics. In&#8197;vivo results confirmed that the nanosystem could co&#8208;deliver RA and DOX to deep impermeable lesions with a synergistic anticancer therapeutic effects. Such a multi&#8208;drug delivery system based on an intelligent&#8208;responsive design and a microfluidics&#8208;assisted synthesis strategy shows great clinical prospects.

         <title>Hypoxia&#8208;Responsive Platinum Supernanoparticles for Urinary Microfluidic Monitoring of Tumors</title>

Hypoxia&#8208;triggered platinum supernanoparticles dissociated into ultrasmall platinum nanoclusters, which could be cleared by the kidney through urine, in response to the tumor microenvironment. After collection of the excreted nanosensors, the disease status was monitored visually and quantitatively by using a microfluidic chip.







Abstract
Cancer has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and there is an increasing need for versatile tools to enable sensitive, simple and early cancer monitoring. Here, we report platinum supernanoparticles as an exogenous nanosensor which can dissociate into ultrasmall platinum nanoclusters (PtNCs) under tumor&#8208;specific hypoxia conditions. The resulting PtNCs can be filtered through the kidney as urinary reporters to be quantified by a companion volumetric bar&#8208;chart chip (V&#8208;Chip) for point&#8208;of&#8208;care analysis. The V&#8208;Chip signals of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and its lung metastasis mouse model showed a significant increase compared to healthy mice. Our nanosensor can also noninvasively monitor the course of treatment, which is significant for screening tumor recurrence and individualized evaluation of pharmacological and follow&#8208;up efficacy. Importantly, this strategy could be adapted for various diseases to form a common diagnostic platform by changing responsive linkers.

         <title>Single&#8208;Vesicle Electrochemistry Reveals Sex Difference in Vesicular Storage and Release of Catecholamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical quantitative measurements of vesicle chemistry (i.e., chemical storage and release) at the single&#8208;vesicle level reveal a sex difference in transmitter release during exocytosis, which might relate to the sex difference of the expression level of voltage&#8208;dependent calcium channels and membrane lipid composition. This research provides a new perspective to understand sex dimorphism in exocytosis.







Abstract
Quantitative measurements of sex difference in vesicle chemistry (i.e., chemical storage and release) at the single&#8208;vesicle level are essential to understand sex differences in cognitive behaviors; however, such measurements are very challenging to conventional analytical methods. By using single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry, we find the duration of single exocytotic events of chromaffin cells prepared from male rats is statistically longer than that from female rats, leading to more neurotransmitter released in the male group. Further analysis reveals that a higher percentage of vesicles in the female group release part of the neurotransmitter, i.e., partial release, during exocytosis than that in male group. This sex dimorphism in neurotransmitter release in exocytosis might relate to the sex difference in the expression of voltage&#8208;dependent calcium channels and membrane lipid composition. Our finding offers the first experimental evidence that sex dimorphism even exists in vesicle chemistry, providing a brand new viewpoint for understanding the sex dimorphism in exocytosis.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Biodegradable Nanoagents Based on Lanthanide Nucleotide Self&#8208;Assemblies toward Precise Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled lanthanide nucleotide nanoparticles (LNNPs) with tunable size (4.6&#8211;105.7&#8197;nm) are developed by employing nanomicelles as a template. High&#8208;resolution spectra at 10&#8197;K are provided for the first time to unravel the local site symmetry of Ln3+ inside the LNNPs. The ultrasmall DOX@LNNPs can achieve rapid renal clearance and unique tumor accumulation, thus enabling efficient tumor&#8208;specific therapy with negligible long&#8208;term toxicity.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoagents, which simultaneously satisfy normal tissue clearance and tumor&#8208;specific responsive treatment, are highly attractive for precise cancer theranostics. Herein, we develop a unique template&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy for the exquisitely controlled synthesis of self&#8208;assembled lanthanide (Ln3+) nucleotide nanoparticles (LNNPs) with amorphous structure and tunable size from sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm to 105&#8197;nm. By virtue of the low&#8208;temperature (10&#8197;K) and high&#8208;resolution spectroscopy, the local site symmetry of Ln3+ in LNNPs is unraveled for the first time. The proposed LNNPs are further demonstrated to possess the ability for highly efficient loading and tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive release of doxorubicin. Particularly, sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm LNNPs not only exhibit excellent biocompatibility and predominant renal&#8208;clearance performance, but also enable efficient tumor retention. These findings reveal the great potential of LNNPs as a new generation of therapeutic platform to overcome the dilemma between efficient therapy and long&#8208;term toxicity of nanoagents for future clinical applications.

         <title>Inorganic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Membrane Based on Pillararene&#8208;Intercalated MXene Nanosheets for Efficient Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to prepare a series of inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid nanosheets based on pillararene&#8208;intercalated MXene nanosheets is reported, which have larger lateral size compared with the original MXene nanosheets, in which a membrane was formed through vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration. The as&#8208;prepared membranes exhibited relatively high water permeance, rejection, and stability for treating water containing antibiotics under dead&#8208;end filtration and cross&#8208;flow filtration conditions.







Abstract
Discharge of antibiotic&#8208;containing wastewater causes environmental pollution and threatens biological and human health. An efficient treatment method for this wastewater is urgently required. We prepared inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid MXene&#8211;pillararene nanosheets with a large lateral size (5&#8211;8&#8197;&#956;m). The hybrid nanosheets were stacked on supports via vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration to prepare membranes with regular parallel slits and an interlayer spacing of 1.36&#8197;nm, which were used to purify antibiotic&#8208;containing water. Permeance through the membrane increased 100&#8208;fold compared with most polymeric and other two&#8208;dimensional nanofiltration membranes with similar rejection. This high permeance and rejection was attributed to the large lateral size of the nanosheets, regular interlayer spacing, and electrostatic interaction between the membrane and antibiotics. These membranes will broaden the applications of lamellar materials for the separation of high&#8208;value&#8208;added drugs in academia and industry.

         <title>Dual Active Centers Bridged by Oxygen Vacancies of Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Hybrids Supported on Molybdenum Oxide for Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;SA (single atom)/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids with abundant Mon+ species neighboring oxygen vacancies are synthesized via a H&#8208;spillover process. More importantly, Ru&#8208;SA/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids can quantitatively produce NH3 from N2 and H2 by the effect of dual active centers (Ru SA and Mon+).







Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of ammonia (NH3) holds significant potential compared with the Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, the reported photocatalysts suffer from low efficiency owing to localized electron deficiency. Herein, Ru&#8208;SA (single atoms)/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids with abundant of Mon+ (4&lt;n&lt;6) species neighboring oxygen vacancies (OV) are synthesized via a H&#8208;spillover process. Detailed characterizations demonstrate that Ru&#8208;SA/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids can quantitatively produce NH3 from N2 and H2 through the presence of dual active centers (Ru SA and Mon+). The Ru SA boost the activation and migration of H2, and Mon+ species act as the trapping sites of localized electrons and the adsorption and dissociation sites of N2, finally leading to NH3 synthesis on Mon+&#8722;OH. The NH3 generation rate is up to 4.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, accompanied by an apparent quantum efficiency over 6.0&#8201;% at 650&#8197;nm.

   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; species act as the trapping sites of localized electrons and the adsorption and dissociation sites of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, finally leading to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis on Mo&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;OH. The NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; generation rate is up to 4.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, accompanied by an apparent quantum efficiency over 6.0&#8201;% at 650&#8197;nm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Ca&#8208;ion battery: Ascribed to the improved anion intercalation performance in the graphite cathode and reversible Ca2+ insertion in the organic anode, by combining a 3.5&#8197;m concentrated Ca&#8208;ion electrolyte with the low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly graphite cathode and organic anode, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Ca&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery exhibits 75.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 specific discharge capacity and 84.7&#8201;% capacity retention over 350&#8197;cycles, among the best results for Ca&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Due to the large abundance, low redox potential, and multivalent properties of calcium (Ca), Ca&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) show promising prospects for energy storage applications. However, current research on CIBs faces the challenges of unsatisfactory cycling stability and capacity, mainly restricted by the lack of suitable electrolytes and electrode materials. Herein, we firstly developed a 3.5&#8197;m concentrated electrolyte with a calcium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Ca(FSI)2) salt dissolved in carbonate solvents. This electrolyte significantly improved the intercalation capacity for anions in the graphite cathode and contributed to the reversible insertion of Ca2+ in the organic anode. By combining this concentrated electrolyte with the low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly graphite cathode and organic anode, the assembled Ca&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery (Ca&#8208;DIB) exhibits 75.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 specific discharge capacity at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 84.7&#8201;% capacity retention over 350&#8197;cycles, among the best results known for CIBs.

         <title>Superlattice in a Ru Superstructure for Enhancing Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile wet&#8208;chemical method for synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional Ru multilayered nanosheets with a superlattice is reported and the significance of the superlattice on electrocatalysis is demonstrated. Theoretical calculations reveal that the superlattice between the adjacent Ru layers can induce the strain effect, which leads to the lattice contraction and the weakening of the *H adsorption ability, as a result of improved HER performance.







Abstract
Superlattices are attracting extensive attention due to their unique properties. Nevertheless, the observations of superlattices are limited to those layered structures with weak interlayered interactions, and the effect of the superlattice in metal&#8208;based nanostructures on catalysis is unexplored yet. We here report a facile wet&#8208;chemical method for synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional Ru multilayered nanosheets (Ru MNSs) with a superlattice. Characterizations reveal that the superlattice is formed by stacking Ru layers with twisted angles from 2&#176; to 30&#176;. Owing to the strong synergy between the adjacent layers, Ru MNSs can serve as an efficient catalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Theoretical calculations reveal that the superlattice can induce the strain effect, which leads to lattice contraction and weak *H adsorption ability, as a result of improved HER performance. This work sheds new light on the utilization of the superlattice on enhancing catalysis in metal&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Depositing Molecular Graphene Nanoribbons on Ag(111) by Electrospray Controlled Ion Beam Deposition: Self&#8208;Assembly and On&#8208;Surface Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped molecular graphene nanoribbons, deposited by electrospray controlled ion beam deposition, form extended, metal&#8211;organic coordination polymers after multiple chemical transformations employing on&#8208;surface synthesis protocols. These transformations and the nature of the metal&#8211;organic coordination motifs are investigated by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy.







Abstract
The chemical processing of low&#8208;dimensional carbon nanostructures is crucial for their integration in future devices. Here we apply a new methodology in atomically precise engineering by combining multistep solution synthesis of N&#8208;doped molecular graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with mass&#8208;selected ultra&#8208;high vacuum electrospray controlled ion beam deposition on surfaces and real&#8208;space visualisation by scanning tunnelling microscopy. We demonstrate how this method yields solely a controllable amount of single, otherwise unsublimable, GNRs of 2.9&#8197;nm length on a planar Ag(111) surface. This methodology allows for further processing by employing on&#8208;surface synthesis protocols and exploiting the reactivity of the substrate. Following multiple chemical transformations, the GNRs provide reactive building blocks to form extended, metal&#8211;organic coordination polymers.

         <title>Tailoring a Near&#8208;Infrared Macrocyclization Scaffold Allows the Control of In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly for Photoacoustic/PET Bimodal Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared triazole&#8208;IR780 fluorophore was tailored as a PAI&#8208;active macrocyclization scaffold for controlling macrocyclization and in situ self&#8208;assembly, which enabled the development of a caspase&#8208;3&#8208;activatable PET/PAI bimodal probe [18F]&#8208;IR780&#8208;1 for noninvasive imaging of drug&#8208;induced tumor apoptosis in vivo, with potential for the early monitoring of tumor response to chemotherapy.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;triggered macrocyclization and in situ self&#8208;assembly of small molecules into nanoparticles has shown promise to design activatable probes for molecular imaging. However, controlling macrocyclization and self&#8208;assembly to concurrently augment positron emission tomography (PET) and photoacoustic (PA) signals for bimodality imaging is challenging. Herein, we report the engineering of a triazole&#8208;IR780 fluorophore as a versatile macrocyclization scaffold for controlling in situ self&#8208;assembly and design a caspase&#8208;3&#8208;activatable PA/PET bimodal probe ([18F]&#8208;IR780&#8208;1) for in vivo imaging of tumor apoptosis. By leveraging the high&#8208;sensitivity whole&#8208;body imaging signals offered by PET with the high&#8208;resolution imaging signals offered by PA, [18F]&#8208;IR780&#8208;1 can provide a promising tool for the early evaluation of antitumor efficacy, helpful for optimizing the therapeutic protocol for patients. This scaffold may be adopted to design other activatable bimodal probes for in vivo imaging.

         <title>Molecular and Spin Structures of a Through&#8208;Space Conjugated Triradical System</title>

         <dc:description>
The formally equilateral triradical with D3h symmetry is subject to Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion to create two distorted C2v structures (i.e., acute and obtuse forms) and these two distorted forms are reversibly interconverted in the solution and solid states.







Abstract
A through&#8208;space conjugated multi&#8208;phenalenyl triradical 1&#8201;a has been prepared and characterized. Partial occupancy of doubly degenerate molecular orbitals in 1&#8201;a leads to Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, creating a molecular skeleton in which C2v doublet states are lower in energy than undistorted D3h doublet and quartet states. Triradical 1&#8201;a exists in an acute form in the solution state, whereas it adopts a preferred obtuse form in the solid state. The results of the investigation show that these two distorted forms are reversibly interconverted by thermal energy.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Silylcyanation of Ynamides: Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Access to Tetrasubstituted 3&#8208;Silyl&#8208;2&#8208;Aminoacrylonitriles</title>

         <dc:description>
Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles (&#945;&#8208;enaminonitriles) are underinvestigated building blocks due to the lack of methodologies to synthesize them in a controlled manner. A general access to these valuable scaffolds accompanied by mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations is described. This highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective strategy relies on the use of the first intermolecular silylcyanation of ynamides.







Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed silylcyanation of ynamides is described. This reaction is fully regioselective, delivering tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles derivatives exclusively. Unexpectedly, the nature (aryl or alkyl) of the substituent located at the &#946;&#8208;position of the ynamide directly controls the stereoselectivity. The reaction tolerates a number of functional groups and can be considered as the first general access to fully substituted 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles. Given the singular reactivity observed, a computational study was performed to shed light on the mechanism of this intriguing transformation. Relying on the specific reactivity of the newly installed vinylsilane functionality, the scope of 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles has been enlarged by postfunctionalization.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Induced Nanocrystalline Domain Engineering and Surface Passivation in Mesoporous Chalcogenide Semiconductor Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through plasma&#8208;enabled post&#8208;treatment technology, a constant elastic collision with a large surface area generates periodic lattice vibration at a high potential difference, thereby rearranging the lattice along the electrically preferred direction. Nanocrystallinity of the semiconductor film is dramatically improved through the rearrangement of lattice, and thus the optoelectric properties of the materials are greatly enhanced.







Abstract
The synthesis of highly crystalline mesoporous materials is key to realizing high&#8208;performance chemical and biological sensors and optoelectronics. However, minimizing surface oxidation and enhancing the domain size without affecting the porous nanoarchitecture are daunting challenges. Herein, we report a hybrid technique that combines bottom&#8208;up electrochemical growth with top&#8208;down plasma treatment to produce mesoporous semiconductors with large crystalline domain sizes and excellent surface passivation. By passivating unsaturated bonds without incorporating any chemical or physical layers, these films show better stability and enhancement in the optoelectronic properties of mesoporous copper telluride (CuTe) with different pore diameters. These results provide exciting opportunities for the development of long&#8208;term, stable, and high&#8208;performance mesoporous semiconductor materials for future technologies.

         <title>Carboxyl Methyltransferase Catalysed Formation of Mono&#8208; and Dimethyl Esters under Aqueous Conditions: Application in Cascade Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carboxyl methyltransferase FtpM can catalyse methylation and dimethylation of a wide range of mono&#8208; and dicarboxylic acids, showing high regioselectivity for some diacids. The enzymatic methylation works under aqueous conditions and can therefore be integrated into enzyme cascades as demonstrated by the two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot conversion of bioderived HMF to bioplastics precursor FDME.







Abstract
Carboxyl methyltransferase (CMT) enzymes catalyse the biomethylation of carboxylic acids under aqueous conditions and have potential for use in synthetic enzyme cascades. Herein we report that the enzyme FtpM from Aspergillus fumigatus can methylate a broad range of aromatic mono&#8208; and dicarboxylic acids in good to excellent conversions. The enzyme shows high regioselectivity on its natural substrate fumaryl&#8208;l&#8208;tyrosine, trans, trans&#8208;muconic acid and a number of the dicarboxylic acids tested. Dicarboxylic acids are generally better substrates than monocarboxylic acids, although some substituents are able to compensate for the absence of a second acid group. For dicarboxylic acids, the second methylation shows strong pH dependency with an optimum at pH&#8197;5.5&#8211;6. Potential for application in industrial biotechnology was demonstrated in a cascade for the production of a bioplastics precursor (FDME) from bioderived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF).

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Molecule Based High&#8208;Performance Photothermal Organic Material for Efficient Water Purification and Electricity Generation</title>

         <dc:description>
An umbrella&#8208;like donor&#8208;acceptor system (GDPA&#8208;QCN) based on a bulky dendritic donor (umbrella head) and a liner heterocyclic acceptor (umbrella handle) has been developed. GDPA&#8208;QCN shows strong sunlight absorption and efficient solar&#8208;thermal conversion properties in the solid state and was employed to fabricate a high&#8208;performance water purification and electricity generation system.







Abstract
In this contribution, a unique donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated organic&#8208;small&#8208;molecule photothermal material, namely GDPA&#8208;QCN, is presented. Bulky dendritic triphenylamine (GDPA) was grafted onto quinoxaline&#8208;6,7&#8208;dicarbonitrile (QCN) with a phenyl ring as a bridge to form an &#8220;umbrella&#8221; architecture. Benefited from the particular molecular structure, in solid state, GDPA&#8208;QCN molecules adopted a loose packing mode due to the steric effect of &#8220;umbrella head&#8221; dendritic triphenylamine and flexible molecular structure feature, which allows efficient intramolecular motions and consequently elevates energy dissipation by taking the pathway of thermal deactivation within broad absorption range. The GDPA&#8208;QCN solid has high solar&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency with an absorption range from 300 to 1100&#8197;nm, which can promote superior water purification and electricity generation performance.

         <title>Mapping the Morphological Landscape of Oligomeric Di&#8208;block Peptide&#8211;Polymer Amphiphiles**

Oligomeric di&#8208;block peptide&#8211;polymer amphiphiles (PPAs) provide a modular platform for sophisticated higher&#8208;order assembly, but tools to predict assembly behavior from molecular structure are limited. By systematically characterizing PPAs composed of oligo(ethyl acrylate) and random coil peptides, we outline general design principles of PPAs showing how oligomer length, dispersity, and peptide hydrophilicity impact the morphological distribution.







Abstract
Peptide&#8211;polymer amphiphiles (PPAs) are tunable hybrid materials that achieve complex assembly landscapes by combining the sequence&#8208;dependent properties of peptides with the structural diversity of polymers. Despite their promise as biomimetic materials, determining how polymer and peptide properties simultaneously affect PPA self&#8208;assembly remains challenging. We herein present a systematic study of PPA structure&#8211;assembly relationships. PPAs containing oligo(ethyl acrylate) and random&#8208;coil peptides were used to determine the role of oligomer molecular weight, dispersity, peptide length, and charge density on self&#8208;assembly. We observed that PPAs predominantly formed spheres rather than anisotropic particles. Oligomer molecular weight and peptide hydrophilicity dictated morphology, while dispersity and peptide charge affected particle size. These key benchmarks will facilitate the rational design of PPAs that expand the scope of biomimetic functionality within assembled soft materials.

         <title>Oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) as a Peptide&#8208;Based Molecular Scaffold with a Minimal Structure and High Density of Functionalizable Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) (oligo&#8208;NMA) is proposed as a peptide&#8208;based molecular scaffold with a minimal structure and a high density of functionalizable sites. Computational and NMR spectroscopic analysis suggested that the backbone structure of oligo&#8208;NMA is not largely affected by functionalization. Moreover, the usefulness of oligo&#8208;NMA as a molecular scaffold was demonstrated by the design of protein ligands.







Abstract
Functionalizable synthetic molecules with nanometer sizes and defined shapes in water are useful as molecular scaffolds to mimic the functions of biomacromolecules and develop chemical tools for manipulating biomacromolecules. Herein, we propose oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) (oligo&#8208;NMA) as a peptide&#8208;based molecular scaffold with a minimal structure and a high density of functionalizable sites. Oligo&#8208;NMA forms a defined shape in water without hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks or ring constraints, which enables the molecule to act as a scaffold with minimal atomic composition. Furthermore, functional groups can be readily introduced on the nitrogens and &#945;&#8208;carbons of oligo&#8208;NMA. Computational and NMR spectroscopic analysis suggested that the backbone structure of oligo&#8208;NMA is not largely affected by functionalization. Moreover, the usefulness of oligo&#8208;NMA was demonstrated by the design of protein ligands. The ease of synthesis, minimal structure, and high functionalization flexibility makes oligo&#8208;NMA a useful scaffold for chemical and biological applications.

Unravelling the mechanism &#160;of charge accumulation and utilization in the light&#8208;driven carbon dioxide reduction using iron porphyrins bearing hydrogen bonding scaffolds revealed unprecedented puzzle pieces about its rate limiting step. While the formal Fe(0) redox state has been widely accepted as the catalytically active species, Zakaria Halime, Ally Aukauloo et&#8197;al. show in their Communication (e202117530) that the Fe(I) species is already involved in the substrate activation of the photocatalytic cycle.

         <dc:description>
Solution polymer mechanochemistry is well understood in random coil morphology. In their Research Article (e202115325), Charles&#8197;E. Diesendruck and Hang Zhang assess covalent mechanochemistry when &#945;&#8208;helices are present in covalent macromolecules. Poly(&#947;&#8208;benzyl glutamate)s (PBG) with different helicities are prepared by tuning the enantiomeric excess of the feed monomer. Ultrasonication is used to induce solvodynamic shear, leading to the scission of the polymer into smaller helices.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solution polymer mechanochemistry&lt;/b&gt; is well understood in random coil morphology. In their Research Article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202115325"&gt;(e202115325)&lt;/a&gt;, Charles&#8197;E. Diesendruck and Hang Zhang assess covalent mechanochemistry when &#945;-helices are present in covalent macromolecules. Poly(&#947;-benzyl glutamate)s (PBG) with different helicities are prepared by tuning the enantiomeric excess of the feed monomer. Ultrasonication is used to induce solvodynamic shear, leading to the scission of the polymer into smaller helices.

Gold is a valuable metal that can be dissolved with common household chemicals as reported by Timo Repo&#160;et&#8197;al.&#160;in their Research Article (e202117587). By applying catalytic iodine, aqueous hydrogen peroxide and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole, gold promptly dissolves in ethanol. Catalytic reactions and environmentally benign solvents and reagents are the basis for sustainable development and a gateway to a greener future of precious metals recycling.

Self&#8208;propulsion multifunctional microrobots harboring chiral supramolecular selectors represent a promising pathway for &#8220;enantiorecognition&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; while employing different readouts (e.g., optical and electrical). The combination of different active compounds in a single architecture allows for a multifunctional microrobot that simultaneously exhibits chiral recognition, but also fluorescent properties and the ability to be magnetically navigable and propelled in the presence of a chemical fuel, as described by Martin Pumera and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202116090).

         <title>Inter&#8208;relationships between Oxygen Evolution and Iridium Dissolution Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The storage of excess renewable energy in the form of hydrogen depends on the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and thus the rational design of novel iridium&#8208;based catalysts with improved electrocatalytic properties. To achieve this, it is necessary to understand both the OER and dissolution mechanisms as well as their inter&#8208;relationship. This Minireview gathers state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art information of these phenomena on different Ir catalysts.







Abstract
The widespread utilization of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers currently remains uncertain, as they rely on the use of highly scarce iridium as the only viable catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is known to present the major energy losses of the process. Understanding the mechanistic origin of the different activities and stabilities of Ir&#8208;based catalysts is, therefore, crucial for a scale&#8208;up of green hydrogen production. It is known that structure influences the dissolution, which is the main degradation mechanism and shares common intermediates with the OER. In this Minireview, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art understanding of dissolution and its relationship with the structure of different iridium catalysts is gathered and correlated to different mechanisms of the OER. A perspective on future directions of investigation is also given.

         <dc:description>
The fast diffusion kinetics of NH4+ ions and the abundance of resources have resulted in aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs) gradually emerging as one of most promising approaches for energy storage systems beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This Minireview highlights the most recent advances in electrode materials and electrolytes for AAIBs. An overview of the existing challenges and possible solutions is also given to enable further development of AAIBs.







Abstract
Aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion (NH4+) batteries (AAIB) are a recently emerging technology that utilize the abundant electrode resources and the fast diffusion kinetics of NH4+ to deliver an excellent rate performance at a low cost. Although significant progress has been made on AAIBs, the technology is still limited by various challenges. In this Minireview, the most recent advances are comprehensively summarized and discussed, including cathode and anode materials as well as the electrolytes. Finally, a perspective on possible solutions for the current limitations of AAIBs is provided.

         <title>The Chemistry of Organic Contrast Agents in the NIR&#8208;II Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic fluorophores in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) range have been validated as attractive imaging tools in biomedical research owing to their biocompatibility, flexible chemical structure, and tunable spectra. This Review systematically summarizes recent advances in the chemistry, design principles, and optical properties of NIR&#8208;II organic contrast agents.







Abstract
Optical imaging, especially fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging, is a non&#8208;invasive imaging approach with high spatial and temporal resolution and high sensitivity, compared to positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Due to the merits of imaging using the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window, like deeper penetration depth, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, high resolution, and low tissue damage, researchers have devoted great effort to developing contrast agents with NIR&#8208;II absorption or emission. In this Review, we summarize recently developed organic luminescent and photoacoustic materials, ranging from small molecules to conjugated polymers. Then, we systematically introduce engineering strategies and describe the imaging performance classified by the skeleton cores. Finally, we elucidate the challenges and prospects of these NIR&#8208;II organic dyes for potential clinical applications. We expect our summary can inspire researchers to expand the spectrum of NIR&#8208;II contrast agents for diverse bioapplications.

         <title>Operando Imaging of Chemical Activity on Gold Plates with Single&#8208;Molecule Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the structure&#8211;activity relationship is of crucial importance to the evaluation and the rational design of novel catalysts. Herein, single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence microscopy is employed for super&#8208;resolution mapping of the chemical activity and kinetic analysis of Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;based reactions on single gold plates, which enables spatiotemporal characterizations down to the single&#8208;reaction level.







Abstract
Classical electrochemical characterization tools cannot avoid averaging between the active reaction sites and their support, thus obscuring their intrinsic roles. Single&#8208;molecule electrochemical techniques are thus in high demand. Here, we demonstrate super&#8208;resolution imaging of Ru(bpy)32+ based reactions on Au plates using single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence microscopy. By converting electrochemical signals into optical signals, we manage to achieve the ultimate sensitivity of single&#8208;entity chemistry, that is directly resolving the single photons from individual electrochemical reactions. High spatial resolution, up to 37&#8197;nm, further enables mapping Au chemical activity and the reaction kinetics. The spatiotemporally resolved dynamic structure&#8211;activity relationship on Au plates shows that the restructuring of catalysts plays an important role in determining the reactivity. Our approach may lead to gaining new insights towards evaluating and designing electrocatalytic systems.

         <title>Dissection of Light&#8208;Induced Charge Accumulation at a Highly Active Iron Porphyrin: Insights in the Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptionally high performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photocatalytic reduction displayed by an iron&#8211;porphyrin bearing urea groups in the second coordination sphere is the result of the interaction of CO2 with the catalyst prior to the occurrence of the second electron uptake in the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Iron porphyrins are among the best molecular catalysts for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Powering these catalysts with the help of photosensitizers comes along with a couple of unsolved challenges that need to be addressed with much vigor. We have designed an iron porphyrin catalyst decorated with urea functions (UrFe) acting as a multipoint hydrogen bonding scaffold towards the CO2 substrate. We found a spectacular photocatalytic activity reaching unreported TONs and TOFs as high as 7270 and 3720&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively. While the Fe0 redox state has been widely accepted as the catalytically active species, we show here that the FeI species is already involved in the CO2 activation, which represents the rate&#8208;determining step in the photocatalytic cycle. The urea functions help to dock the CO2 upon photocatalysis. DFT calculations bring support to our experimental findings that constitute a new paradigm in the catalytic reduction of CO2.

         <title>Origin of High Diastereoselectivity in Reactions of Seven&#8208;Membered&#8208;Ring Enolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diastereoselective reactions of chiral seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring enolates have been systematically investigated. Diastereoselectivity was found to be general for &#1013;&#8208;lactams, &#1013;&#8208;lactones, and cycloheptanones with various substituent patterns. Computational investigations provided insight into the origin of the diastereoselectivity. A model for predicting the stereochemistry of seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring enolate alkylations is proposed.







Abstract
Unlike many reactions of their six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring counterparts, the reactions of chiral seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring enolates are highly diastereoselective. Diastereoselectivity was observed for a range of substrates, including lactam, lactone, and cyclic ketone derivatives. The stereoselectivity arises from torsional and steric interactions that develop when electrophiles approach the diastereotopic &#960;&#8208;faces of the enolates, which are distinguished by subtle differences in the orientation of nearby atoms of the ring.

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3: Neutral Metalloid Radical Precursors upon Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3 was proven to be an effective radical precursor under visible&#8208;light photocatalysis. The metalloid nature of Ge allows single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) at the neutral Ge center and leads to advantages in separation and derivatization.







Abstract
Single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidation of ionic hypervalent complexes, in particular alkyltrifluoroborates (Alkyl&#8208;BF3&#8722;) and alkylbis(catecholato)silicates (Alkyl&#8208;Si(cat)2&#8722;), have contributed substantially to alkyl radical generation compared to alkali or alkaline earth organometallics because of their excellent activity&#8211;stability balance. Herein, another proposal is reported by using neutral metalloid compounds, Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3, as radical precursors. Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3 shows comparable activity to that of Alkyl&#8208;BF3&#8722; and Alkyl&#8208;Si(cat)2&#8722; in radical addition reactions. Moreover, Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3 is the first successful group&#8197;14 tetraalkyl nucleophile in nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling. Meanwhile, the neutral nature of these organogermanes offset the limitation of ionic precursors in purification and derivatization. A preliminary mechanism study suggests that an alkyl radical is generated from a tetraalkylgermane radical cation with the assistance of a nucleophile, which may also result in the development of more non&#8208;ionic alkyl radical precursors with a metalloid center.

         <title>Reversible One&#8208; to Two&#8208; to Three&#8208;Dimensional Transformation in CuII Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible multi&#8208;dimensional transformation of a coordination polymer composed of CuII ions and terephthalate ligands was achieved for the first time by controlling the coordination environment. The dimensional transformation led to significant changes in the chemical and physical properties specific to coordination polymers, such as gas sorption and magnetism.







Abstract
A reversible transformation between 1D, 2D, and 3D is demonstrated for the first time in coordination polymers comprising CuII ions and bidentate terephthalate (BDC2&#8722;). 1D uniform chains were reversibly transformed into 2D layers with the construction of Cu&#8208;paddlewheels by eliminating water molecules. 2D/3D reversible transformation was achieved by removing/rebinding N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide coordinated to the paddlewheels. These dimensional transformations significantly changed chemical and physical properties such as gas sorption and magnetism. Although the uptake in open&#8208;framework 1D and 2D Cu&#8208;BDC was insignificant, pronounced absorption was observed for 3D Cu&#8208;BDC. Drastic difference in magnetic behavior is consistent with their coordination structures; uniform 1D chain of CuII in 1D Cu&#8208;BDC and 2D sheet based on CuII&#8208;paddlewheel dimers in 2D Cu&#8208;BDC. Ferromagnetic behavior observed in air&#8208;exposed 3D Cu&#8208;BDC is attributed to the 3D structure formed by the connection of 2D sheets.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Allylic C&#8722;H Alkylation Enabled by a Dual&#8208;Function Cobalt Catalyst**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic allylic C&#8722;H alkylation reaction with carbon nucleophiles is reported, which employs an easily available cobalt&#8211;salen complex as the molecular catalyst. The method is characterized by its excellent functional group tolerance, substrate compatibility with both linear and branched terminal alkenes, and scalability (up to 200&#8197;mmol scale) with a low loading of electrolyte (down to 0.05&#8197;equiv).







Abstract
The direct functionalization of allylic C&#8722;H bonds with nucleophiles minimizes pre&#8208;functionalization and converts inexpensive, abundantly available materials to value&#8208;added alkenyl&#8208;substituted products but remains challenging. Here we report an electrocatalytic allylic C&#8722;H alkylation reaction with carbon nucleophiles employing an easily available cobalt&#8211;salen complex as the molecular catalyst. These C(sp3)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reactions proceed through H2 evolution and require no external chemical oxidants. Importantly, the mild conditions and unique electrocatalytic radical process ensure excellent functional group tolerance and substrate compatibility with both linear and branched terminal alkenes. The synthetic utility of the electrochemical method is highlighted by its scalability (up to 200&#8197;mmol scale) under low loading of electrolyte (down to 0.05&#8197;equiv) and its successful application in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex structures.

         <title>Photoswitchable Molecular Communication between Programmable DNA&#8208;Based Artificial Membraneless Organelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable bi&#8208;directional trafficking of biomolecules between programmable DNA&#8208;based artificial membraneless organelles in a cell&#8208;like microcompartment has been achieved to imitate intracellular communication towards construction of advanced functional artificial cells.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal organization of distinct biological processes in cytomimetic compartments is a crucial step towards engineering functional artificial cells. Mimicking controlled bi&#8208;directional molecular communication inside artificial cells remains a considerable challenge. Here we present photoswitchable molecular transport between programmable membraneless organelle&#8208;like DNA coacervates in a synthetic microcompartment. We use droplet microfluidics to fabricate membraneless non&#8208;fusing DNA coacervates by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in a water&#8208;in&#8208;oil droplet, and employ the interior DNA coacervates as artificial organelles to imitate intracellular communication via photo&#8208;regulated uni&#8208; and bi&#8208;directional transfer of biomolecules. Our results highlight a promising new route to assembly of multicompartment artificial cells with functional networks.

         <title>Cyclic Solid&#8208;State Multiple Phase Changes with Tuned Photoemission in a Gold Thiolate Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;emissive amorphous AuI&#8211;thiolate coordination polymer undergoes two successive crystallisation phase changes on mild solid&#8208;state heating. The first high symmetric crystalline phase becomes slightly red&#8208;emissive and the second, which has a lower symmetry, exhibits intense luminescence due to the presence of aurophilic interactions. These transitions are reversible upon soft hand grinding, offering potential for non&#8208;volatile memories.







Abstract
The discovery of a universal memory that exhibits fast access speed, high&#8208;density storage, and non&#8208;volatility has fuelled research into phase&#8208;change materials over the past decades. In spite of the efficiency of the inorganic chalcogenides for phase&#8208;change random access memory (PCRAM), they still have some inherent drawbacks, such as high temperature required for phase change and difficulty to control the domain size of the phase change, because of their brittleness. Here we present a AuI&#8211;thiolate coordination polymer which undergoes two successive phase changes on application of mild heating (&lt;200&#8201;&#176;C) from amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline1&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline2 phases. These transitions are reversible upon soft hand grinding. More importantly, each phase exhibits different photoluminescent properties for an efficient optical read&#8208;out. We believe that the ability of the AuI&#8211;thiolate coordination polymer to have reversible phase changes under soft conditions and at the same time to display distinct optical signals, can pave the way for the next generation of PCRAM.

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral Aldehydes by N&#8208;Heterocyclic&#8208;Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization Followed by Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective esterification of dialdehydes led to structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes in good yields, with high enantioselectivity enabled by unprecedented NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of the dialdehydes followed by kinetic resolution. This protocol, which features mild reaction conditions and broad functional&#8208;group tolerance, provides modular access to value&#8208;added axially chiral aldehydes and their derivatives.







Abstract
Axially chiral aldehydes have received increasing attention in enantioselective catalysis. However, only very few catalytic methods have been developed to construct structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes. We herein describe an NHC&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective esterification of biaryl dialdehydes as a general and practical strategy for the construction of axially chiral aldehydes. Mechanistic studies indicate that coupling proceeds through a novel combination of NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of the dialdehydes and kinetic resolution. This protocol features excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, and applicability to late&#8208;stage functionalization and provides a modular platform for the synthesis of axially chiral aldehydes and their derivatives.

         <title>Hydrocarbon Macrocycle Conformer Ensembles and 13C&#8208;NMR Spectra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum mechanical investigations of hydrocarbon macrocycle ensembles in solution by comparison of experimental and computed 13C&#8208;NMR spectra are described. The excellent agreement between experiment and theory allows the deduction of contributing molecular conformations.







Abstract
NMR as a routine analytical method provides important three&#8208;dimensional structure information of compounds in solution. Here we apply the recently released CRENSO computational workflow for the automated generation of conformer ensembles to the quantum mechanical calculation of 13C&#8208;NMR spectra of a series of flexible cycloalkanes up to C20H40. We evaluate the computed chemical shifts in comparison with corresponding experimental data in chloroform. It is shown that accurate and properly averaged theoretical NMR data can be obtained in about a day of computation time on a standard workstation computer. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment enables one to deduce preferred conformations of large, non&#8208;rigid macrocycles under ambient conditions from our automated procedure.

         <title>Self&#8208;Evolution of High Mechanical Strength Dry&#8208;Network Polythiourethane Thermosets into Neat Macroscopic Hollow Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to obtain macroscopic hollow structures was developed involving a self&#8208;evolution process from dry&#8208;network polythiourethane thermosets (PTUs) polymer films to neat hollow objects via immersion of aqueous NaOH solutions.







Abstract
Organism&#8208;inspired hollow structures are attracting increasing interest for the construction of various bionic functional hollow materials. Next&#8208;generation self&#8208;evolution hollow materials tend to combine simple synthesis, high mechanical strength, and regular shape. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel dry&#8208;network polythiourethane thermoset with excellent mechanical performance. The polymer film could evolve into a neat and well&#8208;organized object with a macroscopic hollow interior structure after being immersed in an aqueous NaOH solution. The self&#8208;evolution hollow structure originated from a hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network, which was later transformed into a network bearing both hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds. The swelling and thickness growth of this material could be controlled by the NaOH concentration and the immersion time. This unique self&#8208;evolution behavior was further utilized to produce a series of macroscopic 3D hollow&#8208;containing molds, which could be potentially applied in the production of smart materials.

         <title>Homogeneously Large Polarons in Aromatic Passivators Improves Charge Transport between Perovskite Grains for &gt;24&#8201;% Efficiency in Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transport behavior of two amine Cu porphyrin supramolecules with different stacking interactions in perovskite grain boundaries was investigated in detail. Results prove that the construction of homogeneously large polarons (HLPs) in aromatic passivators is a key factor for the charge transport between perovskite grains. This work also affords a new strategy to design new optoelectronic materials with improved charge mobilities.







Abstract
Aromatic passivators, such as porphyrin, with large &#960;&#8208;backbones have attracted considerable attention to boost the charge carrier in polycrystalline perovskite films, thus enabling the fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, they often self&#8208;assemble into supramolecules that probably influence the charge&#8208;transfer process in the perovskite grain boundary. Here, by doping a monoamine Cu porphyrin into perovskite films, two porphyrin&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled supramolecules were successfully prepared between perovskite grains. Crystal structures and theoretical analyses reveal the presence of a stronger interaction between the amine units and the central Cu ions of neighbouring porphyrins in one of the supramolecules. This has a modified effect on the dipole direction of the porphyrins to be quantized as homogeneously large polarons (HLPs) in a periodic lattice. The porphyrin supramolecules can stabilize perovskite grain boundaries to greatly improve the stability of PSCs, while the HLPs&#8208;featured supramolecule facilitates hole transport across perovskite grains to remarkably increase the cell performance to as high as 24.2&#8201;%. This work proves that the modulation of the intermolecular interaction of aromatic passivators to yield HLPs is crucial for the cascaded acceleration of charge transport between perovskite grains.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time NMR Recording of Fermentation and Lipid Metabolism Processes in Live Microalgae Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of solid&#8208;state MAS NMR on live microalgae for monitoring of fermentation, lipid metabolism and structural dynamics changes is demonstrated. Conversion of galactolipids into TAG and free fatty acids is observed, accompanied with rapid loss of rigid lipid structures. It is concluded that high cell densities, creating dark, anoxia conditions, induce lipid catabolism and cell death resulting in breakdown of cell and organelle membranes.







Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive and real&#8208;time recording of processes in living cells has been limited to detection of small cellular components such as soluble proteins and metabolites. Here we report a multiphase NMR approach using magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR to synchronously follow microbial processes of fermentation, lipid metabolism and structural dynamic changes in live microalgae cells. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii green algae were highly concentrated, introducing dark fermentation and anoxia conditions. Single&#8208;pulse NMR experiments were applied to obtain temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic profiles of the formed fermentation products. Through dynamics&#8208;based spectral editing NMR, simultaneous conversion of galactolipids into TAG and free fatty acids was observed and rapid loss of rigid lipid structures. This suggests that lipolysis under dark and anoxia conditions finally results in the breakdown of cell and organelle membranes, which could be beneficial for recovery of intracellular microbial useful products.

         <title>Hybrid Elastic Organic Crystals that Respond to Aerial Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of lightweight, mechanically reinforced, hygroresponsive organic crystalline hybrid materials has been synthesized by a universally applicable approach. The crystals are robust, durable, and moisture&#8208;absorbing, and show a highly linear deformation over a wide range of relative humidity. Such precise spatiotemporal control over the light output in response to air humidity allows the materials to be used as optical waveguides.







Abstract
Reshaping of elongated organic crystals that can be used as semiconductors, waveguides or soft robotic grippers by application of force or light is now a commonplace, however mechanical response of organic crystals to changes in humidity has not been accomplished yet. Here, we report a universal approach to instigating a humidity response into elastically bendable organic crystals that elicits controllable deformation with linear response to aerial humidity while retaining their physical integrity entirely intact. Hygroresponsive bilayer elements are designed by mechanically coupling a humidity&#8208;responsive polymer with elastic molecular crystals that have been mechanically reinforced by a polymer coating. As an illustration of the application of these cladded crystalline actuators, they are tested as active optical transducers of visible light where the position of light output can be precisely controlled by variations in aerial humidity. Within a broader context, the approach described here provides access to a vast range of mechanically robust, lightweight hybrid hygroresponsive crystalline materials.

         <dc:description>As part of our interest in unusual bonding situations, we are now targeting complexes featuring metal&#8594;carbon dative bonds.&#160; Here, we report on the formation of such linkages in a series of group 10 complexes featuring a triarylphosphine ligand functionalized at the g position by a carbenium ion. Through combined synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational studies, we show that the M&#8594;C  carbenium  interaction present in these complexes scales with the basicity of the donor, confirming its dative nature.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160; biological and therapeutic significance of natural products is a powerful impetus for the development of efficient methods to facilitate their construction. Accordingly, and reflecting the prevalence of beta&#8208;oxy&#8208;carbonyl motifs,, a sophisticated arsenal of aldol&#8208;based strategies has evolved that is contingent on the generation of single enolate isomers. Since this has the potential to compromise efficiency in reagent&#8208;based paradigms, direct catalysis&#8208;based solutions would be enabling. To complement the array of substrate&#8208;based strategies, and regulate enolate geometry at the catalyst level, a direct catalytic alkylation of esters with oxyallenes has been developed. Synergizing metal hydride reactivity with Lewis base catalysis has resulted in a broad reaction scope with useful levels of stereocontrol (up to &gt;99%  ee  ). Facile derivatization of these ambiphilic linchpins is demonstrated, providing access to high&#8208;value  vicinal  stereocenter&#8208;containing motifs, including 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Signal Transduction Strategies for Analyte Detection using DNA&#8208;Based Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;based nanostructures as probes have led to significant advances in chemical and biological sensing, allowing for the detection of analytes in complex media, the understanding of fundamental biological processes, and the ability to diagnose diseases based on molecular signatures. The utility of these structures arises both from DNA&#8217;s inherent ability to selectively recognize and bind a variety of chemical species and from the unique properties observed when DNA is restructured at the nanoscale. In this Minireview, we chronicle the most commonly used signal transduction strategies that have been interfaced with various DNA&#8208;based nanostructures. We discuss the types of analytes and the detection scenarios that are sought after, delineate the advantages and disadvantages of each signaling strategy, and outline the key considerations that guide the selection of each signaling method.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligomeric Acceptor: A &#8220;Two&#8208;in&#8208;One&#8221; Strategy to Bridge Small Molecules and Polymers for Stable Solar Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligomeric acceptors are expected to combine the advantages of both highly developed small molecular and polymeric acceptors. However, organic solar cells (OSCs) based on oligomers lag far behind due to their slow development and low diversity. Here, three oligomeric acceptors were produced through oligomerization of small molecules. The dimer dBTIC&#947;&#8208;EH achieved the best power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 14.48% in bulk heterojunction devices and possess T80 (80% of the initial PCE) lifetime of&#160;1020 h under illumination, which are far better than that of small molecular and polymeric acceptors. More excitingly, it showed PCEs of 16.06% in quasi&#8208;planar heterojunction (Q&#8208;PHJ) devices which is the highest value OSCs using oligomeric acceptors to date. These results suggest that oligomerization of small molecules is a promising strategy to achieve OSCs with optimized performance between the high efficiency and durable stability, and give oligomeric materials a shining future in the commercial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Extraction of Transition Metals from Spent LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 Cathode via Regulation of Coordination Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The complexity of chemical compounds in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) results in great difficulties in the extraction of multiple transition metals, which have similar physicochemical characteristics. Here, we propose a novel strategy for selective extraction of nickel, cobalt, and manganese from spent LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 (NCM) cathode through the regulation of coordination environment. Depending on adjusting the composition of ligand in transition metal complexes, a tandem leaching and separation system is designed and finally enables nickel, cobalt, and manganese to enrich in the form of NiO, Co3O4, and Mn3O4 with high recovery yields of 99.1%, 95.1%, and 95.3%, respectively. We further confirm that the combination of different transition metals with well&#8208;designed ligands is the key to good selectivity. Through our work, fine&#8208;tuning the coordination environment of metal ions is proved to have great prospects in the sustainable development of the battery recycling industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Microsecond Backbone Motions Modulate the Oligomerization of the DNAJB6 Chaperone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chaperone self&#8208;oligomerization that competes with substrate assembly is an important aspect of anti&#8208;aggregation chaperones that remains poorly understood. Using the J domain chaperone DNAJB6, how the Parkinson's related T193A mutation affects chaperone oligomerization has been explored. The C&#8208;terminal domain of DNAJB6b exhibits significant microsecond dynamics that are enhanced in the T193A mutant, leading to a monomeric partially&#8208;folded state.







Abstract
DNAJB6 is a prime example of an anti&#8208;aggregation chaperone that functions as an oligomer. DNAJB6 oligomers are dynamic and subunit exchange is critical for inhibiting client protein aggregation. The T193A mutation in the C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD) of DNAJB6 reduces both chaperone self&#8208;oligomerization and anti&#8208;aggregation of client proteins, and has recently been linked to Parkinson's disease. Here, we show by NMR, including relaxation&#8208;based methods, that the T193A mutation has minimal effects on the structure of the &#946;&#8208;stranded CTD but increases the population and rate of formation of a partially folded state. The results can be rationalized in terms of &#946;&#8208;strand peptide plane flips that occur on a timescale of &#8776;100&#8197;&#956;s and lead to global changes in the overall pleat/flatness of the CTD, thereby altering its ability to oligomerize. These findings help forge a link between chaperone dynamics, oligomerization and anti&#8208;aggregation activity which may possibly lead to new therapeutic avenues tuned to target specific substrates.

         <title>A New Platform of B/N&#8208;Doped Cyclophanes: Access to a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Block&#8208;Type B3N3 Macrocycle with Strong Dipole Moment and Unique Optoelectronic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual block&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycle MC&#8208;b&#8208;B3N3 that shows a strong dipole moment and a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap is introduced. Compared with other cyclic hexamers, its unique orientation of electron&#8208;donor block and acceptor block resulted in largely red&#8208;shifted orange emission both in solution and in the solid state.







Abstract
We herein describe a new design principle to achieve B/N&#8208;doped cyclophane where an electron&#8208;donor block of three triarylamines (Ar3N) and an acceptor block of three triarylboranes (Ar3B) are spatially separated on opposite sides of the &#960;&#8208;extended ring system. DFT computations revealed the distinct electronic structure of the block&#8208;type macrocycle MC&#8208;b&#8208;B3N3 with a greatly enhanced dipole moment and reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap in comparison to its analogue with alternating B and N sites, MC&#8208;alt&#8208;B3N3. The unique arrangement of borane acceptor Ar3B and amine donor Ar3N components in MC&#8208;b&#8208;B3N3 induces exceptionally strong intramolecular charge transfer in the excited state, which is reflected in a largely red&#8208;shifted luminescence at 612&#8197;nm in solution. The respective linear open&#8208;chain oligomer L&#8208;b&#8208;B3N3 was also synthesized for comparison. Our new approach to donor&#8211;acceptor macrocycles offers important fundamental insights and opens up a new avenue to unique optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;NHC&#8208;Catalyzed gem&#8208;Specific O&#8208;Selective Hydropyridonation of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rh&#8208;IPr catalyst was reported for the synthesis of gem&#8208;O&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;oxypyridines by selective O&#8208;addition of 2&#8208;pyridones to terminal alkynes. A preferable N&#8208;coordination mode within the metallacyclopropene intermediate species causes a seesaw effect responsible for the O&#8208;nucleophilic attack.







Abstract
The dinuclear complex [Rh(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(&#951;2&#8208;coe)(IPr)]2 is an efficient catalyst for the O&#8208;selective Markovnikov&#8208;type addition of 2&#8208;pyridones to terminal alkynes. DFT calculations support a hydride&#8208;free pathway entailing intramolecular oxidative protonation of a &#960;&#8208;alkyne by a &#954;1N&#8208;hydroxypyridine ligand. Subsequent O&#8208;nucleophilic attack on a metallacyclopropene species affords an O&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxypyridine chelate rhodium intermediate as the catalyst resting state. The release of the alkenyl ether is calculated as the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Pushing the Length Limit of Dihydrodiboraacenes: Synthesis and Characterizations of Boron&#8208;Embedded Heptacene and Nonacene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihydrodiboraheptacene and dihydrodiboranonacene, the hitherto longest boron&#8208;embedded heteroacenes, have been successfully synthesized. Both compounds exhibit highly efficient anti&#8208;Kasha emissions through the thermal population mechanism, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of dihydrodiboraheptacene is as high as 98&#177;2&#8201;%. This work provides new opportunities for the development of novel boraacene&#8208;based functional materials.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;embedded heteroacenes (boraacenes) have attracted enormous interest in organic chemistry and materials science. However, extending the skeleton of boraacenes to higher acenes (N&#8805;6) is synthetically challenging because of their limited stability under ambient conditions. Herein, we report the synthesis of boron&#8208;embedded heptacene (DBH) and nonacene (DBN) as the hitherto longest boraacenes. The former is highly stable (even after 240&#8197;h in tetrahydrofuran), while the latter is air&#8208;sensitive with the half&#8208;life (t1/2) of 11.8&#8197;min. The structures of both compounds are verified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, revealing a linear backbone with an antiaromatic C4B2 core. Photophysical characterizations associated with theoretical calculations indicate that both compounds exhibit highly efficient anti&#8208;Kasha emissions. Remarkably, the air&#8208;stable DBH manifests an ultrahigh photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 98&#177;2&#8201;% and can be chemically reduced to its radical anion and dianion states, implying the value of boron&#8208;doped higher acenes as novel functional materials.

Herein, we report the synthesis of boron-embedded heptacene (&lt;b&gt;DBH&lt;/b&gt;) and nonacene (&lt;b&gt;DBN&lt;/b&gt;) as the hitherto longest boraacenes. The former is highly stable (even after 240&#8197;h in tetrahydrofuran), while the latter is air-sensitive with the half-life (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) of 11.8&#8197;min. The structures of both compounds are verified by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, revealing a linear backbone with an antiaromatic C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core. Photophysical characterizations associated with theoretical calculations indicate that both compounds exhibit highly efficient anti-Kasha emissions. Remarkably, the air-stable &lt;b&gt;DBH&lt;/b&gt; manifests an ultrahigh photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 98&#177;2&#8201;% and can be chemically reduced to its radical anion and dianion states, implying the value of boron-doped higher acenes as novel functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemically Controlled Switchable Copolymerization of Lactide, Carbon Dioxide, and Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemically switchable strategy was developed for the copolymerization of lactide (LA), CO2 and epoxides to easily synthesize multi&#8208;block copolymers of polylactide (PLA) and polycarbonate (PC).







Abstract
Electrochemical redox&#8208;control is an emerging strategy for the regulation of polymerization process without the addition of external oxidants and reductants, which enables the control over composition, microstructure and properties of the polymer products. In this paper, based on the chemical selectivity of heterometallic Salen&#8208;Co&#8208;Mn complexes of different valences, an electrochemically switchable strategy was developed for the copolymerization of lactide (LA), CO2 and epoxides. The switchable redox reactions endowed this system with the capability to easily synthesize a multi&#8208;block copolymer of polylactide (PLA) and polycarbonate (PC). Moreover, the multi&#8208;block copolymer could be further modified by introducing various monomers with different microstructures and functional groups.

         <title>Oxidase&#8208;Type C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H Coupling Using an Isoquinoline&#8208;Derived Organic Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isoquinoline&#8208;derived diaryl ketone&#8208;type photocatalyst was designed and synthesized. This photocatalyst enabled visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of heteroarenes with alkanes and aldehydes using air as the sole oxidant. An unconventional mechanism with &#8220;self&#8208;quenching&#8221; to generate an isoquinoline N&#8208;radical cation to trigger hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) is involved, according to time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopic and mass spectrometry studies.







Abstract
Oxidase&#8208;type oxidation is an attractive strategy in organic synthesis due to the use of O2 as the terminal oxidant. Organic photocatalysis can effect metal&#8208;free oxidase chemistry. Nevertheless, current methods are limited in reaction scope, possibly due to the lack of suitable photocatalysts. Here we report an isoquinoline&#8208;derived diaryl ketone&#8208;type photocatalyst, which has much enhanced absorption of blue and visible light compared to conventional diaryl ketones. This photocatalyst enables dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of heteroarenes with unactivated and activated alkanes as well as aldehydes using air as the oxidant. A wide range of heterocycles with various functional groups are suitable substrates. Transient absorption and excited&#8208;state quenching experiments point to an unconventional mechanism that involves an excited state &#8220;self&#8208;quenching&#8221; process to generate the N&#8208;radical cation form of the sensitizer, which subsequently abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate to yield a reactive alkyl radical.

         <title>Boosted Inner Surface Charge Transfer in Perovskite Nanodots@Mesoporous Titania Frameworks for Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskites (Cs3Bi2Br9, Cs2AgBiBr6) are grown in situ in a mesoporous titania framework for efficient CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). A benchmarked production rate of CH4 (32.9 and 24.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) is achieved with selectivity values of 88.7&#8201;% and 84.2&#8201;%, respectively. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectronic spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy reveal that the inner surface built&#8208;in electric field between the perovskite nanodots and mesoporous titania channels can efficiently promote photo&#8208;induced charge transfer.







Abstract
Exploring high&#8208;efficiency and stable halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts for the selective reduction of CO2 to methane is a challenge because of the intrinsic photo&#8208; and chemical instability of halide perovskites. In this study, halide perovskites (Cs3Bi2Br9 and Cs2AgBiBr6) were grown in situ in mesoporous TiO2 frameworks for an efficient CO2 reduction. Benchmarked CH4 production rates of 32.9 and 24.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with selectivities of 88.7&#8201;% and 84.2&#8201;%, were achieved, respectively, which are better than most reported halide perovskite photocatalysts. Focused ion&#8208;beam sliced&#8208;imaging techniques were used to directly image the hyperdispersed perovskite nanodots confined in mesopores with tunable sizes ranging from 3.8 to 9.9&#8197;nm. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectronic spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy showed that the built&#8208;in electric field between the perovskite nanodots and mesoporous titania channels efficiently promoted photo&#8208;induced charge transfer. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the high methane selectivity was attributed to the Bi&#8208;adsorption&#8208;mediated hydrogenation of *CO to *HCO that dominates CO desorption.

         <dc:description>
The Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction is an emblematic method for constructing C&#8722;C bonds at aromatic positions. Rendering this reaction dehydrogenative on a broad scope of substrates under simple reaction conditions constitutes an important milestone for synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
The first non&#8208;directed dehydrogenative phenone coupling method of methylarenes with aromatic C&#8722;H bonds, displaying a large substrate scope, is herein reported. This reaction represents a far more direct atom&#8208; and step&#8208;efficient alternative to the classical Friedel&#8211;Crafts or Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura derived acylation reactions. The method can be carried out on a gram scale and was successfully applied to the synthesis of several Ketoprofen drug analogues.

         <title>Topochemical Postulates: Are They Relevant for Topochemical Reactions Occurring at Elevated Temperatures?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A inositol&#8208;derived monomer decorated with azide and alkyne groups as reactive units, crystallizes as three distinct polymorphs. Though all the reactive units are not preorganized for topochemical reaction in pristine crystals, at high temperatures the trimorphs undergo regiospecific TAAC reaction yielding polymorphs of 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1,4&#8208;yl&#8208;linked polyinositol. A large cooperative molecular motion in the crystal lattice enabled this topochemical reaction.







Abstract
A rigid inositol&#8208;derived monomer functionalized with azide and alkyne as the complementary reactive groups (CRGs) crystallized as three distinct polymorphs I&#8211;III. Despite the unsuitable orientation of CRGs in the crystals for complete polymerization, all the three polymorphs underwent regiospecific and quantitative topochemical azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization upon heating to yield three different polymorphs of 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl&#8208;linked&#8208;poly&#8208;neo&#8208;inositol. The molecules in these polymorphs exploit the weak intermolecular interactions, free space in the crystal lattice, and heat energy for their large and cooperative molecular motion to attain a transient reactive orientation, ultimately leading to the regiospecific TAAC reaction yielding distinct crystalline polymers. This study cautions that the overreliance on topochemical postulates for the prediction of topochemical reactivity at high temperatures could be misleading.

&lt;p&gt;A inositol-derived monomer decorated with azide and alkyne groups as reactive units, crystallizes as three distinct polymorphs. Though all the reactive units are not preorganized for topochemical reaction in pristine crystals, at high temperatures the trimorphs undergo regiospecific TAAC reaction yielding polymorphs of 1,2,3-triazol-1,4-yl-linked polyinositol. A large cooperative molecular motion in the crystal lattice enabled this topochemical reaction.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Doubly&#8208;Strapped Isolated Perylene Diimide Chromophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble perylene diimide (PDI) cyclophane consisting of a central PDI chromophore enclosed by double cationic molecular straps has been synthesized. Owing to the effective spatial isolation, self&#8208;aggregation of the chromophore in water is completely eliminated, which enables the cyclophane to be employed for lysosome&#8208;targetable live&#8208;cell imaging and antibacterial applications.







Abstract
Perylene diimides (PDIs), a well&#8208;studied class of organic dyes, have a strong tendency to self&#8208;aggregate in water, thus greatly restricting their phototheranostic applications. Herein, we report a water&#8208;soluble PDI cyclophane &#8220;Gemini Box&#8221; (GBox&#8208;14+), consisting of a central PDI chromophore enclosed by double&#8208;sided cationic molecular straps. Owing to the effective spatial isolation, the chromophore self&#8208;aggregation can be completely eliminated, even in a concentrated aqueous solution up to 2&#8197;mM. To our knowledge, GBox&#8208;14+ represents an interesting example of a fluorescent PDI cyclophane in water, capable of being employed for lysosome&#8208;targetable live&#8208;cell imaging. More importantly, the highly concentrated aqueous solution of PDI radical anion can be significantly stabilized by GBox&#8208;14+ to exhibit an excellent near&#8208;infrared photothermal effect, which was further exploited for efficient and selective antibacterial applications. This work provides a new access to water&#8208;soluble non&#8208;aggregated organic dyes and promotes their potential biomedical applications.

         <dc:description>
The enzymatic synthesis of eight luciferin analogues from phenolic derivatives in one&#8208;pot reactions is reported by Pimchai Chaiyen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202116908). Two novel D&#8208;luciferin analogues with methyl substituents were obtained; these compounds emit red and brighter light than the native D&#8208;luciferin. Also developed was a new detection technology named LUMOS for in situ detection of organophosphate pesticides (OPs) including parathion, methyl parathion, EPN, profenofos and fenitrothion at parts per trillion (ppt) levels without requiring sample pretreatment.

         <title>A Nonenzymatic Analog of Pyrimidine Nucleobase Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolic theories for the origin of life posit that inorganic catalysts enabled self&#8208;organized chemical precursors to the pathways of metabolism, including those that make genetic molecules. Recently, experiments showing nonenzymatic versions of a number of core metabolic pathways have started to support this idea. However, experimental demonstrations of nonenzymatic reaction sequences along the  de novo  ribonucleotide biosynthesis pathways are limited. Here we show that all three reactions of pyrimidine nucleobase biosynthesis that convert aspartate to orotate proceed at 60 &#186;C without photochemistry under aqueous conditions in the presence of metals such as Cu  2+  and Mn  4+  . Combining reactions into one&#8208;pot variants is also possible. Life may not have invented pyrimidine nucleobase biosynthesis from scratch, but simply refined existing nonenzymatic reaction channels. This work is a first step towards uniting metabolic theories of life&#8217;s origin with those centered around genetic molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new class of polymeric hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) are explored by inserting a two&#8208;dimensionally conjugated fluoro&#8208;substituted pyrene into thiophene and selenophene polymeric chains. The broad conjugated plane of pyrene and &#8220;Lewis soft&#8221; selenium atoms not only enhance the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of HTM molecules greatly but also render a strong interaction with perovskite surface, leading to an efficient charge transport/transfer in both HTM layer and perovskite/HTM interface. Note that fluorine substitution adjacent to pyrene boosts the stacking of HTMs towards a more favorable face&#8208;on orientation, further facilitating the efficient charge transport. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing  PE10  as dopant&#8208;free HTM afford an excellent efficiency of 22.3% and dramatically enhanced the device longevity, qualifying it among the best PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Disulfide Exchange Polymerization of Polyguanidine for Effective Biomedical Applications by Thiol&#8208;Mediated Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New preparation methods of vectors are the key to developing next generation of biomacromolecule delivery systems. In this study, a controllable disulfide exchange polymerization was established to obtain low&#8208;toxicity and efficient bioreducible polyguanidines (mPEG225&#8208;b&#8208;PSSn, n = 13, 26, 39, 75, 105) by regulating the concentration of activated nucleophiles and reaction time under mild reaction conditions. The relationship between the degrees of polymerization and biocompatibility was studied to identify the optimal polyguanidine mPEG225&#8208;b&#8208;PSS26. Such polyguanidine exhibited good in virto performance in delivering different functional nucleic acids. The impressive therapeutic effects of mPEG225&#8208;b&#8208;PSS26 were further verified in the 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice as well as the mice with full&#8208;thickness skin defects. Controllable disulfide exchange polymerization provides an attractive strategy for the construction of new biomacromolecule delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new bioorthogonal reactions with mutual orthogonality to classic bioorthogonal reactions such as the strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne click reaction and the inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction is of great importance in providing chemical tools for multiplex labelling of live cells. Here we report the first anionic cycloaddend&#8208;promoted bioorthogonal cycloaddition reaction between phenanthrene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione and furan&#8208;2( 3H  )&#8208;one derivatives, where the high polarity of water is exploited to stabilize the highly electron&#8208;rich anionic cycloaddend. The reaction is metal&#8208; and strain&#8208;free, which proceeds rapidly in aqueous solution and on live cells with a second&#8208;order rate constants up to 119 M &#8208;1  s &#8208;1  . The combined utilization of this reaction together with the two other widely used bioorthogonal reactions allows for mutually orthogonal labelling of three types of proteins or three groups of living cells in one batch without cross&#8208;talking. Such results highlight the great potential for multiplex labelling of different biomolecules in live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>(Hetero)aryl&#8210;S(VI) Fluorides: Synthetic Development and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>(Hetero)arylsulfur compounds where the S atom is in the oxidation state (VI) represent a large percentage of the molecular functionalities present in organic chemistry. More specifically, (hetero)aryl&#8210;S(VI) fluorides have recently received enormous attention due to their potential as chemical biology probes, as a result of their reactivity in a simple, modular and ef&#64257;cient manner. Whereas the synthesis and application of the level 1 of fluorination at S(VI) (sulfonyl and sulfonimidoyl fluorides) have been widely studied and reviewed, the synthetic strategies towards higher levels of fluorination (level 2 to 5) are somewhat more limited. This Minireview evaluates and summarizes the progress in the synthesis of highly fluorinated aryl&#8210;S(VI) compounds at all levels, discussing synthetic strategies, reactivity, the advantages and disadvantages of the synthetic protocols, the proposed mechanisms and the potential upcoming opportunities.</dc:description>

         <title>Pentafluorophosphato&#8208;Phenylalanines:&#160;Amphiphilic Phosphotyrosine Mimetics Displaying Fluorine&#8208;Specific Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphotyrosine residues are essential functional switches in health and disease. Thus, phosphotyrosine biomimetics are crucial for the development of chemical tools and drug molecules. We report here the discovery and investigation of pentafluorophosphato amino acids as novel phosphotyrosine biomimetics. A mild acidic pentafluorination protocol was developed and two PF5&#8208;amino acids were prepared and employed in peptide synthesis. Their structures, reactivities, and fluorine&#8208;specific interactions were studied by NMR and IR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and in bioactivity assays. The mono&#8208;anionic PF5 motif displayed an amphiphilic character binding to hydrophobic surfaces, to water molecules, and to protein&#8208;binding sites, exploiting charge and H&#8208;F&#8208;bonding interactions. The novel motifs bind 25&#8208; to 30&#8208;fold stronger to the phosphotyrosine binding site of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B than the best current biomimetics, as rationalized by computational methods, including molecular dynamics simulations.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ring&#8211;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of cyclopropenes using hydrazonium initiators is described. The initiators, which are formed by the condensation of 2,3&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and an aldehyde, polymerize cyclopropene monomers by a sequence of [3+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion reactions. This process generates short chain polyolefins (Mn &#8804; 9.4 kg/mol) with relatively low dispersities (&#272; &#8804; 1.4). The optimized conditions showed efficiency comparable to that achieved with Grubbs&#8217; 2nd generation catalyst for the polymerization of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;phenylcyclopropene. A positive correlation between monomer to initiator ratio and degree of polymerization was revealed through NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Lactonization of Alkynylmalonic Acids Enabled by Chiral Bifunctional P,N ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the linear coordination nature of gold(I) catalysts, achieving high enantiocontrol in asymmetric gold catalysis is a big challenge. To improve the enantiocontrol of gold catalysis, an ion&#8208;pairing strategy was therefore proposed. A series of bifunctional P,N ligands based on chiral spirocyclic and biaryl scaffolds were synthesized and applied in the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric lactonization of alkynylmalonic acids. A wide range of chiral lactones containing an &#945;&#8208;position quaternary stereocenter were synthesized with high yields, excellent regioselectivity and enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions. The synthetic utilities of the current reaction were demonstrated by gram scale synthesis and transformations of chiral lactones. The origin of enantioselectivity and the role of the alcohol additive were elucidated  via  control experiments and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>A Class of Readily Tunable Planar&#8208;Chiral Cyclopentadienyl Rhodium(III) Catalyst for Asymmetric C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral half&#8208;sandwich cyclopentadienyl rhodium(III) (CpRh  III  ) complexes are powerful catalysts to promote asymmetric C&#8208;H activation reactions. Their preparation normally involved linking or embedding the Cp motif to or into a certain chiral backbone to forge the so&#8208;called chiral Cp ligand. However, preparation of planar&#8208;chiral CpRh  III  catalyst bearing a non&#8208;chiral Cp ligand remains a formidable challenge and rarely reported. We describe herein an unusual class of planar&#8208;chiral rhodium catalysts bearing non&#8208;chiral Cp ligands. Differed from existing ones, this catalyst is facile to tune. Twelve chiral CpRh  III  catalysts had been prepared with ease, and successfully used into two enantioselective C&#8208;H activation reactions. Given its convenient synthesis and high structural tunability, this catalyst is expected to find more utilities in asymmetric C&#8208;H activation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Dinitrogen coordination to iron centers underpins industrial and biological fixation in the Haber&#8208;Bosch process and by the FeM cofactors in the nitrogenase enzymes.

         <title>Achieving 37.1% Green Electroluminescent Efficiency and 0.09 eV Full Width at Half Maximum Based on a Ternary Boron&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Nitrogen Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a ternary boron&#8208;oxygen&#8208;nitrogen embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with multiple resonance thermally activated delayed &#64258;uorescence (MR&#8208;TADF), namely DBNO, is developed by adopting the  para  boron&#8208;&#960;&#8208;boron and  para  oxygen&#8208;&#960;&#8208;oxygen strategy. The designed molecule presents a vivid green emission with high photoluminescence quantum yield (96%) and extremely narrow    full width at half maximum  (FWHM) of 19 nm/0.09 eV, which surpasses all previously reported green TADF emitters to date. In addition, the long molecular structure along the transition dipole moment direction endows it with a high horizontal emitting dipole ratio of 96%. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on DBNO reveals a narrowband green emission with a peak at 504 nm and a FWHM of 24 nm/0.12 eV. Particularly, a significantly improved device performance is achieved by the TADF&#8208;sensitization (  hyperfluorescence  ) mechanism, presenting a FWHM of 27 nm and maximum external quantum efficiency of 37.1%.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting the Productivity of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products by Enhancing CO2 Diffusion through Porous Organic Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO2 into valuable fuels and feedstocks offers a promising way for CO2 utilization. However, the commercialization is limited by the low productivity. Here, we report a strategy to enhance the productivity of CO2 electroreduction by improving diffusion of CO2 to the surface of catalysts using the porous organic cages (POCs) as an additive. It was noted that the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products could reach 76.1% with a current density of 1.7 A cm&#8208;2 when Cu&#8208;nanorod(nr)/CC3 (one of the POCs) was used, which were much higher than that using Cu&#8208;nr. Detailed studies demonstrated that the hydrophobic pores of CC3 can adsorb large amount of CO2 for the reaction, and the diffusion of CO2 in the CC3 to the nanocatalyst surface is easier than that in the liquid electrolyte. Thus, more CO2 molecules contact with the nanocatalysts in the presence of CC3, enhancing CO2 reduction and inhibting generation of H2.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This study provided an effective strategy to construct dual&#8208;atom sites by solid&#8208;solution alloying. A slow synthesis methodology was established for the solid solution preparations as dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts. The atomic&#8208;level homogeneous Pd  x  Rh  1&#8722;x  dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts were successfully synthesized over the whole composition range, as convinced by the X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscope&#8208;energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy mapping measurements. The challenging morphology formation in immiscible alloys was achieved by an energy controlling process as the octahedral Rh&#8208;rich alloys. The Pd  0.3  Rh  0.7  dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalyst had unique surface states to activate the key reactants of CO and NO in the complex three&#8208;way catalytic reactions, and it performed significantly better than pure Rh.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysine acylation plays pivotal roles in cell physiology, including DNA transcription and repair, signal transduction, immune defense, metabolism, and many other key cellular processes. Molecular mechanisms of dysregulated lysine acylation are closely involved in the pathophysiological progress of many human diseases, most notably cancers. In recent years, chemical biology tools have become instrumental in studying the function of post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs), identifying new &#8216;writers&#8217;, &#8216;erasers&#8217; and &#8216;readers&#8217;, and in targeted therapies. Here, we describe key developments in chemical biology approaches that have advanced the study of lysine acylation and its regulatory proteins (2016&#8208;2021). We further discuss the discovery of ligands (inhibitors and PROTACs) that are capable of targeting regulators of lysine acylation. Next, we discuss some current challenges of these chemical biology probes and suggest how chemists and biologists can utilize chemical probes with more discriminating capacity. Finally, we suggest some critical considerations in future studies of PTMs from our perspectives.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Enantioselective Desymmetrization of&#160;1,4&#8208;Dihydropyridines by C(sp3)&#8211;H&#160;Bromination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described herein is the enantioselective synthesis of Hantzsch&#8208;type 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (DHPs), which are frequently contained in pharmaceuticals. Readily available symmetrical 1,4&#8208;DHPs were used as substrates, and the methyl group at the 2&#8208; or 6&#8208;position of the 1,4&#8208;DHP was selectively monobrominated by desymmetrizing enantioselective bromination. The inert C&#8211;H bond was converted into a versatile C&#8211;Br bond, which guaranteed the modification of the chiral 1,4&#8208;DHP derivatives with high efficiency. Furthermore, axially chiral 4&#8208;aryl pyridines were accessible by central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Spectroscopy Unveils the Catalytic Role of Different Palladium Oxidation States in CO oxidation on Pd/CeO2 catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming at knowledge&#8208;driven design of novel metal&#8208;ceria catalysts for automotive exhaust abatement, current efforts mostly pertain to the synthesis and understanding of well&#8208;defined systems. In contrast, technical catalysts are often heterogenous in their metal speciation. Here, we unveiled rich structural dynamics of a conventional impregnated Pd/CeO2 catalyst during CO oxidation. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed presence of metallic and oxidic Pd states during the reaction. Using transient operando infrared spectroscopy, we probed the nature and reactivity of the surface intermediates involved in CO oxidation. We found that while low&#8208;temperature activity is associated with sub&#8208;oxidized and interfacial Pd sites, the reaction at elevated temperatures involves metallic Pd. These results highlight the utility of the multi&#8208;technique operando approach for establishing structure&#8208;activity relationships of technical catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustaining Electron Transfer Pathways Extends Biohybrid Photoelectrode Stability to Years</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploitation of natural photosynthetic enzymes in semi&#8208;artificial devices constitutes an attractive and potentially sustainable route for the conversion of solar energy into electricity and solar fuels. However, the stability of photosynthetic proteins after incorporation in a biohybrid architecture typically limits the operational lifetime of biophotoelectrodes to a few hours. Here, we demonstrate ways to greatly enhance the stability of a mesoporous electrode coated with the RC&#8208;LH1 photoprotein from  Rhodobacter sphaeroides.  By preserving electron transfer pathways, we extended operation under continuous high&#8208;light to 33 days, and operation after storage to over two years. Coupled with large photocurrents that reached peak values of 4.6 mA cm  &#8208;2  , the optimized biophotoelectrode produced a cumulative output of 86 C cm  &#8208;2  , the largest reported performance to date. Our results demonstrate that the factor limiting stability is the architecture surrounding the photoprotein, and that biohybrid sensors and photovoltaic devices with operational lifetimes of years are feasible.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic DNA Polymerization Can Be Expedited by Active Product Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sequence&#8208;specific hybridization of DNA fa cilitates its use as a building block for designer nanoscale structures and reaction networks that perform computations. However, the strong binding energy of Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing that underlies this specificity also causes the DNA de hybridization rate to depend sensitively on sequence length and temperature. This strong dependency imposes stringent constraints on the design of multi&#8208;step DNA reactions. Here we show how an ATP&#8208;dependent helicase, Rep&#8208;X, can drive specific dehybridization reactions at rates independent of sequence length, removing &#160; the constraints of equilibrium on DNA hybridization and dehybridization. To illustrate how this new capacity can speed up designed DNA reaction networks, we show that Rep&#8208;X extends the range of conditions where the primer exchange reaction, which catalytically adds a domain provided by a hairpin template to a DNA substrate, proceeds rapidly.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Cu&#8208;C Bond in Graphdiyne&#8208;Regulated Cu Single Atom Electrocatalyst for CO2 Reduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating intermediates through elaborating catalyst design to control reaction direction is crucial for promoting the selectivity of electrocatalytic CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;CH  4  . M&#8211;C (M = metal) bonds are particularly important for tuning multi&#8208;electron reaction, however, its construction in nanomaterials is challenging. Here, via rational design of in&#8208;situ anchoring Cu SAs (single atoms) on the unique platform graphdiyne, we firstly realize the construction of chemical bond Cu&#8208;C (GDY). In&#8208;situ Raman spectroelectrochemistry and DFT calculations confirm due to the fabrication of Cu&#8208;C bond, during CO  2  reduction, the formation of *OCHO intermediates is dominant rather than *COOH on Cu atoms, facilitating the formation of CH  4  . Therefore, we find that constructing Cu&#8208;C bond in Cu SAs/GDY can supply efficient charge transfer channel, but most importantly control the reaction intermediates and guide a more facile reaction pathway to CH  4  , thereby significantly boost its catalytic performance. This work provides new insights on enhancing the selectivity for CO  2  RR at atomic level.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we describe a DNA circuit&#8208;aided, origami nanodevice&#8208;based plasmonic system, which performs DNA&#8208;regulated, cascade amplification of faint chemical/biological signals. In this system, two gold&#8208;nanorods (GNRs) are co&#8208;assembled onto a DNA lock&#8208;containing, tweezer&#8208;like DNA origami template. Logic circuits serve as recognition and amplification elements for specific messengers, producing DNA keys for driving conformational changes of the plasmonic nanodevices. In the presence of input signals including nucleic acids, adenosines, chiral tyrosinamides or specific receptors expressed by tumor cells, the plasmonic nanodevices can be activated to perform dynamic structural motions, reporting robust responses  via  plasmonic circular dichroism (CD) spectral changes. This DNA nanodevice&#8208;based system provides a different design to enrich the strategies for constructing synthetic nanomachines, enabling the customized bottom&#8208;up nanostructure construction for sensitive biological signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of Carboxylic Acid Isosteres and Prodrugs for Inhibition of the Human SIRT5 Lysine Deacylase Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) is a protein lysine deacylase enzyme that regulates diverse biology by hydrolyzing &#949;&#8208;N&#8208;carboxyalkyllysine posttranslational modifications in the cell. Inhibition of SIRT5 has been linked to potential treatment of several cancers but potent compounds with activity in cells have been lacking. Here we developed mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors that incorporate isosteres of a carboxylic acid residue that is important for high&#8208;affinity binding to the enzyme active site. By masking of the tetrazole moiety of the most potent candidate from our initial SAR study, we achieved potent and cytoselective growth inhibition for the treatment of SIRT5&#8208;dependent leukemic cancer cell lines in culture. Thus, we provide an efficient, cellularly active small molecule that targets SIRT5, which can help elucidate its function and potential as a future drug target. This work shows that masked biosisosteres of carboxylic acids are viable chemical motifs for the development of inhibitors that target mitochondrial enzymes, which may have applications beyond the sirtuin field.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Four&#8208;Electron Redox Systems Based on Bipyridine and Phenanthroline Carbene Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel organic redox systems that display multistage redox behaviour are highly sought&#8208;after for a series of applications such as organic batteries or electrochromic materials. Here we describe a simple strategy to transfer well&#8208;known two&#8208;electron redox active bipyridine and phenanthroline architectures into novel strongly reducing four&#8208;electron redox systems featuring fully reversible redox events with up to five stable oxidation states. We give spectroscopic and structural insight into the changes involved in the redox&#8208;events and present characterization data on all isolated oxidation states. The redox&#8208;systems feature strong UV&#8208;vis/NIR polyelectrochromic properties such as distinct strong NIR absorptions in the mixed valence states. Two&#8208;electron charge&#8208;discharge cycling studies indicate high electrochemical stability at strongly negative potentials, rendering the new redox architectures promising lead structures for multi&#8208;electron anolyte materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating unexpected high charge&#8208;carrier mobility and low&#8208;threshold lasing action in an organic semiconductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating high charge&#8208;carrier mobility and low&#8208;threshold lasing action in an organic semiconductor is crucial for the realization of electrically pumped laser, but remains a great challenge. Herein, we present an organic semiconductor, named as 2,7&#8208;naphthyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (LD&#8208;2),which shows unexpected high charge&#8208;carrier mobility of 2.7 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  and low&#8208;threshold lasing characters of 9.43 &#181;J cm  &#8208;2  and 9.93 &#181;J cm  &#8208;2  and high&#8208;quality factor (Q) of 2131 and 1684 at emission peaks of 420 and 443 nm, respectively. More deep theoretical calculation and photophysical data analysis demonstrate that large intermolecular transfer integral of 10.36 ~ 45.16 meV together with a fast radiative transition rate of 8.0&#215;10  8  s  &#8208;1  is responsible for the achievement of superior integrated optoelectronic properties in LD&#8208;2 crystal. These optoelectronic performances of LD&#8208;2 are among of the highest reported low&#8208;threshold lasing organic semiconductors with efficient charge transport, suggesting its promising for research of EPOLs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A remote C(sp  3  )&#8211;H bond asymmetric borylation of unactivated alkenes has been achieved for the first time by bimetallic relay catalysis. The reaction proceeded through reversible and consecutive &#946;&#8208;H elimination/olefin insertion promoted by  in&#8208;situ  generated CoH species, followed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric protoboration. The use of this synergistic Co/Cu catalysis protocol allowed the enantioselective protoboration of various unactivated terminal alkenes, internal alkenes, as well as unrefined mixture of olefin isomers at the distal less&#8208;reactive &#946;&#8208;position, leading to chiral organoboronates.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia with Copper Supported Rhodium Cluster and Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) provides a promising solution for restoring the imbalance in the global nitrogen cycle while enabling a sustainable and decentralized route to source ammonia. Here, we demonstrate a novel electrocatalyst for NITRR consisting of Rh clusters and single&#8208;atoms dispersed onto Cu nanowires (NWs), which delivers a partial current density of 162 mA cm&#8722;2 for NH3 production and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 93% at &#8722;0.2 V vs. RHE. The highest ammonia yield rate reached a record value of 1.27 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Detailed investigations by electron spin resonance, in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and density functional theory modeling suggest that the high activity originates from the synergistic catalytic cooperation between Rh and Cu sites, whereby adsorbed hydrogen on Rh sites transfer to vicinal *NO intermediate species adsorbed on Cu promoting the hydrogenation and ammonia formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Generation of Hydrogen Peroxide and Formate by an Organic Polymer Dots Photocatalyst in Alkaline Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photocatalyst comprised of binary organic polymer dots (Pdots) was prepared. The Pdots were constructed from poly(9,9&#8208;dioctylfluorene&#8208;  alt  &#8208;benzothiadiazole), as an electron donor, and 1&#8208;[3&#8208;(methoxycarbonyl)propyl]&#8208;1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;[6.6]C  61  , as an electron acceptor. The photocatalyst produces H  2  O  2  in alkaline conditions (1 M KOH) with a production rate of up to 188 mmol h  &#8208;1  g  &#8208;1  . The external quantum efficiencies were 30% (5 min) and 14% (75 min) at 450 nm. Furthermore, photo&#8208;oxidation of methanol by Pdots, followed by a disproportionation reaction and an oxidation reaction, produced the high&#8208;value chemical&#160;formate. On the basis of various spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements, the photophysical processes of the system were studied in detail and a reaction mechanism was proposed.</dc:description>

Furthermore, photo-oxidation of methanol by Pdots, followed by a disproportionation reaction and an oxidation reaction, produced the high-value chemical&#160;formate. On the basis of various spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements, the photophysical processes of the system were studied in detail and a reaction mechanism was proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;binary Encoded Nucleic Acid Barcodes Directly Readable by a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely simple molecular barcoding strategy is proposed based on self&#8208;assembly of synthetic DNA oligomers and direct nanopore decoding. The composition of the barcode probe is highly programmable, and in principle 14n unique step&#8208;shaped barcode patterns can be generated without nanopore sequencing. Different protein and microRNA targets were identified using this strategy, showing its generality in single molecule sensing.







Abstract
A large collection of unique molecular barcodes is useful in the simultaneous sensing or screening of molecular analytes. Though the sequence of DNA has been widely applied to encode for molecular barcodes, decoding of these barcodes is normally assisted by sequencing. We here demonstrate a barcode system based solely on self&#8208;assembly of synthetic nucleic acids and direct nanopore decoding. Each molecular barcode is composed of &#8220;n&#8221; distinct information nodes in a non&#8208;binary manner and can be sequentially scanned and decoded by a Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) nanopore. Nanopore events containing step&#8208;shaped features were consistently reported. 14 unique information nodes were developed which in principle could encode for 14n unique molecular barcodes in a barcode containing &#8220;n&#8221; information nodes. These barcode probes were adapted to detect different antibody proteins or cancer&#8208;related microRNAs, suggesting their immediate application in a wide variety of sensing applications.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Fluorescent Monitoring of Kinetically Controlled Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly of Atom&#8208;Precise Cu8 Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within the scheme of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), optical&#8208;engineering was performed for real&#8208;time monitoring of the self&#8208;assembly process of Cu8a with various kinetic long&#8208;lived intermediates, leading to a structure&#8211;property relationship being established.







Abstract
Kinetically stable and long&#8208;lived intermediates are crucial in monitoring the progress and understanding of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of diverse aggregated structures with collective functions. Herein, the complex dynamics of an atomically precise CuI nanocluster [Cu8(tBuC6H4S)8(PPh3)4] (Cu8a) is systematically investigated. Remarkably, by monitoring the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and electron microscopy of the kinetically stable intermediates in real time, the directed self&#8208;assembly (DSA) process of Cu8a is deduced. The polymorphism and different emission properties of Cu NCs aggregates were successfully captured, allowing the structure&#8211;optical property relationship to be established. More importantly, the utilization of a mathematical &#8220;permutation and combination&#8221; ideology by introducing a heterogeneous luminescent agent of a carbon dot (CD) to Cu8a aggregates enriches the &#8220;visualization&#8221; fluorescence window, which offers great potential in real time application for optical sensing of materials.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Microcapsules for On&#8208;Demand Drug Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic fabrication (left) is used to prepare a two aqueous phase microcapsule (right), which releases a model drug payload on demand in response to focused ultrasound actuation.







Abstract
Traditional implanted drug delivery systems cannot easily change their release profile in real time to respond to physiological changes. Here we present a microfluidic aqueous two&#8208;phase system to generate microcapsules that can release drugs on demand as triggered by focused ultrasound (FUS). The biphasic microcapsules are made of hydrogels with an outer phase of mixed molecular weight (MW) poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate that mitigates premature payload release and an inner phase of high MW dextran with payload that breaks down in response to FUS. Compound release from microcapsules could be triggered as desired; 0.4&#8197;&#956;g of payload was released across 16 on&#8208;demand steps over days. We detected broadband acoustic signals amidst low heating, suggesting inertial cavitation as a key mechanism for payload release. Overall, FUS&#8208;responsive microcapsules are a biocompatible and wirelessly triggerable structure for on&#8208;demand drug delivery over days to weeks.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes via Catalytic Rhodium to Gold(III) Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic method for the straightforward synthesis of cyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) complexes is reported via an unprecedented, redox&#8208;neutral Rh&#8208;to&#8208;AuIII transmetalation. A rate&#8208;determining transfer of the C ligand followed by the subsequent incorporation of the N donor delivers the monocyclometalated (C^N) gold(III) species.







Abstract
A catalytic method to synthesize a broad array of cyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) complexes is reported here. An unprecedented Rh&#8208;to&#8208;AuIII transmetalation allows the facile transfer of (C^N) ligands between these two metals in a redox&#8208;neutral process. The reaction employs commercially available precursors and proceeds under mild and environmentally benign conditions. Both experimental and computational studies support a multistep transmetalation from rhodium to gold as the underlying mechanism for these transformations. This process involves first, a rate&#8208;determining transfer of the C ligand followed by the subsequent incorporation of the N donor to form the monocyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) species.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Semiconductor Anodes for Ultrastable and Site&#8208;Selective Upconversion Photoinduced Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Pt and n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Ir exhibit high photovoltages and record stabilities in operation (up to 35&#8197;h) for the generation of intense anti&#8208;Stokes photoinduced electrochemiluminescence onto the whole surface of the metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (MIS) photoanode or at a specifically&#8208;chosen location. These results provide solutions for overcoming the instability that has hampered the practical application of upconversion photoinduced electrochemiluminescence (PECL).







Abstract
Photoinduced electrochemiluminescence (PECL) allows the electrochemically assisted conversion of low&#8208;energy photons into high&#8208;energy photons at an electrode surface. This concept is expected to have important implications, however, it is dramatically limited by the stability of the surface, impeding future developments. Here, a series of metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (MIS) junctions, using photoactive n&#8208;type Si (n&#8208;Si) as a light absorber covered by a few&#8208;nanometer&#8208;thick protective SiOx/metal (SiOx/M, with M=Ru, Pt, and Ir) overlayers are investigated for upconversion PECL of the model co&#8208;reactant system involving the simultaneous oxidation of tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) and tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine. We show that n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Pt and n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Ir exhibit high photovoltages and record stabilities in operation (35&#8197;h for n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Ir) for the generation of intense PECL with an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 218&#8197;nm. We also demonstrate that these surfaces can be employed for spatially localized PECL. These unprecedented performances are extremely promising for future applications of PECL.

&lt;p&gt;Photoinduced electrochemiluminescence (PECL) allows the electrochemically assisted conversion of low-energy photons into high-energy photons at an electrode surface. This concept is expected to have important implications, however, it is dramatically limited by the stability of the surface, impeding future developments. Here, a series of metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) junctions, using photoactive &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-type Si (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-Si) as a light absorber covered by a few-nanometer-thick protective SiO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/metal (SiO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/M, with M=Ru, Pt, and Ir) overlayers are investigated for upconversion PECL of the model co-reactant system involving the simultaneous oxidation of tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) and tri-n-propylamine. We show that &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-Si/SiO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/Pt and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-Si/SiO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/Ir exhibit high photovoltages and record stabilities in operation (35&#8197;h for &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-Si/SiO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/Ir) for the generation of intense PECL with an anti-Stokes shift of 218&#8197;nm. We also demonstrate that these surfaces can be employed for spatially localized PECL. These unprecedented performances are extremely promising for future applications of PECL.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ratiometric and Colorimetric Optical Thermometers Using Emissive Dimeric and Trimeric {[Au(SCN)2]&#8722;}n Moieties Generated in d&#8211;f Heterometallic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The {[AuI(SCN)2]&#8722;}2 and {[AuI(SCN)2]&#8722;}3 ions were incorporated in two different supramolecular matrices with GdIII and YIII. The resulting materials exhibit characteristic Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au vibrational peaks investigated by ultralow frequency Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The formation of Au2 and Au3 moieties yields strong photoluminescence with rich color tunability, providing high&#8208;performance colorimetric and ratiometric thermometer abilities.







Abstract
Gold complexes can generate excimers ([Au2]&#8594;[Au2]*) and exciplexes ([Au3]&#8594;[Au3]*) with light excitation. Four GdIII and YIII complexes were assembled with dimeric {[Au(SCN)2]&#8722;}2 and trimeric {[Au(SCN)2]&#8722;}3 bis(thiocyanato)gold(I) counterions. The vibrational signature associated with the Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au vibrational mode was probed with ultralow frequency (ULF) Raman spectroscopy as a function of temperature. Emission spectroscopy was used to explore photophysical properties. Two broad features in the high&#8208; and low&#8208;energy regions were associated with the fluorescence and phosphorescence of the gold entities, respectively. Temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence measurements showed that the emission color can be tuned from blue to green via cyan and white. Hence, these complexes can act as colorimetric thermometers. Additionally, a ratiometric thermal sensing ability was incorporated with high sensitivity up to 5&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 in the cryogenic temperature range.

         <title>Tandem Macrolactone Synthesis: Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Exiguolide by a Macrocyclization/Transannular Pyran Cyclization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic tandem reaction integrating Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement, macrocyclic ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition was developed to access tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing macrolactones in a single step from readily available linear precursors. To illustrate the feasibility of the synthetic strategy, an antitumor marine macrolide, (&#8722;)&#8208;exiguolide, was synthesized in just 13 steps from a commercially available compound.







Abstract
Tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing macrolactones were synthesized by integrating Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement, macrocyclic ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition under gold and ruthenium catalysis. Single&#8208;step access to a variety of 14&#8208; to 20&#8208;membered macrolactones containing a tetrahydropyran ring was possible from readily available linear precursors in good yields and with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. A 13&#8208;step synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;exiguolide, an anticancer marine macrolide, showcased the feasibility of our tandem reaction sequence for macrolactone synthesis and also demonstrated the power of transannular reactions for rapid assembly of the tetrahydropyran rings of the target natural product.

         <title>An Isolable Vinylidene ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide: Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first isolation and comprehensive characterization of a vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM), including crystallographic analysis, is described. The disturbed aromaticity of the VQM causes its high reactivity, making it capable of asymmetric dearomatization of an electron&#8208;deficient aryl group. This study paves an avenue for the direct application of VQMs as starting materials.







Abstract
Commonly, an elusive intermediate is generated from a precursor and then trapped and consumed in a reaction. Vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) have been demonstrated as transient axially chiral intermediates in asymmetric catalysis due to their orthogonal &#960;&#8208;bonds forming an allene motif. The current understanding of VQMs is primarily based on time&#8208;resolved absorption, trapping experiments and computational studies. Herein, we report the first isolation and comprehensive characterization of a VQM, including crystallographic analysis. The disturbed aromaticity of the VQM led to its high reactivity as an electrophile or a 4&#960;&#8208;component capable of asymmetric dearomatization of an electron&#8208;deficient phenyl group. Notably, the VQM could be isolated in enantiomerically enriched form, and the subsequent transformation was stereospecific, indicating that the generation of the VQM was involved in the enantiodetermining step. This study paves the way for the direct application of VQMs as starting materials.

         <title>Highly Stable and Reactive Platinum Single Atoms on Oxygen Plasma&#8208;Functionalized CeO2 Surfaces: Nanostructuring and Peroxo Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pre&#8208;treatment of the ceria (CeO2) surface with oxygen plasma assists the formation of highly dense and stable Pt single atoms resistant to sintering under CO oxidation conditions. The effect is assigned to plasma&#8208;induced oxide nanostructuring and the formation of surface peroxo species which favor single&#8208;atom metal adsorption. This approach can be utilized for the preparation of stable single&#8208;atom catalysts with a high density of active sites.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed precious metals on oxide supports have recently become increasingly interesting catalytic materials. Nonetheless, their non&#8208;trivial preparation and limited thermal and environmental stability constitutes an issue for their potential applications. Here we demonstrate that an oxygen plasma pre&#8208;treatment of the ceria (CeO2) surface serves to anchor Pt single atoms, making them active and resistant towards sintering in the CO oxidation reaction. Through a combination of experimental results obtained on well&#8208;defined CeO2 films and theory, we show that the O2 plasma causes surface nanostructuring and the formation of surface peroxo (O22&#8722;) species, favoring the uniform and dense distribution of isolated strongly bonded Pt2+ atoms. The promotional effect of the plasma treatment was further demonstrated on powder Pt/CeO2 catalysts. We believe that plasma functionalization can be applied to other metal/oxide systems to achieve tunable and stable catalysts with a high density of active sites.

         <title>K3SbS4 as a Potassium Superionic Conductor with Low Activation Energy for K&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium superionic conductor with low activation energy: W&#8208;doped K3SbS4 possesses a two&#8208;dimensional K migration pathway and a low activation energy of 0.27&#8197;eV. Among them, K2.92Sb0.92W0.08S4 exhibits the highest conductivity of 1.4&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 40&#8201;&#176;C, which is among the best reported potassium&#8208;ion conductors at ambient temperature and is then used in K&#8722;S batteries to block the polysulfide shuttle.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state K&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are key elements to address the current problems in K secondary batteries. Here, we report a sulfide&#8208;based K&#8208;ion conductor K3SbS4 with a low&#8208;activation energy of 0.27&#8197;eV. W&#8208;doped K3&#8722;xSb1&#8722;xWxS4 (x=0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10 and 0.12) compounds were also explored for increasing vacancy concentrations and improving ionic conductivity. Among them, K2.92Sb0.92W0.08S4 exhibits the highest conductivity of 1.4&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 40&#8201;&#176;C, which is among the best reported potassium&#8208;ion conductors at ambient temperature. In addition, K2.92Sb0.92W0.08S4 is electrochemically stable with long&#8208;chained potassium polysulfide of K2Sx. A room&#8208;temperature solid potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8722;S) battery system has therefore been successfully demonstrated, which is the first K&#8722;S battery prototype using non&#8208;commercial inorganic&#8208;based electrolyte to block the polysulfide shuttle.

         <title>Distal Ruthenaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Bromination with Aqueous HBr</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrochemical transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization has been accomplished, affording the positionally selective bromination product in an undivided cell by the catalysis of readily available RuCl3&#8901;3&#8201;H2O with aqueous HBr as the brominating agent.







Abstract
While electrochemical ortho&#8208;selective C&#8722;H activations are well established, distal C&#8722;H activations continue to be underdeveloped. In contrast, we herein describe the electrochemical meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization. The remote C&#8722;H bromination was accomplished in an undivided cell by RuCl3&#8901;3&#8201;H2O with aqueous HBr. The electrohalogenation proceeded under exogenous ligand&#8208; and electrolyte&#8208;free conditions. Notably, pyrazolylarenes were meta&#8208;selectively brominated at the benzenoid moiety, rather than on the electron&#8208;rich pyrazole ring for the first time. Mechanistic studies were suggestive of an initial ruthenacycle formation, and a subsequent ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer (LLHT) process to liberate the brominated product.

         <title>Transforming Dyes into Fluorophores: Exciton&#8208;Induced Emission with Chain&#8208;like Oligo&#8208;BODIPY Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dark BODIPY dyes are able to fully recover their fluorescence properties when linked via a flexible ethylene tether. Various excited state deactivation channels are shown to become drastically mitigated by formation of stable excitons within conformationally unstable, discrete superstructures. This study might open doors to a novel assay for detection and visualization of spatial, molecular encounters.







Abstract
Herein we present a systematic study demonstrating to which extent exciton formation can amplify fluorescence based on a series of ethylene&#8208;bridged oligo&#8208;BODIPYs. A set of non&#8208; and weakly fluorescent BODIPY motifs was selected and transformed into discrete, chain&#8208;like oligomers by linkage via a flexible ethylene tether. The prepared superstructures constitute excitonically active entities with non&#8208;conjugated, Coulomb&#8208;coupled oscillators. The non&#8208;radiative deactivation channels of Internal Conversion (IC), also combined with an upstream reductive Photoelectron Transfer (rPET) and Intersystem Crossing (ISC) were addressed at the monomeric state and the evolution of fluorescence and (non&#8208;)radiative decay rates studied along the oligomeric series. We demonstrate that a &#8220;masked&#8221; fluorescence can be fully reactivated irrespective of the imposed conformational rigidity. This work challenges the paradigm that a collective fluorescence enhancement is limited to sterically induced motional restrictions.

         <title>Leveraging Electron&#8208;Deficient Iminium Intermediates in a General Synthesis of Valuable Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of aminals as precursors for iminium ion has been limited to methylene derivatives, thus hampering its broader use. By employing electron&#8208;deficient iminium ions an obvious hurdle of the methodology is overcome, whilst generating highly desirable motifs. This broad concept is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage amination of quinine into a biologically interesting new analogue.







Abstract
The development of reactions converting alkenes and alkynes into valuable building blocks remains one of the main goals of synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present the leveraging of highly electron&#8208;deficient iminium ions, rare and fleeting intermediates, into a general amine synthesis. This enables the preparation of amines bearing e.g. valuable &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl moieties under mild conditions. This broad concept is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage amination of quinine into a biologically interesting new analogue.

         <title>Building a Beyond Concentrated Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Anode&#8208;Free Rechargeable Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly aggregated ether electrolyte is rationally constructed by introducing a 3A zeolite molecular sieve film. Benefitting from the highly aggregated electrolyte configuration, it enables a dramatically improved oxidative stability. Under the extremely harsh anode&#8208;free conditions, the high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free Na battery configuration has an ultrahigh energy density of 369&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1 for 4.0&#8197;V class cathodes.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost and scalable sodium ion (Na&#8208;ion) batteries serve as an ideal alternative to the current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. To compensate for the shortage of energy density, the most accessible solution is developing a high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free configuration comprising a lightweight Al current collector on the anode and a high&#8208;voltage sodiumized cathode. However, it imposes stringent Na reversibility and high&#8208;voltage stability requirements on the electrolyte. A 3A zeolite molecular sieve film is rationally designed, and a highly aggregated solvation structure is constructed through the size effect. It suppresses the trace but continuous oxidative decomposition and extends the oxidative stability to 4.5&#8197;V without sacrificing the Na reversibility of the anode (99.91&#8201;%). Thus, we can make anode&#8208;free cells with high energy density of 369 and 372&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1 for 4.0 and 4.25&#8197;V class cells, respectively. Furthermore, this strategy enables a long lifespan (250&#8197;cycles) for 4.0&#8197;V&#8208;class anode&#8208;free cells.

Thus, we can make anode-free cells with high energy density of 369 and 372&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for 4.0 and 4.25&#8197;V class cells, respectively. Furthermore, this strategy enables a long lifespan (250&#8197;cycles) for 4.0&#8197;V-class anode-free cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Heterogeneous Palladium Catalyst for the Polymerization of Olefins Prepared by Halide Abstraction Using Surface R3Si+ Species</title>

A silylium&#8208;like ion supported on silica ionizes a Pd&#8722;Cl complex by chloride abstraction to generate a very active catalyst for (co&#8208;)polymerization reactions.







Abstract
The silylium&#8208;like surface species [iPr3Si][(RFO)3Al&#8722;OSi&#8801;)] activates (N^N)Pd(CH3)Cl (N^N=Ar&#8722;N=CMeMeC=N&#8722;Ar, Ar=2,6&#8208;bis(diphenylmethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzene) by chloride ion abstraction to form [(N^N)Pd&#8722;CH3][(RFO)3Al&#8722;OSi&#8801;)] (1). A combination of FTIR, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, and reactions with CO or vinyl chloride establish that 1 shows similar reactivity patterns as (N^N)Pd(CH3)Cl activated with Na[B(ArF)4]. Multinuclear 13C{27Al} RESPDOR and 1H{19F} S&#8208;REDOR experiments are consistent with a weakly coordinated ion&#8208;pair between (N^N)Pd&#8722;CH3+ and [(RFO)3Al&#8722;OSi&#8801;)]. 1 catalyzes the polymerization of ethylene with similar activities as [(N^N)Pd&#8722;CH3]+ in solution and incorporates up to 0.4&#8201;% methyl acrylate in copolymerization reactions. 1 produces polymers with significantly higher molecular weight than the solution catalyst, and generates the highest molecular weight polymers currently reported in copolymerization reactions of ethylene and methylacrylate.

         <title>Functionalization and Hydrogenation of Carbon Chains Derived from CO**

Selective reactions that combine H2, CO and organic electrophiles (aldehyde, ketones, isocyanide) to form hydrogenated C3 and C4 carbon chains are reported.







Abstract
Selective reactions that combine H2, CO and organic electrophiles (aldehyde, ketones, isocyanide) to form hydrogenated C3 and C4 carbon chains are reported. These reactions proceed by CO homologation mediated by [W(CO)6] and an aluminum(I) reductant, followed by functionalization and hydrogenation of the chain ends. A combination of kinetics (rates, KIEs) and DFT calculations has been used to gain insight into a key step which involves hydrogenation of a metallocarbene intermediate. These findings expand the extremely small scope of systems that combine H2 and CO to make well&#8208;defined products with complete control over chain length and functionality.

         <title>Enantioselective Intermolecular C&#8722;H Silylation of Heteroarenes for the Synthesis of Acyclic Si&#8208;Stereogenic Silanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation of heteroarenes for the synthesis of acyclic silicon&#8208;stereogenic heteroarylsilanes has been developed. This process proceeds via a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct intermolecular dehydrogenative Si&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling, giving access to a variety of optically active silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereocontrol.







Abstract
Intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation for the synthesis of acyclic silanes bearing a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center in one enantiomeric form remains unknown to date. Herein, we report the first enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation of heteroarenes for the synthesis of acyclic silicon&#8208;stereogenic heteroarylsilanes. This process undergoes a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct intermolecular dehydrogenative Si&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling, giving access to a variety of acyclic heteroarylated silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes, including bis&#8208;Si&#8208;stereogenic silanes, in decent yields with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereo&#8208;control, which significantly enlarge the chemical space of the optically active silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes.

         <title>4&#8208;Bromo&#8208;Butyric Acid&#8208;Assisted In Situ Passivation Strategy for Superstable All&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskite CsPbX3 Quantum Dots in Polar Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A crucial challenge is to develop an in situ passivation strategy for perovskite CsPbX  3  (CPX, X = Cl, Br, and I) quantum dots (QDs) to improve their stability in polar solvents and simultaneously maintaining their optical performance without using complicated organics. Here, we describe a facile method to significantly improve the stability of the CPX QDs via in situ crystallization with combined effects of 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;butyric acid (BBA) and oleylamine (OLA) in polar solvents and also propose a possible fundamental mechanism. Monodispersed CsPbBr  3  (CPB) QDs obtained in water show high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 86.4% and their PL features of CPB QDs have no significant change after being dispersed in water for 96 h&#65292;which implies that their structures are unchanged. The results provide a viable design strategy to synthesize all&#8208;inorganic perovskites CPX QDs with strong stability against the attack of polar solvents and shed more light on their surface chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrawide Bandgap and Outstanding Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response by a Fluorine Enrichment Strategy at a Transition&#8208;Metal Oxyfluoride Nonlinear Optical Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials has been hindered by competing microstructure requirements:&#160;the need to simultaneously engineer a large hyperpolarizability (a large second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG)) and a wide HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (a wide bandgap). Herein, a non&#8208;centrosymmetric transition&#8208;metal (TM) oxyfluoride K5(NbOF4)(NbF7)2 (KNOF) with an extremely high F/O ratio is constructed in high yield. KNOF exhibits an extremely wide bandgap (5.88 eV) and a strong powder SHG response (4.0 &#215; KH2PO4) &#8211; both being the largest values for TM&#8208;centered oxyfluorides &#8211; as well as a birefringence sufficient for applications. The dominant roles of the partially fluorinated [NbO2F4] and totally fluorinated [NbF7] groups in achieving the enlarged bandgap in KNOF have been clarified by first&#8208;principles calculations. Our results suggest that maximizing the fluorine content of oxyfluorides may unlock the promise of short&#8208;wavelength&#8208;transparent materials with exceptional NLO performance.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of sulfides has been widely studied because this functional subunit is prevalent in biomolecules and pharmaceuticals, as well as being a useful synthetic platform for further elaboration. Thus, various methods to build C&#8211;S bonds have been developed, but typically they require the use of precious metals or harsh conditions. Electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex photoactivation strategies have emerged as versatile and sustainable ways to achieve C&#8211;S bond formation, avoiding challenges associated with previous methods. This work describes an open&#8208;to&#8208;air, photoinduced, site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H thioetherification from readily available reagents via EDA complex formation, tolerating a wide range of different functional groups. Moreover, C(sp  2  )&#8211;halogen bonds remain intact using this protocol, allowing late&#8208;stage installation of the sulfide motif in various bioactive scaffolds, while allowing yet further modification through more traditional C&#8208;X bond cleavage protocols.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although proton&#8208;ion batteries have received considerable attention owing to their reliability, safety, toxin&#8208;free nature, and low cost, their development remains in the early stages because of lacking proper electrolytes and cathodes for facilitating a high output voltage and stable cycle performance. We present a novel cathode based on active nitrogen centre, which provides a flat discharge plateau at 1 V with a capacity of 115 mAh g  &#8208;1  and excellent stability. Moreover, a quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte was developed to overcome the issue of corrosion, broaden the potential window of the electrolyte, and prevent the active material from dissolving. While using the unique as&#8208;developed electrolyte, the newly designed cathode retained 89.67% of its original capacity after 2000 cycles. Finally, we demonstrated the excellent cycle performance of the as&#8208;developed metal&#8208;free, flexible, soft&#8208;packed battery. Notably, even when a portion of the battery was cut off, it continued to function normally.</dc:description>

However, multiplexed imaging with NIR&#8208;II excitation and emission has been hampered by the limited chemical strategy to develop bright fluorophores with tunable absorption in this spectral regime  . Herein, we developed a series of heptamethine cyanines (HCs) with varied absorption/emission maxima spanning from 1100 to 1600 nm through a physical organic approach.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;2D Bilayer Surface Passivation for High Efficiency Narrow Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TEASCN (2&#8208;thiopheneethylamine thiocyanate) was synthesized to construct a bilayer structure on a Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite surface, which can passivate perovskite and ensure effective carriers transfer, enabling the device to reach a certified efficiency of 21.1&#8201;%. The mechanism for the growth of the uniform bilayer structure is revealed by simulation based on density functional theory.







Abstract
The combination of comprehensive surface passivation and effective interface carriers transfer plays a critical role in high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells. A 2D structure is an important approach for surface passivation of perovskite film, however, its large band gap could compromise carrier transfer. Herein, we synthesize a new molecule 2&#8208;thiopheneethylamine thiocyanate (TEASCN) for the construction of bilayer quasi&#8208;2D structure precisely on a tin&#8208;lead mixed perovskite surface. This bilayer structure can passivate the perovskite surface and ensure effective carriers transfer simultaneously. As a result, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of the device is increased without sacrificing short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc), giving rise to a high certified efficiency from a credible third&#8208;party certification of narrow band gap perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, theoretical simulation indicates that the inclusion of TEASCN makes the bilayer structure thermodynamically more stable, which provides a strategy to tailor the number of layers of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite structures.

         <title>A Nanopore Sensing Assay Resolves Cascade Reactions in a Multienzyme System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanopore sensing assay is developed to resolve cascade reactions of an artificial three&#8208;enzyme system. In a confined environment such as liposomes, substrate&#8208;channelling effects are observed between two sets of the three enzymes.







Abstract
Enzymatic cascade reactions are widely used to synthesize complex molecules from simple precursors. The major underlying mechanism of cascade reactions is substrate channelling, where intermediates of different enzymatic steps are not in equilibrium with the bulk solution. Here, we report a nanopore sensing assay that allows accurate quantification of all the reaction intermediates and the product of an artificial three&#8208;enzyme system. A DNA&#8211;peptide complex is used as the initial substrate which undergoes sequential enzymatic cleavages in solution. All the temporal changes of the intermediates and product can be obtained through nanopore translocation recordings. Furthermore, we find that in a confined environment such as liposome, substrate channelling occurs between two sets of the three enzymes. Our results demonstrate a novel and powerful approach to determine and quantify substrate channelling effects, which is potentially useful for designing and evaluating multienzyme systems.

         <title>Regio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208;, and Enantioselective Decarboxylative Hydro&#8208;aminoalkylation of Dienol Ethers Enabled by Dual Palladium/Pho&#8208;toredox Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel decarboxylative hydroaminoalkylation (HAA) reaction of N&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;amino acids with dienol ethers enabled by a photoredox/palladium dual catalytic system is presented. With the developed method, a broad variety of substrates was deployed to deliver vicinal amino tertiary ethers in good to excellent yields with excellent diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that this transformation proceeds through a reversible hydropalladation of 1,3&#8208;dienes.







Abstract
Intermolecular photocatalytic hydroaminoalkylation (HAA) of alkenes have emerged as a powerful method for the construction of alkyl amines. Although there are some studies aiming at stereoselective photocatalytic HAA reactions, the alkenes are limited to electrophilic alkenes. Herein, we report a highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective HAA of electron&#8208;rich dienol ethers and &#945;&#8208;amino radicals derived from &#945;&#8208;amino acids using a unified photoredox and palladium catalytic system. This decarboxylative 1,2&#8208;Markovnikov addition enables the construction of vicinal amino tertiary ethers with high levels of regio&#8208; (up to &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 rr), diastereo&#8208; (up to &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr), and enantioselectivity control (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies support a reversible hydropalladation as a key step.

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Arylindoles via Atroposelective Cyclization of Ynamides Catalyzed by Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective cyclization of ynamides is disclosed, which represents the first metal&#8208;free protocol for the construction of axially chiral compounds from ynamides. This method enables the practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of valuable N&#8208;arylindoles in excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
In recent years, asymmetric catalysis of ynamides has attracted much attention, but these reactions mostly constructed central chirality, except for a few examples on the synthesis of axially chiral compounds which exclusively relied on noble&#8208;metal catalysis. Herein, a facile access to axially chiral N&#8208;heterocycles enabled by chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of ynamides is disclosed, which represents the first metal&#8208;free protocol for the construction of axially chiral compounds from ynamides. This method allows the practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of valuable N&#8208;arylindoles in excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities. Moreover, organocatalysts and ligands based on such axially chiral N&#8208;arylindole skeletons are demonstrated to be applicable to asymmetric catalysis.

A silicon analogue of a bicyclo[1.1.0]butane radical anion was synthesized. This compound exhibits an extremely elongated bridgehead Si&#8722;Si bond (3.0638(8)&#8197;&#197;) and a near&#8208;IR absorption (&#955;max=922&#8197;nm) in solution attributed to the HOMO&#8594;SOMO [&#960;(Si&#8722;Si)&#8594;&#960;*(Si&#8722;Si)] transition. Furthermore, this silicon radical anion presents a new bonding motif which appears to be the first example of a &#8220;&#960;&#8208;type 3e&#8208;2c&#8208;bonded species&#8221;.







Abstract

Herein, we report the synthesis of the first stable &#960;&#8208;type 3e&#8208;2c&#8208;bonded species, a silicon analogue of a bicyclo[1.1.0]butane radical anion.

         <title>Modification of Nitrate Ion Enables Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of NO3&#8722; is achieved by connecting NO3&#8722; to an ether&#8208;based moiety. The broken resonance structure of &#8722;NO3 improves its reducibility compared with NO3&#8722;. The decomposition of &#8722;NO3 forms a LiNxOy&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and induces uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
The lifespan of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is hindered by heterogeneous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The rational design of electrolytes is strongly considered to obtain uniform SEI in working batteries. Herein, a modification of nitrate ion (NO3&#8722;) is proposed and validated to improve the homogeneity of the SEI in practical LMBs. NO3&#8722; is connected to an ether&#8208;based moiety to form isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) to break the resonance structure of NO3&#8722; and improve the reducibility. The decomposition of non&#8208;resonant &#8722;NO3 in ISDN enriches SEI with abundant LiNxOy and induces uniform lithium deposition. Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with ISDN additives deliver a capacity retention of 83.7&#8201;% for 100 cycles compared with rapid decay with LiNO3 after 55 cycles. Moreover, lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells with ISDN additives provide a specific energy of 319&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and undergo 20 cycles. This work provides a realistic reference in designing additives to modify the SEI for stabilizing LMBs.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The decomposition of &#8722;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; forms a LiN&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and induces uniform Li deposition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lifespan of high-energy-density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is hindered by heterogeneous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The rational design of electrolytes is strongly considered to obtain uniform SEI in working batteries. Herein, a modification of nitrate ion (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) is proposed and validated to improve the homogeneity of the SEI in practical LMBs. NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is connected to an ether-based moiety to form isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) to break the resonance structure of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and improve the reducibility. The decomposition of non-resonant &#8722;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in ISDN enriches SEI with abundant LiN&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; and induces uniform lithium deposition. Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with ISDN additives deliver a capacity retention of 83.7&#8201;% for 100 cycles compared with rapid decay with LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; after 55 cycles. Moreover, lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells with ISDN additives provide a specific energy of 319&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and undergo 20 cycles. This work provides a realistic reference in designing additives to modify the SEI for stabilizing LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gadolinium Changes the Local Electron Densities of Nickel 3d Orbitals for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of Gd atoms into a Ni&#8208;based catalyst readily changes local electron densities of the Ni 3d orbitals and strengthens the electronic activity. The resulting Ni&#8208;Gd&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon black electrocatalyst achieves high selectivity, large current density and outstanding stability in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Generally, in terms of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, single&#8208;atom catalysts show high selectivities yet low current densities whereas conventional nanoparticle catalysts exhibit relatively high current densities but low selectivities. This work combines the advantages of the two classes of catalysts by constructing a Ni&#8208;Gd&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon black electrocatalyst within which NiI active sites are exposed outside the carbon layers and Ni nanoparticles are encapsulated inside the carbon layers. The Gd atoms can not only influence the local electron densities of Ni 3d orbitals, thus strengthening the electronic activity, but also tailor the sizes of the Ni nanoparticles, thereby minimizing the activity toward hydrogen evolution. Accordingly, this electrocatalyst yields both a high CO faradaic efficiency (97&#8201;%) and a large current density (308&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), alongside an outstanding stability (100&#8197;h).

         <dc:description>C(sp  3  )&#8210;H &#160;bond coupling with carbon electrophiles remains rarely explored under thermo&#8208;driven hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) conditions due to a challenge of integrating oxidation and reduction in a single operation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbones are divalent carbon (0) species that contain two lone pairs of electrons. Herein, we have prepared the first known stable and isolable free  bis  &#8208;(carbone) pincer framework with a well&#8208;defined solid&#8208;state structure. This  bis  &#8208;(carbone) ligand is an effective scaffold for forming monometallic (Ni and Pd) and trinuclear heterometallic complexes with Au&#8211;Pd&#8211;Au, Au&#8211;Ni&#8211;Au, and Cu&#8211;Ni&#8211;Cu configurations. Sophisticated quantum&#8208;theoretical analyses found that the metal&#8208;metal interactions are too weak to play a significant role in upholding these multi&#8208;metallic configurations; rather, the four lone pairs of electrons within the  bis  &#8208;(carbone) framework are the main contributors to the stability of the complexes.</dc:description>
