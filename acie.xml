         <title>Nickel&#8208;promoted Electrocatalytic Graphitization of Biochars for Energy Storage: Mechanistic Understanding using Multi&#8208;scale Approaches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to high&#8208;efficiency and scalable advantages of electrolysis in molten salts, electrochemical conversion of carbonaceous resources into graphitic products is a sustainable route for achieving high value&#8208;added carbon. To understand the complicated kinetics of converting amorphous carbon (e.g. carbonized lignin&#8208;biochar) into highly graphitic carbon, herein this study reports the key processing parameters (addition of Ni, temperature and time) and multi&#8208;scale approach of nickel&#8208;boosted electrochemical graphitization&#8208;catalysis processes in molten calcium chloride. Upon both experiments and modellings, multi&#8208;scale analysis that ranges from nanoscale atomic reaction to macroscale cell reveal the multi&#8208;field evolution in the electrolysis cell, mechanism of electrochemical reaction kinetics as well as pathway of nickel&#8208;boosted graphitization and tubulization. The results of as&#8208;achieved controllable processing regions and multi&#8208;scale approaches provide a rational strategy of manipulating electrochemical graphitization processes and utilizing the converted biomass resources for high value&#8208;added use.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambient Preparation of Benzoxazine&#8208;based Phenolic Resins Enables Long&#8208;term Sustainable Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of polymer structures at the molecular level promotes the iteration of high&#8208;performance photocatalyst for sustainable photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production from oxygen and water, which also lays the basis for revealing the reaction mechanism. Here we report a benzoxazine&#8208;based m&#8208;aminophenol&#8208;formaldehyde resin (APFac) polymerized at ambient conditions, exhibiting superior H2O2 yield and long&#8208;term stability to most polymeric photocatalysts. Benzoxazine structure was identified as the crucial photocatalytic active segment in APFac. Favorable adsorption of oxygen/intermediates on benzoxazine structure and commendable product selectivity accelerated the reaction kinetically in stepwise single&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. The proposed benzoxazine&#8208;based phenolic resin provides the possibility of production in batches and industrial application, and sheds light on the de novo design and analysis of metal&#8208;free polymeric photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Production of CO from Organic Pollutants by Coupling Piezocatalysis and Advanced Oxidation Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To date, the chemical conversion of organic pollutants into value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks rather than CO2 remains a major challenge. Herein, we successfully develop a piezocatalysis coupling advanced oxidation process (AOP) system for achieving the conversion of various organic pollutants to CO. The CO product stems from the specific process in which organics are first oxidized to carbonate through peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based AOPs, and then the as&#8208;obtained carbonate is converted into CO by piezoelectric reduction under ultrasonic (US) vibration by using a Co3S4/MoS2 catalyst. Experiments and DFT calculations show that the introduction of Co3S4 can not only effectively promote the transfer and utilization of piezoelectric electrons but also realize the highly selective conversion from carbonate to CO. The Co3S4/MoS2/PMS system has achieved the selective generation of CO in the actual complex wastewater treatment for the first time, indicating its potential practical application prospect.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Electroluminescence from Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Perovskite Quantum Cutters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) deliver size and composition&#8208;tunable luminescence of high efficiency and color purity in the visible. However, attaining efficient electroluminescence (EL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region from PeNCs is challenging, limiting their potential applications. Here we demonstrate a highly efficient NIR light emitting diode (LED) by doping ytterbium ions into the PeNCs host (Yb3+:PeNCs), extending the EL wavelengths toward 1000 nm, which is achieved through a direct sensitization of Yb3+ ions by the PeNC host. Efficient quantum cutting processes enable high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 126% from the Yb3+:PeNCs. Through halide&#8208;composition engineering and surface passivation strategy to improve both PLQY and charge transport balance, we demonstrate an efficient NIR LED with a peak EQE of 7.7% at a central wavelength of 990 nm, representing the most efficient perovskite&#8208;based LEDs with emission wavelengths beyond 850 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Cooperativity and Hydrogen Bonding Allow&#160;Efficient Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reduction of CO2 selectively to one of the several C1 based product presents a challenge as the thermodynamic reduction potentials of the different ne&#8208;/nH+ reduction of CO2 are similar and so is the reduction potential for H+ reduction. Halime, Aukauloo and co&#8208;workers have utilized the design principles of the active site of Nickle CO dehydrogenase (Ni CODH) to design bimetallic iron porphyrins bridged by urea moiety. These complexes show faster and selective reduction of CO2 to CO and their results are suggestive of a Ni CODH type mechanism at play where one of the two metal binds and reduces the CO2 while the other stabilize the reduced species by forming a bridged complex&#160;and facilitates C&#8208;O bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Starch&#8208;Based Superabsorbent Hydrogel with High Electrolyte Retention Capability and Synergistic Interface Engineering for Long&#8208;Lifespan Flexible Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;advent of wearable electronics has strongly stimulated advanced research into the exploration of flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs)&#160;with high theoretical energy density, high inherent safety, and low cost. However, the half&#8208;open battery structure and the high concentration of alkaline aqueous environment pose great challenges on the electrolyte retention capability and the zinc anode stability. Herein,&#160;a starch&#8208;based superabsorbent hydrogel polymer electrolyte (SSHPE)&#160;with high ionic conductivity, electrolyte absorption and retention capabilities, strong alkaline resistance and high zinc anode stability has been designed and applied in ZABs. Experimental and calculational analyses probe into the root of the superiority of SSHPEs, confirming the significance of the carboxyl functional groups along their polymer chains. These features endow the as&#8208;fabricated ZAB a long cycle life of 300 h, much longer than that with commonly used poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Caging of Carboxyl Groups for On&#8208;Demand Protein Activation with Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tools for on&#8208;demand protein activation enable impactful gain&#8208;of&#8208;function studies in biological settings. Thus far, however, proteins have been chemically caged at primarily Lys, Tyr, and Sec, typically through the genetic encoding of unnatural amino acids. Here, we report that the preferential reactivity of diazo compounds with protonated&#160;acids&#160;can be used to expand this toolbox to solvent&#8208;accessible carboxyl groups with an elevated pKa. As a model protein, we employed lysozyme (Lyz), which has an active&#8208;site Glu35 with a pKa&#160;of 6.2. A diazo compound with a bioorthogonal self&#8208;immolative handle esterified Glu35 selectively, inactivating Lyz. The hydrolytic activity of the caged Lyz on bacterial cell walls was restored with two small&#8208;molecule triggers. The decaging was more efficient by small molecules than by esterases. This simple chemical strategy was also applied to a hemeprotein and an aspartyl protease, setting the stage for broad applicability.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tools for on-demand protein activation enable impactful gain-of-function studies in biological settings. Thus far, however, proteins have been chemically caged at primarily Lys, Tyr, and Sec, typically through the genetic encoding of unnatural amino acids. Here, we report that the preferential reactivity of diazo compounds with protonated&#160;acids&#160;can be used to expand this toolbox to solvent-accessible carboxyl groups with an elevated pKa. As a model protein, we employed lysozyme (Lyz), which has an active-site Glu35 with a pKa&#160;of 6.2. A diazo compound with a bioorthogonal self-immolative handle esterified Glu35 selectively, inactivating Lyz. The hydrolytic activity of the caged Lyz on bacterial cell walls was restored with two small-molecule triggers. The decaging was more efficient by small molecules than by esterases. This simple chemical strategy was also applied to a hemeprotein and an aspartyl protease, setting the stage for broad applicability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A BN&#8208;Doped U&#8208;Shaped Heteroacene as a Molecular Floating Gate for Ambipolar Charge Trapping Memory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two wide&#8208;bandgap U&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with/without boron and nitrogen (BN&#8208;) doping (BN&#8208;1 and C&#8208;1) were synthesized to tune the electronic features to suit the performance requirements in organic field&#8208;effect transistor memory (OFET&#8208;NVM). The chemical structures were characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy and single crystal diffraction. Owing to the electron donor effect of N and the high electron affinity of B, the BN&#8208;1&#8208;based OFET&#8208;NVM displays large ambipolar memory windows and an enhanced charge storage density compared to C&#8208;1 and most of the reported small molecules. A novel supramolecular system formed via BN&#8208;1 and PMMA contributes to fabricating uniform films with homogeneous microstructures, which serve as a two&#8208;in&#8208;one tunnelling dielectric and charge trapping layer to realize long&#8208;term charge retention and reliable endurance. Our results demonstrate that both BN doping and supramolecular engineering are crucial for the charge trapping of OFET&#8208;NVM</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the key challenges of improving clinical outcomes of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) is overcoming cancer resistance to the antibody and/or drug components of ADCs, and hence the need for ADC platforms with high combinatory flexibility. Here, we introduce the use of self&#8208;assembled&#160;left&#8208;handed DNA (L&#8208;DNA) oligonucleotides to link combinatory single&#8208;domain antibodies and toxin payloads for tunable and adaptive delivery of ADCs. We demonstrate that the method allows convenient construction of a library of ADCs with multi&#8208;specific targeting, multi&#8208;specific payloads, and exact drug&#8208;antibody ratio. The newly constructed ADCs with L&#8208;DNA scaffold showed favorable properties of in vitro cell cytotoxicity and in vivo suppression and eradication of solid tumors. Collectively, our data suggest that the L&#8208;DNA based modular ADC (MADC) platform is a viable option for generating therapeutic ADCs and for potentially expanding ADC therapeutic window via multi&#8208;specificity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP)&#8208;Based Straight&#8208;Shaped Diphosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[1.1.1]Propellane, which is structurally simple and compact, exhibits promising potential for the synthesis of disubstituted straight&#8208;shaped bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) compounds by manipulation of its highly reactive internal C&#8211;C bond. BCPs are considered to be isosteres of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted benzenes, which have found broad applications in the areas of functional molecules and drug discovery. The internal C&#8211;C single bond of [1.1.1]propellane is regarded as a charge&#8208;shift bond, which can be readily cleaved by radical means to construct BCPs. We herein report a novel synthetic method for (un)symmetric diphosphines based on the BCP motif, which can be interpreted as isosteres of 1,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)benzenes. The obtained BCP&#8208;diphosphine derivatives were used to generate a straight&#8208;shaped Au complex and an Eu&#8208;based coordination polymer.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Experience in both catalyst and reaction design is required to solve remaining limitations and to set new standards &#8230; In contrast to previous studies, we aimed at the design of new catalysts based on data rather than on chemical intuition.&#8221; Find out more about the collaborative work in the Gessner and Goo&#223;en groups on accelerating catalyst and reaction development.







Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Gessner and Goo&#223;en research groups at Ruhr&#8208;University Bochum (Germany). They recently published a series of articles in Angewandte Chemie on the application of ylide&#8208;substituted phosphines (YPhos) in palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions. Owing to their inherently strong sigma&#8208;donating ability and their modular synthesis, YPhos ligands can be tailored to fit the demands of various catalytic transformations. In the most recent article, machine learning methods were applied to identify a YPhos catalyst that enables the previously elusive Hiyama coupling of aryl chlorides. &#8220;Computer&#8208;Driven Development of Ylide Functionalized Phosphines for Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hiyama Couplings&#8221;, J.&#8197;F.

         <title>Reduction of Platinum(IV) Prodrug Hemoglobin Nanoparticles with Deeply&#8208;Penetrating Ultrasound Radiation for Tumor&#8208;Targeted Therapeutically Enhanced Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of PtIV prodrugs that are reduced into the therapeutically active PtII species within the tumor microenvironment has received much research interest. In order to provide spatial and temporal control over the treatment, there is a high demand for the development of compounds that could be selectively activated upon irradiation. Despite recent progress, the majority of PtIV complexes are excited with ultraviolet or blue light, limiting the use of such compounds for superficial application. To overcome this limitation, herein, the first example of PtIV prodrug nanoparticles that could be reduced with deeply penetrating ultrasound radiation is reported, enabling the treatment of deep&#8208;seated or large tumors. The nanoparticles were found to selectively accumulate inside a mouse colon carcinoma tumor upon intravenous injection as well as able to eradicate the tumor upon exposure to ultrasound radiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Epitope Organization with Self&#8208;adjuvant Framework Nucleic Acid for Efficient COVID&#8208;19 Peptide Vaccine Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide vaccines have advantages in easy fabrication and high safety, but their effectiveness is subjected to the poor immunogenicity of epitopes themselves. Herein, we constructed a series of framework nucleic acids (FNAs) with regulated rigidity and size as self&#8208;adjuvant carriers to precisely organize epitopes, in order to reveal the influence of epitope spacing and carrier rigidity on the efficiency of peptide vaccines. We found that assembling epitopes on rigid tetrahedral FNAs (tFNAs) with the appropriate size could efficiently enhance their immunogenicity. Further, by integrating epitopes from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 on preferred tFNAs, we constructed a COVID&#8208;19 peptide vaccine which could induce high titers of IgG against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, and increase the ratio of memory B and T cells in mice. Considering the good biocompatibility of tFNAs, our research provided a new idea for developing efficient peptide vaccines against viruses and possibly other diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Biomimetic Dimerization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomimetic oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives in aqueous media with oxygen as a bulk oxidant catalyzed by an iron octacarboxy phthalocyanine complex was established. The discovery of the extremely active iron catalyst enables to perform aerobic enzyme&#8208;mimetic oxidation in the flask. This method was applicable to the oxidative dimerization of a wide range of tryptophan derivatives, including various dipeptides and oligopeptides with remarkable functional group tolerance without the protection of the amino acid residues. Furthermore, oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives bearing dioxopiperazine units enabled the convergent total synthesis of five natural pyrroloindole compounds and unnatural congeners. The established chemical method will provide facile access to a broad range of dimerized peptides with the unique scaffold to link two turn structures, which would serve as a powerful tool to create new small&#8208; or middle&#8208;molecule drug candidates.</dc:description>

         <title>Circumcoronenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circumcoronenes were finally obtained by solution&#8208;phase synthesis and isolated in crystalline form. The Br&#248;nsted/Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ethers or alkynes was employed as the key reaction. X&#8208;ray analysis, NMR and theoretical calculations confirmed a structure with seven aromatic sextets and six localized K&#8208;region double bonds.







Abstract
Circumcoronene, a hexagonal graphene fragment with six zigzag edges, has been the focus of theoretical studies for many years, but its synthesis in solution has remained a challenge. In this study, we present a facile method for synthesizing three derivatives of circumcoronene using Br&#248;nsted/Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ether or alkyne. Their structures were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Bond length analysis, NMR measurement, and theoretical calculations showed that circumcoronene mostly follows Clar's bonding model and exhibits dominant local aromaticity. Its absorption and emission spectra are similar to those of the smaller hexagonal coronene due to its six&#8208;fold symmetry.

         <title>Superhydrophobic and Conductive Wire Membrane for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superhydrophobic, conductive and hierarchical wire (CuO/F/C(w)) membrane composed of porous core&#8211;shell CuO nanospheres, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) is fabricated by a facile electrospinning strategy. Advantageous features of this membrane electrode including maximized triple&#8208;phase interfaces on highly exposed CuO, good conductivity and hierarchical architecture enable adequate CO2 supply and effective electron/mass transfer, and afford numerous active sites for efficient CO2 electroreduction to multicarbon products.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid triple&#8208;phase interfaces (TPI) are essential for promoting electrochemical CO2 reduction, but it remains challenging to maximize their efficiency while integrating other desirable properties conducive to electrocatalysis. Herein, we report the elaborate design and fabrication of a superhydrophobic, conductive, and hierarchical wire membrane in which core&#8211;shell CuO nanospheres, carbon nanotubes (CNT), and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are integrated into a wire structure (designated as CuO/F/C(w); F, PTFE; C, CNT; w, wire) to maximize their respective functions. The realized architecture allows almost all CuO nanospheres to be exposed with effective TPI and good contact to conductive CNT, thus increasing the local CO2 concentration on the CuO surface and enabling fast electron/mass transfer. As a result, the CuO/F/C(w) membrane attains a Faradaic efficiency of 56.8&#8201;% and a partial current density of 68.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for multicarbon products at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) in the H&#8208;type cell, far exceeding 10.1&#8201;% and 13.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for bare CuO.

         <title>Ammonium Ion Batteries: Material, Electrochemistry and Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonium&#8208;ion batteries have shown great potential due to their unique advantages including their high safety and fast diffusion kinetics in low&#8208;cost energy storage systems. Compared with the common metal cations batteries AIBs offer great advantages of favorable sustainability and fast diffusion kinetics with hydrogen bond in different electrode materials.







Abstract
Ammonium&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) have recently attracted increasing attention in the field of aqueous batteries owing to their high safety and fast diffusion kinetics. The NH4+ storage mechanism is quite different from that of spherical metal ions (e.g. Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) because of the formation of hydrogen bonds between NH4+ and host materials. Although many materials have been proposed as electrode materials for AIBs, their performances hardly meet the requirement of future electrochemical energy storage devices. It is thus urgent to design and exploit advanced materials for AIBs. This review highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research on AIBs. The insights into the basic configuration, operating mechanism and recent progress of electrode materials and corresponding electrolytes for AIBs have been comprehensively outlined. The electrode materials are classified and compared according to different NH4+ storage behaviour in the structure. The challenges, design strategies and perspectives are also discussed for the future development of AIBs.

         <title>Stereoselective C&#8208;Aryl Glycosylation by Catalytic Cross&#8208;Coupling of Heteroaryl Glycosyl Sulfones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bench&#8208;stable heteroaryl glycosyl sulfones undergo desulfonylative C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling with aryl&#8208;substituted nucleophiles or electrophiles through two complementary catalytic systems. The reactions offer access to a wide variety of C&#8208;aryl glycoside products with high diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation reactions are increasingly gaining attention in carbohydrate chemistry because they enable glycosyl precursors, readily accessible as anomeric mixtures, to converge to a single diastereomeric product. However, controlling the stereochemical outcome through transition&#8208;metal catalysis remains challenging, and methods that leverage bench&#8208;stable heteroaryl glycosyl sulfone donors to facilitate glycosylation are rare. Herein, we show two complementary nonprecious metal catalytic systems, based on iron or nickel, which are capable of promoting efficient C&#8722;C coupling between heteroaryl glycosyl sulfones and aromatic nucleophiles or electrophiles through distinct mechanisms and modes of activation. Diverse C&#8208;aryl glycosides were secured with excellent selectivity, scope, and functional&#8208;group compatibility, and reliable access to both &#945; and &#946; isomers was possible for key sugar residues.

Herein, we show two complementary nonprecious metal catalytic systems, based on iron or nickel, which are capable of promoting efficient C&#8722;C coupling between heteroaryl glycosyl sulfones and aromatic nucleophiles or electrophiles through distinct mechanisms and modes of activation. Diverse &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-aryl glycosides were secured with excellent selectivity, scope, and functional-group compatibility, and reliable access to both &#945; and &#946; isomers was possible for key sugar residues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Multiform Hollow&#8208;Structured Covalent Organic Frameworks via a Facile and Universal Strategy for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and universal two&#8208;step strategy based on solvent evaporation and oxidation of imine bond was proposed for the fast synthesis of hollow covalent organic frameworks (HCOFs), achieving the construction of a HCOFs library with diverse nanostructures. The synthesized HCOFs with abundant cavities are ideal nanocarriers for high&#8208;efficiency drug loading, thus enhancing the sonodynamic cancer therapy.







Abstract
The special structural morphology of hollow covalent organic frameworks (HCOFs) has an important influence on their applications. However, the rapid and precise control of morphology for HCOFs still remains largely challenging. Herein, we present a facile and universal two&#8208;step strategy based on solvent evaporation and oxidation of imine bond for the controllable synthesis of HCOFs. The strategy enables to prepare HCOFs in a greatly shortened reaction time and seven kinds of HCOFs are fabricated by the oxidation of imine bond via hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) generated from Fenton reaction. Importantly, a fascinating library of HCOFs with diverse nanostructures, including bowl&#8208;like, yolk&#8208;shell, capsule&#8208;like and flower&#8208;like morphologies, has been ingeniously constructed. Owing to the large cavities, the obtained HCOFs are ideal candidates for drug delivery, which are employed to load five small molecule drugs, achieving the enhanced sonodynamic cancer therapy in vivo.

         <title>Janus Effect of Lewis Acid Enables One&#8208;Step Block Copolymerization of Ethylene Oxide and N&#8208;Sulfonyl Aziridine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step sequence&#8208;selective synthesis of AnBm&#8208;type block copolymers has been rarely reported. Here, ethylene oxide and N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridine compose a valid pair provided with a bicomponent metal&#8208;free catalyst owing to a Janus effects of Lewis acid on the activity of the two monomers.







Abstract
One&#8208;step sequence&#8208;selective block copolymerization requires stringent catalytic control of monomers relative activity and enchainment order. It has been especially rare for AnBm&#8208;type block copolymers from simple binary monomer mixtures. Here, ethylene oxide (EO) and N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridine (Az) compose a valid pair provided with a bicomponent metal&#8208;free catalyst. Optimal Lewis acid/base ratio allows the two monomers to strictly block&#8208;copolymerize in a reverse order (EO&#8208;first) as compared with the conventional anionic route (Az&#8208;first). Livingness of the copolymerization facilitates one&#8208;pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers by addition of mixed monomers in batches. Calculation results reveal that a Janus effect of Lewis acid on the two monomers is key to enlarge the activity difference and reverse the enchainment order.

         <title>Lattice Mismatch Guided Nickel&#8208;Indium Heterogeneous Alloy Electrocatalysts for Promoting the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice mismatch guides the selective alloying of tetragonal In to fcc Ni rather than hcp Ni. The heterogeneous alloy with 5&#8197;at% In catalyzes the electrochemical production of 153&#8197;mL&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2 at &#8722;385&#8197;mV with 9.15&#8197;H2&#8201;s&#8722;1 turnover frequency at 400&#8197;mV vs. RHE in 1&#8197;M KOH.







Abstract
The immiscibility of crystallographic facets in multi&#8208;metallic catalysts plays a key role in driving the green H2 production by water electrolysis. The lattice mismatch between tetragonal In and face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) Ni is 14.9&#8201;% but the mismatch with hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) Ni is 49.8&#8201;%. Hence, in a series of Ni&#8722;In heterogeneous alloys, In is selectively incorporated in the fcc Ni. The 18&#8211;20&#8197;nm Ni particles have 36&#8197;wt&#8201;% fcc phase, which increases to 86&#8201;% after In incorporation. The charge transfer from In to Ni, stabilizes the Ni0 state and In develops a fractional positive charge that favors *OH adsorption. With only 5&#8197;at% In, 153&#8197;mL&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2 is evolved at &#8722;385&#8197;mV with mass activity of 57.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at&#8212;400&#8197;mV, 200&#8197;h stability at &#8722;0.18&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and Pt&#8208;like activity at high current densities, due to the spontaneous water dissociation, lower activation energy barrier, optimal adsorption energy of OH&#8722; ions and the prevention of catalyst poisoning.

         <title>Synthesis of Bandgap&#8208;tunable Transition Metal Sulfides through Gas&#8208;phase Cation Exchange&#8208;induced Topological Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The occurrence of cation exchange with different crystal structures is limited. We propose a new descriptor, the parallel six&#8208;sided subunit (PSS), to synthesize transition metal sulfides with crystal structure selectivity by gas&#8208;phase cation exchange&#8208;induced topological transformation. Powered by precise synthetic control, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance is improved by 36.2 times after band gap engineering.







Abstract
Oriented synthesis of transition metal sulfides (TMSs) with controlled compositions and crystal structures has long been promising for electronic devices and energy applications. Liquid&#8208;phase cation exchange (LCE) is a well&#8208;studied route by varying the compositions. However, achieving crystal structure selectivity is still a great challenge. Here, we demonstrate gas&#8208;phase cation exchange (GCE), which can induce a specific topological transformation (TT), for the synthesis of versatile TMSs with identified cubic or hexagonal crystal structures. The parallel six&#8208;sided subunit (PSS), a new descriptor, is defined to describe the substitution of cations and the transition of the anion sublattice. Under this principle, the band gap of targeted TMSs can be tailored. Using the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution as an example, the optimal hydrogen evolution rate of a zinc&#8208;cadmium sulfide (ZCS4) is determined to be 11.59&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, showing a 36.2&#8208;fold improvement over CdS.

         <title>Covalent Template&#8208;Directed Synthesis of a Spoked 18&#8208;Porphyrin Nanoring
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed alkyne trimerization followed by oxidating coupling and fusion of zinc porphyrin units was used to construct a porphyrin nanoring around a central covalent spoke. The size and shape of these nanorings (diameter: 4.7&#8197;nm) was confirmed by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). A combination of zinc(II) and nickel(II) porphyrin units was used to increase the efficiency of the synthesis and control the positions of oxidative fusion.







Abstract
Rings of porphyrins mimic natural light&#8208;harvesting chlorophyll arrays and offer insights into electronic delocalization, providing a motivation for creating larger nanorings with closely spaced porphyrin units. Here, we demonstrate the first synthesis of a macrocycle consisting entirely of 5,15&#8208;linked porphyrins.

     alt="Covalent Template-Directed Synthesis of a Spoked 18-Porphyrin Nanoring**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalt-catalyzed alkyne trimerization followed by oxidating coupling and fusion of zinc porphyrin units was used to construct a porphyrin nanoring around a central covalent spoke. The size and shape of these nanorings (diameter: 4.7&#8197;nm) was confirmed by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). A combination of zinc(II) and nickel(II) porphyrin units was used to increase the efficiency of the synthesis and control the positions of oxidative fusion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rings of porphyrins mimic natural light-harvesting chlorophyll arrays and offer insights into electronic delocalization, providing a motivation for creating larger nanorings with closely spaced porphyrin units. Here, we demonstrate the first synthesis of a macrocycle consisting entirely of 5,15-linked porphyrins. This porphyrin octadecamer was constructed using a covalent six-armed template, made by cobalt-catalyzed cyclotrimerization of an H-shaped tolan with porphyrin trimer ends. The porphyrins around the circumference of the nanoring were linked together by intramolecular oxidative &lt;i&gt;meso-meso&lt;/i&gt; coupling and partial &#946;-&#946; fusion, to give a nanoring consisting of six edge-fused zinc(II) porphyrin dimer units and six un-fused nickel(II) porphyrins. STM imaging on a gold surface confirms the size and shape of the spoked 18-porphyrin nanoring (calculated diameter: 4.7&#8197;nm).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Stabilized Defective Black Phosphorene as a Lithium&#8208;Like Catalyst for Boosting Nitrogen Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and feasible strategy is proposed for obtaining environmentally stable defective black phosphorene via simultaneously constructing defects and fluorination protection. Due to the inherent high chemical reactivity, the fluorine&#8208;stabilized defective black phosphorene as a nitrogen reduction electrocatalyst induces a high NH3 yield rate of &#8776;70&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and a high Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;26&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) is recognized as a zero&#8208;carbon emission method for NH3 synthesis. However, to date, this technology still suffers from low yield and low selectivity associated with the catalyst. Herein, inspired by the activation of N2 by lithium metal, a highly reactive defective black phosphorene (D&#8722;BPene) is proposed as a lithium&#8208;like catalyst for boosting electrochemical N2 activation. Correspondingly, we also report a strategy for producing environmentally stable D&#8722;BPene by simultaneously constructing defects and fluorination protection based on topochemical reactions. Reliable performance evaluations show that the fluorine&#8208;stabilized D&#8722;BPene can induce a high NH3 yield rate of &#8776;70&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and a high Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;26&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE in an aqueous electrolyte. This work not only exemplifies the first stable preparation and practical application of D&#8722;BPene, but also brings a new design idea for NRR catalysts.

         <title>Amplification of Dissymmetry for Circularly Polarized Photodetection by Cooperative Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available point chirality units have been embedded adjacent to dicyanostilbene moieties in monomers to effect cooperative supramolecular polymerization. This effective and economic approach based on the synergistic participation of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, which facilitate remote chirality transfer to the &#960;&#8208;conjugated core, allows photodetection based on circularly polarized light.







Abstract
Circularly polarized photodetectors require chiral light absorption materials with high sensing efficiency and low costs. Here readily accessible point chirality has been introduced to dicyanostilbenes as the chiral source, facilitating remote chirality transfer to the &#960;&#8208;aromatic core by cooperative supramolecular polymerization. The single&#8208;handed supramolecular polymers display powerful circularly polarized photodetection capability with a dissymmetry factor value as high as 0.83, superior to those of &#960;&#8208;conjugated small molecules and oligomers. Strong chiral amplification occurs between the enantiopure sergeants and the achiral soldiers. The resulting supramolecular copolymers exhibit comparable photodetection efficiency to those of the homopolymeric ones, with a 90&#8201;% decrease in the enantiopure compound consumption. Therefore, cooperative supramolecular polymerization provides an effective yet economical avenue toward circularly polarized photodetection applications.

         <title>Post&#8208;Nickelation of a Crystalline Trinuclear Copper Organic Framework for Synergistic Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterometallic framework was fabricated by post&#8208;modification of the copper&#8208;containing organic framework USTB&#8208;11(Cu) with divalent nickel ions. Synergistic effects between trinuclear copper clusters and nickel ions resulted in photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CO with a high conversion rate and selectivity.







Abstract
Rational regulation of electronic structures and functionalities of framework materials still remains challenging. Herein, reaction of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilo&#8208;tribenzhydrazide with tris(&#956;2&#8208;4&#8208;carboxaldehyde&#8208;pyrazolato&#8208;N,N&#8242;)&#8208;tricopper (Cu3Py3) generates the crystalline copper organic framework USTB&#8208;11(Cu). Post&#8208;modification with divalent nickel ions affords the heterometallic framework USTB&#8208;11(Cu,Ni). Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical simulations reveal their two&#8208;dimensional hexagonal structure geometry. A series of advanced spectroscopic techniques disclose the mixed CuI/CuII state nature of Cu3Py3 in USTB&#8208;11(Cu,Ni) with a uniform bistable Cu34+(CuI2CuII)&#8201;:&#8201;Cu35+(CuICuII2) (ca. 1&#8201;:&#8201;3) oxidation state, resulting in a significantly improved formation efficiency of the charge&#8208;separation state. This endows the Ni sites with enhanced activity and USTB&#8208;11(Cu,Ni) with outstanding photocatalytic CO2 to CO performance with a conversion rate of 22&#8201;130&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and selectivity of 98&#8201;%.

         <title>Sulfonyl&#8208;PYBOX Ligands Enable Kinetic Resolution of &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Azides by CuAAC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first highly selective kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;chiral azides by Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions (CuAAC), providing facile access to chiral &#945;&#8208;tertiary azides and 1,2,3&#8208;trazoles with newly developed PYBOX ligands with a C4 sulfonyl group. The key role of the C4 sulfonyl in tuning the electronic and steric properties of the chiral catalysts to enhance enantiomer discrimination is rationalized by DFT calculations.







Abstract
We report the first highly selective kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;chiral azides via Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Newly developed pyridine&#8208;bisoxazoline (PYBOX) ligands, bearing a C4 sulfonyl group, enable effective kinetic resolution of racemic azides derived from privileged scaffolds such as indanone, cyclopentenone, and oxindole, and their asymmetric CuAAC to afford &#945;&#8208;tertiary 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles with high to excellent ee values. DFT calculations and control experiments reveal that the C4 sulfonyl group decreases the Lewis basicity of the ligand and increases the electrophilicity of the copper center for better recognition of azides, and functions as a shielding group to make the chiral pocket of the catalyst more effective.

         <title>Red Emissive Double Aza[7]helicenes with Antiaromaticity / Aromaticity Switching via the Redox&#8208;Induced Radical Cation and Dication Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyridazine core structure with antiaromatic character has been utilized to synthesize a double aza[7]helicene with rarely accessible chiroptical properties in the red region as well as redox&#8208;active behaviour. This chiral polyaromatic hydrocarbon system shows oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;dependent aromaticity/antiaromaticity switching via oxidation&#8208;induced cation species.







Abstract
We herein present the synthetic approach to a new antiaromatic double aza[7]helicene C that features NN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This heteroatom&#8208;doped helicene showed a rarely obtained long&#8208;wavelength emission and far&#8208;red circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the solid state. These optical and chiroptical properties could be ascribed to both the NN&#8208;PAH core structure and the further extension through angular ring fusions. Such a unique electronic structure also culminated in facile chemical oxidations of neutral C to the positively charged chiral radical (C&#8901;+) and dication species (C2+). Interestingly, DFT computations revealed that the pyridazine central core showed an antiaromaticity&#8208;to&#8208;aromaticity switching, in contrast to the inversed transition for the helical periphery in cationic states. The reported approaches are anticipated to lead to the development of further redox&#8208;active chiral systems for potential applications in chiroptoelectronics, spintronics as well as fluorescent bioimaging.

         <title>Heterobimetallic NiFe Cooperative Molecular Water Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of structurally well&#8208;defined bimetallic complexes (FeFe, NiFe, NiNi, ZnFe, NiZn) was used as a molecular platform to understand Ni/Fe cooperative water oxidation mechanism. The results disclosed that O&#8722;O bond formed via intramolecular oxyl&#8208;oxo coupling between bridged O radical and terminal FeIV=O moiety in NiIII(&#956;&#8208;O)FeIV=O species, which provides a helpful guidance for rational design of heterobimetallic catalysts.







Abstract
We reported herein the development of heterobimetallic NiFe molecular platform to understand NiFe synergistic effect in water oxidation catalysis. Compared to homonuclear bimetallic compounds (NiNi and FeFe), NiFe complex possesses more remarkable catalytic water oxidation performance. Mechanistic studies suggest that this remarkable difference is attributed to the fact that NiFe synergy can effectively promote O&#8722;O bond formation. The generated NiIII(&#956;&#8208;O)FeIV=O is the key intermediate and O&#8722;O bond was formed via intramolecular oxyl&#8208;oxo coupling between bridged O radical and terminal FeIV=O moiety.

         <title>Uniform Growth of Nanocrystalline ZIF&#8208;8&#8201;on Cellulose Nanocrystals: Useful Template for Microporous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) formed a ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle structure by sequential synthesis of a metal organic framework (MOF) on the surface of CNCs then a microporous organic polymer (MOP) on the surface of ZIF@CNC composites. The CNC materials functionalized with MOPs and ZIF&#8208;8 showed excellent catalytic performance in CO2 fixation.







Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) nanocrystals were uniformly grown on the surface of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) to give a hybrid material, ZIF@CNCs. By varying the stoichiometry of the components, it was possible to control the size of the ZIF&#8208;8 crystals grown on the CNC surface. Optimized ZIF@CNC (ZIF@CNC&#8208;2) was used as a template to synthesize a microporous organic polymer (MOP), ZIF@MOP@CNC. After etching the ZIF&#8208;8 with 6&#8197;M HCl solution, a MOP material with encapsulated CNCs (MOP@CNC) was formed. Zinc coordination into the porphyrin unit of the MOP yielded the ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle structure, Zn MOP@CNC, comprised of CNCs encapsulated within the Zn&#8208;MOP. In comparison to ZIF@CNC&#8208;2, Zn MOP@CNC showed better catalytic activity and chemical stability for CO2 fixation, converting epichlorohydrin to chloroethylene carbonate. This work demonstrates a novel approach to create porous materials through CNC templating.

         <title>Inverse CO2/C2H2 Separation with MFU&#8208;4&#8201;and Selectivity Reversal via Postsynthetic Ligand Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MFU&#8208;4 shows high selectivity for adsorption of CO2 over C2H2 owing to a large activation energy for C2H2 diffusion through narrow pore apertures. Postsynthetic F&#8722;/Cl&#8722; ligand exchange increases the pore aperture size, allowing MFU&#8208;4&#8208;F to adsorb a large quantity of C2H2 and exhibit reversed selectivity for C2H2/CO2 separation.







Abstract
Although many porous materials, including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), have been reported to selectively adsorb C2H2 in C2H2/CO2 separation processes, CO2&#8208;selective sorbents are much less common. Here, we report the remarkable performance of MFU&#8208;4 (Zn5Cl4(bbta)3, bbta=benzo&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;bistriazolate) toward inverse CO2/C2H2 separation. The MOF facilitates kinetic separation of CO2 from C2H2, enabling the generation of high purity C2H2 (&gt;98&#8201;%) with good productivity in dynamic breakthrough experiments. Adsorption kinetics measurements and computational studies show C2H2 is excluded from MFU&#8208;4 by narrow pore windows formed by Zn&#8722;Cl groups. Postsynthetic F&#8722;/Cl&#8722; ligand exchange was used to synthesize an analogue (MFU&#8208;4&#8208;F) with expanded pore apertures, resulting in equilibrium C2H2/CO2 separation with reversed selectivity compared to MFU&#8208;4. MFU&#8208;4&#8208;F also exhibits a remarkably high C2H2 adsorption capacity (6.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1), allowing fuel grade C2H2 (98&#8201;% purity) to be harvested from C2H2/CO2 mixtures by room temperature desorption.

         <title>Reversible Zn Metal Anodes Enabled by Trace Amounts of Underpotential Deposition Initiators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
M is a metal with a higher reduction potential and work function than Zn. Using Mn+ as an electrolyte additive, the Mn+ would deposit preferentially and then render UPD of Zn uniformly on M. Moreover, the deposited M can dissolve back into the electrolyte after Zn stripping and thus does not increase the interfacial charge transfer resistance, enabling a highly reversible Zn anode. Ni2+, Cr2+, and Co2+ have been verified to function as Mn+.







Abstract
Routine electrolyte additives are not effective enough for uniform zinc (Zn) deposition, because they are hard to proactively guide atomic&#8208;level Zn deposition. Here, based on underpotential deposition (UPD), we propose an &#8220;escort effect&#8221; of electrolyte additives for uniform Zn deposition at the atomic level. With nickel ion (Ni2+) additives, we found that metallic Ni deposits preferentially and triggers the UPD of Zn on Ni. This facilitates firm nucleation and uniform growth of Zn while suppressing side reactions. Besides, Ni dissolves back into the electrolyte after Zn stripping with no influence on interfacial charge transfer resistance. Consequently, the optimized cell operates for over 900&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (more than 4 times longer than the blank one). Moreover, the universality of &#8220;escort effect&#8221; is identified by using Cr3+ and Co2+ additives. This work would inspire a wide range of atomic&#8208;level principles by controlling interfacial electrochemistry for various metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;M is a metal with a higher reduction potential and work function than Zn. Using M&lt;sup&gt;n+&lt;/sup&gt; as an electrolyte additive, the M&lt;sup&gt;n+&lt;/sup&gt; would deposit preferentially and then render UPD of Zn uniformly on M. Moreover, the deposited M can dissolve back into the electrolyte after Zn stripping and thus does not increase the interfacial charge transfer resistance, enabling a highly reversible Zn anode. Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; have been verified to function as M&lt;sup&gt;n+&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Routine electrolyte additives are not effective enough for uniform zinc (Zn) deposition, because they are hard to proactively guide atomic-level Zn deposition. Here, based on underpotential deposition (UPD), we propose an &#8220;escort effect&#8221; of electrolyte additives for uniform Zn deposition at the atomic level. With nickel ion (Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) additives, we found that metallic Ni deposits preferentially and triggers the UPD of Zn on Ni. This facilitates firm nucleation and uniform growth of Zn while suppressing side reactions. Besides, Ni dissolves back into the electrolyte after Zn stripping with no influence on interfacial charge transfer resistance. Consequently, the optimized cell operates for over 900&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (more than 4 times longer than the blank one). Moreover, the universality of &#8220;escort effect&#8221; is identified by using Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; additives. This work would inspire a wide range of atomic-level principles by controlling interfacial electrochemistry for various metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Outer&#8208;Shell Self&#8208;Supported Nickel Catalysts for the Synthesis of Polyolefin Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and general heterogenization route was employed to prepare outer&#8208;shell self&#8208;supported &#945;&#8208;diimine Ni catalysts. These heterogeneous catalysts demonstrate high activity, stable catalytic performances towards different fillers, and good morphology control in the synthesis of polyolefin composites with great mechanical and customized properties.







Abstract
In situ heterogeneous olefin polymerization has attracted much attention for the synthesis of polyolefin composites. However, the complicated syntheses of specially designed catalysts or the detrimental effects of interactions between catalyst and solid supports pose great challenges. In this contribution, an outer&#8208;shell self&#8208;supporting strategy was designed to heterogenize nickel catalysts on different fillers via precipitation homopolymerization of ionic cluster type polar monomer. These catalysts demonstrated high activity, good product morphology control, and stable performances in ethylene polymerization and copolymerization. Moreover, various polyolefin composites with great mechanical and customized properties can be efficiently synthesized.

         <title>Somalactams A&#8211;D: Anti&#8208;inflammatory Macrolide Lactams with Unique Ring Systems from an Arctic Actinomycete Strain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new macrolide lactams, which were biosynthesized by a novel gene cluster sml, were isolated from an Arctic actinomycete strain. Multiple structural elucidation approaches were integrated to determine their structures. One of the compounds was found to inhibit IL&#8208;6 and TNF&#8208;&#945; release in the serum of LPS&#8208;stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It inhibited the MAPK pathway and significantly protected zebrafish from LPS&#8208;induced inflammation.







Abstract
Four new PKS&#8208;NRPS&#8208;derived macrolide lactams with three unique ring fusion types were discovered from the Arctic sponge associated actinomycete Streptomyces somaliensis 1107 using a genome mining strategy. Their structures were elucidated by a combination of MS, NMR spectroscopic analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Biosynthetically, a novel gene cluster sml consisting of three polyketide synthases and one hybrid polyketide synthase&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase together with cytochrome P450s and flavin&#8208;containing monooxygenases and oxidoreductases was demonstrated to assemble the unique skeleton. Pharmacological studies revealed that compound 1 displayed a potent anti&#8208;inflammatory effect without cytotoxicity. It inhibited IL&#8208;6 and TNF&#8208;&#945; release in the serum of LPS&#8208;stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells with IC50 values of 5.76 and 0.18&#8197;&#956;M, respectively, and modulated the MAPK pathway. Moreover, compound 1 alleviated LPS&#8208;induced systemic inflammation in our transgenic fluorescent zebrafish model.

         <title>Discovering the Intrinsic Causes of Dendrite Formation in Zinc Metal Anodes: Lattice Defects and Residual Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Residual stress and lattice defects in commercial zinc anodes are essential factors for dendrite formation during zinc deposition as they lead to a heterogeneous deposition and limit the epitaxial growth of zinc. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.20218612), Haiyan Wang et&#8197;al. propose an annealing strategy for lattice defect repair and residual stress relief. As a result, a reconstructed zinc anode achieved a highly epitaxial growth.

         <title>Pretrichodermamide A Biosynthesis Reveals the Hidden Diversity of Epidithiodiketopiperazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic route of fungal epidithiodiketopiperazines (ETPs) was revealed by elucidating the biosynthesis of pretrichodermamide A. Diverse ETP derivatives, including 25 novel compounds, were characterized from tda gene deletion mutants, indicating divergent metabolic pathways of ETP intermediates and enzyme catalytic promiscuity.







Abstract
Fungal epidithiodiketopiperazines (ETPs) possess large structural diversity and complexity due to modifications of the cyclodipeptide skeleton. Elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of pretrichodermamide A (1) in Trichoderma hypoxylon revealed a flexible catalytic machinery of multiple enzymes for generating ETP diversity. Seven tailoring enzymes encoded by the tda cluster are involved in 1 biosynthesis, that is, four P450s TdaB and TdaQ for 1,2&#8208;oxazine formation, TdaI for C7&#8242;&#8208;hydroxylation, and TdaG for C4, C5&#8208;epoxidation, two methyltransferases TdaH for C6&#8242;&#8208; and TdaO for C7&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methylation, and a reductase TdaD for furan opening. Gene deletions led to the identification of 25 novel ETPs, including 20 shunt products, indicating the catalytic promiscuity of Tda enzymes. Particularly, TdaG and TdaD accept various substrates and catalyze regiospecific reactions at different stages of 1 biosynthesis. Our study not only uncovers a hidden library of ETP alkaloids, but also helps to understand the hidden chemical diversity of natural products by pathway manipulation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;temperature (400&#8201;&#176;C) conversion of Pd nanoclusters to Pd single atoms with the assistance of Cl ligands is illustrated by Tao Ding, Xiaokang Liu, Manzhou Zhu, Tao Yao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202218630). The Pd nanoclusters collapse when coordinated by Cl ligands, thus enabling the transformation to take place at low temperatures. The research sheds light on the rational design of atomically dispersed metal catalysts.

A new molecular design strategy has been proposed to construct the deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF molecules by the integration of asymmetric O&#8722;B&#8722;N and symmetric N&#8722;B&#8722;N MR units to form a rigid and extended &#960;&#8208;skeleton. The resultant ODBN exhibited deep&#8208;blue emission, high PLQY of 93&#8201;% and small FWHM of 26&#8197;nm. High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue OLED employing ODBN as emitter was achieved with maximum EQE value of 24.15&#8201;% and the CIE y coordinate below 0.1.







Abstract
Developing deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with both high efficiency and color purity remains a formidable challenge. Here, we proposed a design strategy by integrating asymmetric oxygen&#8208;boron&#8208;nitrogen (O&#8722;B&#8722;N) multi&#8208;resonance (MR) unit into traditional N&#8722;B&#8722;N MR molecules to form a rigid and extended O&#8722;B&#8722;N&#8722;B&#8722;N MR &#960;&#8208;skeleton. Three deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters of OBN, NBN and ODBN featuring asymmetric O&#8722;B&#8722;N, symmetric N&#8722;B&#8722;N and extended O&#8722;B&#8722;N&#8722;B&#8722;N MR units were synthesized through the regioselective one&#8208;shot electrophilic C&#8722;H borylation at different positions of the same precursor. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitter ODBN exhibited respectable deep&#8208;blue emission with Commission International de l&#8242;Eclairage coordinate of (0.16, 0.03), high photoluminescence quantum yield of 93&#8201;% and narrow full width at half maximum of 26&#8197;nm in toluene. Impressively, the simple trilayer OLED employing ODBN as emitter achieved a high external quantum efficiency up to 24.15&#8201;% accompanied by a deep blue emission with the corresponding CIE y coordinate below 0.1.

         <title>Asymmetric Construction of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Disubstituted Piperazinones Enabled by Benzilic Amide Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of enantioselective benzilic amide rearrangement for the synthesis of chiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted piperazinones have been developed. The reaction proceeds via a high ordered sequence of imidazolidination/formal 1,2&#8208;aza shift/1,2&#8208;aryl or alkyl migration. The observed enantioselectivity was proposed to be controlled by dynamic kinetic resolution in the 1,2&#8208;aryl/alkyl migration step.







Abstract
An unprecedent asymmetric catalytic benzilic amide rearrangement for the synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted piperazinones is reported. The reaction proceeds via a domino [4+1] imidazolidination/formal 1,2&#8208;nitrogen shift/1,2&#8208;aryl or alkyl migration sequence, employing readily available vicinal tricarbonyl compounds and 1,2&#8208;diamines as starting materials. This approach provides an efficient access to chiral C3&#8208;disubsituted piperazin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with high enantiocontrol, which are exceedingly difficult to access from the existing synthetic methodologies. The observed enantioselectivity was proposed to be controlled by dynamic kinetic resolution in the 1,2&#8208;aryl/alkyl migration step. The resulting densely functionalized products are versatile building blocks to bioactive natural products, drug molecules and their analogues.

         <title>Engineering Graphdiyne for Solar Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Because of their large specific surface area, adjustable band gap, and uniformly pore structure, graphdiyne (GDY) materials have become a rising star for photocatalytic energy conversion. This Minireview summarizes the unique physicochemical properties of GDY as well as the construction and progress of GDY&#8208;based photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction and nitrogen reduction.







Abstract
Graphdiyne (GDY) with a direct band gap, excellent carrier mobility and uniform pores, is regarded as a promising photocatalytic material for solar energy conversion, while the research on GDY in photocatalysis is a less developed field. Herein, the distinctive structure, adjustable band gap, and electronic properties of GDY for photocatalysis is firstly summarized. The construction and progress of GDY&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar energy conversion, including H2 evolution reaction (HER), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and N2 reduction reaction (NRR) are then elaborated. At last, the challenges and perspectives in developing GDY&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar fuel production are discussed. It is anticipated that a timely Minireview will be helpful for rapid progress of GDY in solar energy conversion.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Induced Spin State Switching in an FeIII Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;induced spin state switching of two FeIII complexes is reported. The change in spin state is reversible, recorded over several cycles with Evans&#8217; method 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Appending a diethylamino group to the ligand of one of the complexes allows for a colorimetric response from blue&#8208;black to bright pink upon protonation.







Abstract
Reversible proton&#8208;induced spin state switching of an FeIII complex in solution is observed at room temperature. A reversible magnetic response was detected in the complex, [FeIII(sal2323)]ClO4 (1), using Evans&#8217; method 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy which indicated cumulative switching from low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin upon addition of one and two equivalents of acid. Infrared spectroscopy suggests a coordination&#8208;induced spin state switching (CISSS) effect, whereby protonation displaces the metal&#8208;phenoxo donors. The analogous complex, [FeIII(4&#8208;NEt2&#8208;sal2323)]ClO4 (2), with a diethylamino group on the ligand, was used to combine the magnetic change with a colorimetric response. Comparison of the protonation responses of 1 and 2 reveals that the magnetic switching is caused by perturbation of the immediate coordination sphere of the complex. These complexes constitute a new class of analyte sensor which operate by magneto&#8208;modulation, and in the case of 2, also yield a colorimetric response.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Regulation of Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes: Engineering High&#8208;Efficiency Catalase Mimics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A correlation between the atomic structures of Co single&#8208;atom nanozymes and their catalase&#8208;like performance is established by both computational screening and experimental design. A strategy is elucidated for atomic&#8208;level regulation of Co single&#8208;atom nanozymes operating as catalase mimics.







Abstract
Nanozymes aim to mimic the highly evolved active centers of natural enzymes. Despite progress in nanozyme engineering, their catalytic performance is much less favorable compared with natural enzymes. This study shows that precise control over the atomic configuration of the active centers of Co single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) enables the rational regulation of their catalase&#8208;like performance guided by theorical calculations. The constructed Co&#8208;N3PS SAzyme exhibits an excellent catalase&#8208;like activity and kinetics, exceeding the representative controls of Co&#8208;based SAzymes with different atomic configurations. Moreover, we developed an ordered structure&#8208;oriented coordination design strategy for rationally engineering SAzymes and established a correlation between the structure and enzyme&#8208;like performance. This work demonstrates that precise control over the active centers of SAzymes is an efficient strategy to mimic the highly evolved active sites of natural enzymes.

         <title>Boradigermaallyl: (4+3) Cycloaddition&#8208;Initiated Boron Insertion into Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boradigermaallyl featuring a delocalized &#960;&#8208;bond shows a boron atom insertion into benzene at room temperature. The mechanism starts by a concerted (4+3) reaction between the germanium atoms of the digermaboraallyl and the 1,4&#8208;positions of a benzene molecule. Thus, boradigermaallyl acts as a highly reactive dienophile in this cycloaddition reaction with nonactivated benzene.







Abstract
The 2&#960; electron 1,3&#8208;dipole boradigermaallyl, valence&#8208;isoelectronic to an allyl cation, is synthesized from a bis(germylene). It reacts with benzene at room temperature by insertion of a boron atom into the benzene ring. Computational investigation of the mechanism shows the boradigermaallyl reacting with a benzene molecule in a concerted (4+3) or [&#960;4s+&#960;2s] cycloaddition reaction. Thus, the boradigermaallyl acts as a highly reactive dienophile in this cycloaddition reaction with nonactivated benzene as diene unit. This type of reactivity provides a novel platform for ligand assisted borylene insertion chemistry.

         <title>In situ Nucleation&#8208;Growth Strategy for Controllable Heterogeneous Supramolecular Polymerization of Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymers and Their Hierarchical Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported an in situ nucleation&#8208;growth strategy for the controllable heterogeneous supramolecular polymerization of liquid crystalline block copolymers. This strategy was demonstrated to be highly efficient and robust, and amphiphilic triblock copolymer&#8208;like supramolecular polymers were directly fabricated, which could spontaneously undergo high&#8208;level assembly to form hierarchical structures in a controllable manner.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly morphologies of subunits are largely governed by thermodynamics, which plays a less important role in dimensional control. Particularly for one&#8208;dimensional assemblies from block copolymers (BCPs), the negligible energy difference between short and long ones imposes great challenges in length control. Herein, we report that by incorporating additional polymers to induce in situ nucleation and trigger the subsequent growth, controllable supramolecular polymerization driven by mesogenic ordering effect could be realized from liquid crystalline BCPs. The length of the resultant fibrillar supramolecular polymers (SP) is controlled by tuning the ratio between nucleating and growing components. Depending on the choice of BCPs, the SPs can be homopolymer&#8208;like, heterogeneous triblock, and even pentablock copolymer&#8208;like. More interestingly, with insoluble BCP as a nucleating component, amphiphilic SPs are fabricated, which can undergo spontaneous hierarchical assembly.

         <title>Engineering Flexible Metal&#8208;Phenolic Networks with Guest Responsiveness via Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Competitive coordination of metal ions to phenolic ligands with multiple coordination sites and solute guests results in flexible metal&#8208;phenolic networks featuring guest&#8208;responsive behavior. This leads to a significant transformation in their coordination networks and hence properties, for example, controllable cargo release, and expands the rational design of flexible metal&#8208;organic materials.







Abstract
Flexible metal&#8208;organic materials are of growing interest owing to their ability to undergo reversible structural transformations under external stimuli. Here, we report flexible metal&#8208;phenolic networks (MPNs) featuring stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior to diverse solute guests. The competitive coordination of metal ions to phenolic ligands of multiple coordination sites and solute guests (e.g., glucose) primarily determines the responsive behavior of the MPNs, as revealed experimentally and computationally. Glucose molecules can be embedded into the dynamic MPNs upon mixing, leading to the reconfiguration of the metal&#8208;organic networks and thus changes in their physicochemical properties for targeting applications. This study expands the library of stimuli&#8208;responsive flexible metal&#8208;organic materials and the understanding of intermolecular interactions between metal&#8208;organic materials and solute guests, which is essential for the rational design of responsive materials for various applications.

         <title>Facile Access to Cyclopropylboronates via Stereospecific Deborylative Cyclization: A Leaving Group&#8208;Assisted Activation of Geminal Diborons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we reported a transition metal&#8208;free deborylative cyclization strategy, based on which two routes have been developed, generating racemic and enantioenriched cyclopropylboronates, respectively. The cyclization of geminal bis(boronates) bearing a leaving group was highly diastereoselective, tolerating various functional groups and heterocycles. When optically active epoxides were used as the starting materials, enantioenriched cyclopropylboronates could be efficiently prepared with &gt;99% stereospecificity. Mechanistic studies showed that the leaving group at the &#947;&#8208;position played a crucial role and significantly promoted the activation of the gem&#8208;diboron moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Immobilization of Nickel Ions on Covalent Organic Frameworks for Panchromatic Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;coordination design on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is an efficient strategy for elevating the photocatalytic activity of organic moiety. However, the rigid skeletons and densely layered stacking of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs cannot be flexibly adapted for specific conformations of metal complexes, thereby impairing the metal&#8208;COF cooperation. Here, we adopt a solvothermal method to immobilize nickel(II) ions into a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;containing 2D COF, forming a stable coordination motif. Such the complex remarkably enhances the photocatalytic performance, giving an optimized H2 evolution rate of as high as 51,300 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1, 2.5 times higher than the pristine COF. The evolved hydrogen gas can also be detected upon 700&#8208;nm light irradiation, while its analog synthesized by the traditional coordination method is photo&#8208;catalytically inert. This work provides a strategy for optimizing the metal&#8208;COF coordination system and strengthening a synergy for electronic regulation in photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel&#8208;based catalysts have been regarded as one of the most promising electrocatalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), however, their activity is largely limited by the inevitable self&#8208;oxidation reaction of Ni species (NSOR) during the UOR. Here, we proposed an interface chemistry modulation strategy to trigger the occurrence of UOR before the NSOR via constructing a 2D/2D heterostructure that consists of ultrathin NiO anchored Ru&#8208;Co dual&#8208;atom support (Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO). Operando spectroscopic characterizations confirm this unique triggering mechanism on the surface of Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO. Consequently, the fabricated catalyst exhibits outstanding UOR activity with a low potential of 1.288 V at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and remarkable long&#8208;term durability for more than 330 h operation. DFT calculations and spectroscopic characterizations demonstrate that the favorable electronic structure induced by this unique heterointerface endows the catalyst energetically more favorable for the UOR than the NSOR.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Inner Helmholtz Plane with a&#160;High Donor Additive for Efficient&#160;Anode Reversibility in Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs) is highly dependent on inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) chemistry. Notorious parasitic reactions containing hydrogen evolution (HER) and Zn dendrites both originate from abundant free H2O and random Zn deposition inside active IHP. Here, we report a universal high donor number (DN) additive pyridine (Py) with only 1 vol.% addition (Py&#8211;to&#8208;H2O volume ratio), for regulating molecule distribution inside IHP. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation verify that incorporated Py additive could tailor Zn2+ solvation sheath and exclude H2O molecules from IHP effectively, which is in favor of preventing H2O decomposition. Consequently, even at extreme conditions such as high depth of discharge (DOD) of 80%, the symmetric cell based on Py additive can sustain approximately 500 h long&#8208;term stability. This efficient strategy with high DN additives furnishes a promising direction for designing novel electrolytes and promoting the practical application of AZIBs, despite inevitably introducing trace organic additives.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluid Multivalent Magnetic Interface for High&#8208;Performance Isolation and Proteomic Profiling of Tumor&#8208;Derived Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isolation and analysis of tumor&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (T&#8208;EVs) are important for clinical cancer management. Here, we develop a fluid multivalent magnetic interface (FluidmagFace) in a microfluidic chip for high&#8208;performance isolation, release, and protein profiling of T&#8208;EVs. The FluidmagFace increases affinity by 105&#8208;fold with fluidity&#8208;enhanced multivalent binding to improve isolation efficiency by 13.9% compared with a non&#8208;fluid interface. Its anti&#8208;adsorption property and microfluidic hydrodynamic shear minimize contamination, increasing detection sensitivity by two orders of magnitude. Moreover, its reversibility and expandability allow high&#8208;throughput recovery of T&#8208;EVs for mass spectrometric protein analysis. With the chip, T&#8208;EVs are detected in all tested cancer samples with identification of differentially expressed proteins compared with healthy controls. The FluidmagFace opens a new avenue to isolation and release of targets for cancer diagnosis and biomarker discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Assembly of Metallacages and Their Supramolecular Catalysis Behaviors in Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a new strategy to improve the self&#8208;assembly efficiency of functional assemblies in a confined space and construct hybrid functional materials is a significant and fascinating endeavor. Herein, we present a highly efficient strategy for achieving the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of well&#8208;defined metallacages in microdroplets through continuous&#8208;flow microfluidic devices. The high efficiency and versatility of this approach are demonstrated by the generation of five representative metallacages in different solvents containing water, DMF, acetonitrile, and methanol in a few minutes with nearly quantitative yields, in contrast to the yields obtained with the hour&#8208;scale reaction time in a batch reactor. Then, a ring&#8208;opening catalytic reaction of the metallacages is selected as a model reaction for exploring supramolecular catalysis in microdroplets, and the catalytic yield is enhanced by 2.22&#8208;fold compared to that of the same reaction in the batch reactor. This work exhibits a new promising paradigm for the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;siRNA Nanohybrids for Enhanced Chemodynamic Therapy via Ferritin Heavy Chain Downregulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferrous iron (Fe2+) has more potent hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH)&#8208;generating ability than other Fenton&#8208;type metal ions, making Fe&#8208;based nanomaterials attractive for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). However, because Fe2+ can be converted by ferritin heavy chain (FHC) to nontoxic ferric form and then sequestered in ferritin, therapeutic outcomes of Fe&#8208;mediated CDT agents are still far from satisfactory. Here we report the synthesis of siRNA&#8208;embedded Fe0 nanoparticles (Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs) for self&#8208;reinforcing CDT via FHC downregulation. Upon internalization by cancer cells, pH&#8208;responsive Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs are degraded to release Fe2+ and FHC siRNA in acidic endo/lysosomes with the aid of oxygen (O2). The accompanied O2 depletion causes an intracellular pH decrease, which further promotes the degradation of Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs. In addition to initiating chemodynamic process, Fe2+&#8208;catalyzed &#8226;OH generation facilitates endo/lysosomal escape of siRNA by disrupting the membranes, enabling FHC downregulation&#8208;enhanced CDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene Mediates Charge Transfer between Lead Chromate and a Cobalt Cubane Cocatalyst for Photocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interfacial barrier of charge transferring from semiconductors to cocatalysts makes the photogenerated charges cannot be fully utilized, especially for the challenging water oxidation reaction. Herein, using cobalt cubane&#160;(Co4O4) molecules as water oxidation cocatalysts, we rationally assembled partially oxidized graphene (pGO), acting as a charge&#8208;transfer mediator, on the hole&#8208;accumulating {&#8208;101} facets of lead chromate (PbCrO4) crystal. The assembled pGO enables Co4O4 molecules preferably immobilized &#160;on the {&#8208;101} facets of PbCrO4 crystal, which is favorable for the photogenerated holes transferring from PbCrO4 to Co4O4. The surface charge&#8208;transfer efficiency of PbCrO4 was measured to be greatly boosted by selectively assembling of pGO between&#160;PbCrO4&#160;and&#160;Co4O4.&#160;&#160;An apparent quantum efficiency for photocatalytic water oxidation on the Co4O4/pGO/PbCrO4 photocatalyst exceeds 10% at 500 nm. The strategy of rationally assembling charge transfer mediator in this work provides a feasible way for accelerating charge transfer and&#160;utilization in semiconductor photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfonium Salts as Acceptors in Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photoactivation of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes has emerged as a sustainable, selective and versatile strategy for the generation of radical species. Electron&#8208;donor acceptor (EDA) complexation, however, imposes electronic constraints on the donor and acceptor components and this can limit the range of radicals that can be generated using the approach. New EDA complexation strategies exploiting sulfonium salts allow radicals to be generated from native functionality. For example, aryl sulfonium salts, formed by the activation of arenes, can serve as the acceptor components in EDA complexes due to their electron&#8208;deficient nature. This &#8216;sulfonium tag&#8217; approach relaxes the electronic constraints on the parent substrate and dramatically expands the range of radicals that can be generated using EDA complexation. In this review, these new applications of sulfonium salts will be introduced and the areas of chemical space rendered accessible through this innovation will be highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Complexes Featuring a cis&#8208;[M&#8649;U&#8647;M] Core (M = Rh, Ir): A New Route to Uranium&#8208;Metal Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although examples of multiple bonds between actinide elements and main&#8208;group elements are quite common, studies of the multiple bonds between actinide elements and transition metals are extremely rare owing to difficulties associated with their synthesis. Here we report the first example of molecular uranium complexes featuring a cis&#8208;[M&#8649;U&#8647;M] core (M = Rh, Ir), which exhibits an unprecedented arrangement of two M&#8649;U double dative bond linkages to a single U center. These complexes were prepared by the reactions of chlorine&#8208;bridged heterometallic complexes [{U{N(CH3)(CH2CH2NP i Pr2)2}(Cl)2[(&#956;&#8208;Cl)M(COD)]2}] (M = Rh, Ir) with MeMgBr or MeLi, a new method for the construction of species with U&#8208;M multiple bonds. Theoretical calculations at the DFT level including dispersion confirmed the presence of two U&#8647;M double dative bonds in these complexes. This study not only enriches the U&#8647;M multiple bond chemistry, but also provides a new opportunity to explore the bonding of actinide elements.</dc:description>

Theoretical calculations at the DFT level including dispersion confirmed the presence of two U&#8647;M double dative bonds in these complexes. This study not only enriches the U&#8647;M multiple bond chemistry, but also provides a new opportunity to explore the bonding of actinide elements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Metallosalphen&#8208;Based 2D Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for NO2 Sensing: Metal Coordination Induced Planarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As an emerging class of promising porous materials, the development of two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) is hampered by the few categories and tedious synthesis of the specific ligands. Herein, we developed a nonplanar hexahydroxyl&#8208;functionalized Salphen ligand (6OH&#8208;Salphen) through a facile two&#8208;step synthesis, which was further applied to construct layered 2D c&#8208;MOFs through in&#8208;situ one pot synthesis based on the synergistic metal binding effect of the N2O2 pocket of Salphen. Interestingly, the C2v&#8208;symmetry of ligand endows Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF with periodically heterogeneous pore structures. Benefitting from the higher metal density and shorter in&#8208;plane metal&#8208;metal distance, Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF showcased excellent NO2 sensing performance with good sensitivity, selectivity and reversibility. The current work opens up a new avenue to construct 2D c&#8208;MOF directly from nonplanar ligands, which greatly simplifies the synthesis and provides new possibilities for preparing different topological 2D c&#8208;MOF based functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Origin of the Activity Trend in the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethanol over VOx/CeO2
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using operando time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, we investigated the origin of the volcano&#8208;shaped activity trend in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol over VOx/CeO2 catalysts as a function of VOx surface coverage. Vanadium and cerium synergistically change their oxidation states during the catalytic cycle. The catalytic activity correlates with the concentration of reversible Ce4+/3+ species.







Abstract
Supported vanadia (VOx) is a versatile catalyst for various redox processes where ceria&#8208;supported VOx have shown to be particularly active in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alcohols. In this work, we clarify the origin of the volcano&#8208;shaped ethanol ODH activity trend for VOx/CeOx catalysts using operando quick V K&#8208; and Ce L3&#8208; edge XAS experiments performed under transient conditions. We quantitatively demonstrate that both vanadium and cerium are synergistically involved in alcohol ODH. The concentration of reversible Ce4+/Ce3+ species was identified as the main descriptor of the alcohol ODH activity. The activity drop in the volcano plot, observed at above ca. 3&#8197;V&#8201;nm&#8722;2 surface loading (ca. 30&#8201;% of VOx monolayer coverage), is related to the formation of spectator V4+ and Ce3+ species, which were identified here for the first time. These results might prove to be helpful for the rational optimization of VOx/CeO2 catalysts and the refinement of the theoretical models.

         <title>Excessive Iodine Enabled Ultrathin Inorganic Perovskite Growth at the Liquid&#8208;Air Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin inorganic perovskite nanosheets are prepared by liquid&#8208;air interfacial synthesis by adding only iodine into the precursor solution. The thickness, lateral size, defects, optical and optoelectronic properties of these freestanding materials are optimized by simply adjusting the iodine concentration of the solution.







Abstract
The liquid&#8208;air interface offers a platform for the in&#8208;plane growth of free&#8208;standing materials. However, it is rarely used for inorganic perovskites and ultrathin non&#8208;layered perovskites. Herein the liquid&#8208;air interfacial synthesis of inorganic perovskite nanosheets (Cs3Bi2I9, Cs3Sb2I9) is achieved simply by drop&#8208;casting the precursor solution with only the addition of iodine. The products are inaccessible without iodine addition. The thickness and lateral size of these nanosheets can be adjusted through the iodine concentration. The high volatility of the iodine spontaneously drives precursors that normally stay in the liquid to the liquid&#8208;air interface. The iodine also repairs in situ iodine vacancies during perovskite growth, giving enhanced optical and optoelectronic properties. The liquid&#8208;air interfacial growth of ultrathin perovskites provides multi&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom for constructing perovskite&#8208;based heterostructures and devices at atomic scale.

         <title>Ferroptosis Detection: From Approaches to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We systematically summarize the ferroptosis detection approaches for subcellular organelles, biological events, and chemical markers, providing a multi&#8208;scale perspective on the regulation of the molecular machinery of ferroptosis. Moreover, we highlight the potential of advanced applications that integrate ferroptosis detection techniques with multifunctional platforms. The development of these applications holds great promise in promoting the transition of ferroptosis research from bench to bedside.







Abstract
Understanding the intricate molecular machinery that governs ferroptosis and leveraging this accumulating knowledge could facilitate disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Emerging approaches for the in situ detection of the major regulators and biological events across cellular, tissue, and in living subjects provide a multiscale perspective for studying ferroptosis. Furthermore, advanced applications that integrate ferroptosis detection and the latest technologies hold tremendous promise in ferroptosis research. In this review, we first briefly summarize the mechanisms and key regulators underlying ferroptosis. Ferroptosis detection approaches are then presented to delineate their design, mechanisms of action, and applications. Special interest is placed on advanced ferroptosis applications that integrate multifunctional platforms. Finally, we discuss the prospects and challenges of ferroptosis detection approaches and applications, with the aim of providing a roadmap for the theranostic development of a broad range of ferroptosis&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Photochemical Activation of Peroxymonosulfate in Xanthene&#8208;Rich Systems for Fenton&#8208;Like Synergistic Decontamination: Efficacy of Proton Transfer Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable DPPA system for synergistic decontamination was proposed through selecting EB with xanthene structure as the model dye. The photo&#8208;electron transfer between excited dye and PMS triggered the activation process and significantly enhanced the production of reactive species. It was proved that the PTP was the crucial factor to determine the reactivity of DPPA system, mainly leading to the ISR and IDR of dye molecules.







Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;free visible light assisted Fenton&#8208;like catalysis offers opportunities to achieve the sustainable water decontamination, but the synergistic decontamination mechanisms are still unclear, especially the effect of proton transfer process (PTP). The conversion of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) in photosensitive dye&#8208;enriched system was detailed. The photo&#8208;electron transfer between excited dye and PMS triggered the efficient activation of PMS and enhanced the production of reactive species. Photochemistry behavior analysis and DFT calculations revealed that PTP was the crucial factor to determine the decontamination performance, leading to the transformation of dye molecules. The excitation process inducing activation of whole system was composed of low energy excitations, and the electrons and holes were almost contributed by LUMO and HOMO. This work provided new ideas for the design of catalyst&#8208;free sustainable system for efficient decontamination.

         <title>Computer&#8208;Aided Discovery of Potent Broad&#8208;Spectrum Vaccine Adjuvants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Au nanoparticle (AuNP) adjuvants are prepared through computer&#8208;aided molecule design and machine learning to discover agonist ligands, and sulfur&#8208;Au coordination chemistry guided well&#8208;ordered presentation of ligands on AuNP surface. These AuNP adjuvants show advantages in multi&#8208;toll like receptor (TLR) targeting and application as broad&#8208;spectrum adjuvants to boost robust multifaceted anti&#8208;tumor vaccine responses.







Abstract
Adjuvants stimulate the immune system to vigorously respond to a vaccine. While current adjuvants such as aluminum salts and oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions have been used for decades, they do not generate broad and long&#8208;lasting responses in many vaccines. Consequently, more potent adjuvants are needed. Here, using computer&#8208;aided molecule design and machine learning, we discovered 2 new, broad&#8208;spectrum adjuvants that can boost vaccine responses. Our library containing 46 toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR)&#8208;targeting agonist ligands were assembled on Au nanoparticles. Comprehensive in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies showed both leads promoted dendritic cell activation via multiple TLRs and enhanced antigen presentation to T cells. When used together with tumor&#8208;specific antigens to immunize mice against B16&#8208;OVA melanoma and 4T1&#8208;PD1 breast cancer, both adjuvants unleashed strong immune responses that suppressed tumor growth and lung metastases. Our results show computer&#8208;aided design and screening can rapidly uncover potent adjuvants for tackling waning immunity in current vaccines.

         <title>MALDI Imaging Assisted Discovery of a Di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosyltransferase from Platycodon grandiflorum Root</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MALDI MS imaging assisted genome screening strategy was developed and enabled the identification and characterization of a di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosyltransferase PgGT1 from Platycodon grandiflorum root.







Abstract
A matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) assisted genome mining strategy was developed for the discovery of glycosyltransferase (GT) from the root of Platycodon grandiflorum. A di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosyltransferase PgGT1 was discovered and characterized that is capable of catalyzing platycoside&#8197;E (PE) synthesis through the attachment of two &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;linked glucosyl residues sequentially to the glucosyl residue at the C3 position of platycodin&#8197;D (PD). Although UDP&#8208;glucose is the preferred sugar donor for PgGT1, it could also utilize UDP&#8208;xylose and UDP&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine as weak donors. Residues S273, E274, and H350 played important roles in stabilizing the glucose donor and positioning the glucose in the optimal orientation for the glycosylation reaction. This study clarified two key steps involved in the biosynthetic pathway of PE and could greatly contribute to improving its industrial biotransformation.

         <title>A Polarized Gel Electrolyte for Wide&#8208;Temperature Flexible Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarized gel electrolyte of polyacrylamide&#8208;sodium citric (PAM&#8208;SC) is synthesized for flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries. The polarized &#8722;COO&#8722; functional groups in gel electrolyte not only form an electrical field to suppress Zn dendrite growth, but also prevent water from freezing and evaporating. The FZABs with the PAM&#8208;SC gel electrolyte exhibit long cycling life of 700&#8197;cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, showing the application prospect under extreme conditions.







Abstract
The development of flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries (FZABs) has attracted broad attention in the field of wearable electronic devices. Gel electrolyte is one of the most important components in FZABs, which is urgent to be optimized to match with Zn anode and adapt to severe climates. In this work, a polarized gel electrolyte of polyacrylamide&#8208;sodium citric (PAM&#8208;SC) is designed for FZABs, in which the SC molecules contain large amount of polarized &#8722;COO&#8722; functional groups. The polarized &#8722;COO&#8722; groups can form an electrical field between gel electrolyte and Zn anode to suppress Zn dendrite growth. Besides, the &#8722;COO&#8722; groups in PAM&#8208;SC can fix H2O molecules, which prevents water from freezing and evaporating. The polarized PAM&#8208;SC hydrogel delivers a high ionic conductivity of 324.68&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and water retention of 96.85&#8201;% after being exposed for 96&#8197;h. FZABs with the PAM&#8208;SC gel electrolyte exhibit long cycling life of 700&#8197;cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, showing the application prospect under extreme conditions.

         <title>Anhydrous Superprotonic Conductivity in the Zirconium Acid Triphosphate ZrH5(PO4)3
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the discovery of a new crystalline acid Zr triphosphate which exhibits record&#8208;high proton conductivity of 0.5&#8211;3.1&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in anhydrous conditions (relative humiditiy, RH, &#8810;1&#8201;%). This value of anhydrous proton conductivity is unprecedent and could unlock applications in fuel cells without the need for complex water management systems, and in other energy technologies requiring fast proton transfer.







Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state proton conductors with high proton conductivity at low temperatures is crucial for the implementation of hydrogen&#8208;based technologies for portable and automotive applications. Here, we report on the discovery of a new crystalline metal acid triphosphate, ZrH5(PO4)3 (ZP3), which exhibits record&#8208;high proton conductivity of 0.5&#8211;3.1&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in the range 25&#8211;110&#8201;&#176;C in anhydrous conditions. This is the highest anhydrous proton conductivity ever reported in a crystalline solid proton conductor in the range 25&#8211;110&#8201;&#176;C. Superprotonic conductivity in ZP3 is enabled by extended defective frustrated hydrogen bond chains, where the protons are dynamically disordered over two oxygen centers. The high proton conductivity and stability in anhydrous conditions make ZP3 an excellent candidate for innovative applications in fuel cells without the need for complex water management systems, and in other energy technologies requiring fast proton transfer.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Atom&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Initiated Radical/Polar Crossover Annulation Cascade for Expedient Access to Complex Tetralins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A radical/polar&#8208;crossover&#8208;based annulation between allyl&#8208;substituted arenes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes is described. Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) facilitates tandem radical C&#8211;C bond formation that generates functionalized tetralin products in the face of potentially problematic hydrofluorination, hydroalkoxylation, hydrogenation, alkene isomerization, and radical polymerization reactions. The reactions proceed under mild conditions that tolerate many functional groups, leading to broad substrate scope. This powerful ring&#8208;forming reaction very quickly assembles complex tetralins that are the formal products of the largely infeasible Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions of styrenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkali&#8208;Metal&#8208;Alkoxide Powered Zincation of Fluoroarenes Employing Zinc Bis&#8208;Amide Zn(TMP)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reminiscent of Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser superbase recipes, the addition of two molar equivalents of KOtBu to Zn(TMP)2(TMP&#160;= 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide)&#160;transforms this mild zinc&#160;bis&#8208;amide base to a powerful metalating agent able to perform facile regioselective zincation of a wide range of sensitive fluoroarenes. Structural authentication of the intermediates post Zn&#8208;H exchange demonstrates activation of both TMP groups to form a range of higher order bis&#8208;aryl potassium zincates, isolable as solids and further functionalized in electrophilic interception reactions. Studies assessing the role of KOtBu reveal that the first equivalent undergoes co&#8208;complexation with Zn(TMP)2, enabling kinetic activation of the amide groups; whereas the second equivalent stabilizes the metalated intermediate preventing ligand redistribution. Showcasing its metalating power, this bimetallic KOtBu/Zn(TMP)2&#160;partnership, can effect &#160;zincation of toluene and benzene at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of carbazole dendronized tri(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radicals were synthesized. The photophysical properties of up to 4th generations of radical dendrimers were compared systematically to understand how structure&#8208;property relationships evolve with generation. Photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was found to increase with the increasing generation, and the fourth generation (G4TTM) in cyclohexane solution showed PLQY as high as 60% at a wavelength of 627 nm in the deep red region from the doublet state. The dendron modification strategy also showed a blue&#8208;shift of the emission when increasing the generation, and the photostability has also increased compared to the bare TTM radical.</dc:description>

         <title>Dopant&#8208;free NiOx Nanocrystals: A Low&#8208;cost and Stable Hole Transport&#160;Material for Commercializing Perovskite Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advancing inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is critical for commercial applications given their compatibility with different bottom cells for tandem photovoltaics, low&#8208;temperature processability (&#8804;100 &#176;C), and promising operational stability. Although inverted PSCs have achieved an efficiency of over 25% using doped or expensive organic hole transporting materials (HTMs), their fabrication cost and stability still cannot meet the requirements for their commercialization. Recently, dopant&#8208;free and low&#8208;cost non&#8208;stoichiometric nickel oxide nanocrystals (NiOx NCs) have been extensively studied as a low&#8208;cost and effective HTM in perovskite optoelectronics. In this minireview, we summarize the synthesis and surface&#8208;functionalization methods for NiOx NCs. Then, the applications of NiOx NCs in other perovskite optoelectronics beyond photovoltaics are discussed. Finally, we provide a perspective for the future development of NiOx NCs for the commercialization of perovskite optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abiotic synthesis of formate and short hydrocarbons takes place in serpentinizing vents where some members of vent microbial communities live on abiotic formate as their main carbon source. To better understand the catalytic properties of Ni&#8208;Fe minerals that naturally exist in hydrothermal vents, we have investigated the ability of synthetic Ni&#8208;Fe based nanoparticular solids to catalyze the H2&#8208;dependent reduction of CO2, the first step required for the beginning of pre&#8208;biotic chemistry. Mono and bimetallic Ni&#8208;Fe nanoparticles with varied Ni&#8208;to&#8208;Fe ratios transform CO2 and H2 into intermediates and products of the acetyl&#8208;coenzyme A pathway &#8212; formate, acetate, and pyruvate &#8212; in mM range under mild hydrothermal conditions. Furthermore, Ni&#8208;Fe catalysts converted CO2 to similar products without molecular H2 by using water as a hydrogen source. Both CO2 chemisorption analysis and post&#8208;reaction characterization of materials indicate that Ni and Fe metals play complementary roles for CO2 fixation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogenous catalyzed N&#8208;formylation of amines to formamide with CO2/H2 has been highly attractive on the valorization of the CO2. However, the relationship of the catalytic performance with the catalyst structure is still elusive. Herein, the mixed&#8208;valence catalysts containing Cu2O/Cu interface sites were constructed for this transformation. Both aliphatic primary and secondary amines with diverse structures were efficiently converted into the desired formamides with good to excellent yields. Combined ex and in situ catalyst characterizations revealed that the presence of Cu2O/Cu interface sites was vital for the excellent catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that better catalytic activity of Cu2O/Cu(111) than Cu(111) can be attributed to the assistance of oxygen at the Cu2O/Cu interface (Ointer) in formation of Ointer&#8208;H moieties, which not only reduce the apparent barrier of HCOOH formation but also benefit the desorption of the desired N&#8208;formylated amine, leading to the high activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Acid/alkali All Covalent Organic Frameworks Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid acid/alkali all&#8208;COFs battery was developed by coupling pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone based COF cathode with anthraquinone based COF anode, presenting excellent electrochemical performances with wide voltage window, high capacity and good cyclic stability.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), thanks to their adjustable porous structure and abundant build&#8208;in functional motifs, have been recently regarded as promising electrode materials for a variety of batteries. There still remain grand opportunities to further utilizing their merits for developing advanced COFs&#8208;based batteries. In this paper, we propose a hybrid acid/alkali all&#8208;COFs battery by coupling pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone based COF cathode with anthraquinone based COF anode. In such a hybrid acid/alkali all&#8208;COFs battery, the cathodic COF favorably works in acid with a relatively positive potential, while the anodic COF preferably runs in alkali with a relatively negative potential. It thus can deliver a decently high discharge capacity of 92.97&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a wide voltage window of 2.0&#8197;V, and exhibit high energy density of 74.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 along with a considerable cyclic stability over 300 cycles. The development of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept all&#8208;COFs battery may drive forward the improvement of newly cost&#8208;effective and performance&#8208;reliable energy storage devices.

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination of Iridium Single&#8208;atom IrN3O Boosting Formic Acid Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated a rational catalyst design process by integrating theoretical prediction and experimental realization. Asymmetrically coordinated iridium single atoms IrN3O embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon frameworks are unambiguously revealed for the optimum formic acid electro&#8208;oxidation catalysis, which reaches a peak current of 20.04&#8197;A&#8201;mgIr&#8722;1, 167&#8197;times superior to that of the Ir/C nanocatalyst.







Abstract
Rational design of the proximal coordination of an active site to achieve its optimum catalytic activity is the ultimate goal in single&#8208;atom catalysis, but still challenging. Here, we report theoretical prediction and experimental realization of an asymmetrically coordinated iridium single&#8208;atom catalyst (IrN3O) for the formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR). Theoretical calculations reveal that the substitution of one or two nitrogen with more electronegative oxygen in the symmetric IrN4 motif splits and downshifts the Ir 5d orbitals with respect to the Fermi level, moderating the binding strength of key intermediates on IrN4&#8722;xOx (x=1, 2) sites, especially that the IrN3O motif shows ideal activity for FAOR with a near&#8208;zero overpotential. The as&#8208;designed asymmetric Ir motifs were realized by pyrolyzing Ir precursor with oxygen&#8208;rich glucose and nitrogen&#8208;rich melamine, exhibiting a mass activity of 25 and 87 times greater than those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pd/C and Pt/C, respectively.

         <title>Polymerization Strategies to Construct a 3D Polymer Passivation Network toward High Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;dimensional polymer passivation network was constructed by combining the bulk in situ polymerization and surface pre&#8208;polymerization/secondary polymerization strategies. The all&#8208;rounded passivation structure increased carrier diffusion length, promoted energy level alignment and carrier injection. Corresponding devices achieve a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.194&#8197;V with an efficiency over 24&#8201;%, and module also achieves an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;%.







Abstract
The spontaneously formed uncoordinated Pb2+ defects usually make the perovskite films demonstrate strong n&#8208;type with relatively lower carrier diffusion length and serious non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss. In this work, we adopt different polymerization strategies to construct three&#8208;dimensional passivation frameworks in the perovskite layer. Thanks to the strong C&#8801;N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pb coordination bonding and the penetrating passivation structure, the defect state density is obviously reduced, accompanied by a significant increase in the carrier diffusion length. Additionally, the reduction of iodine vacancies also changed the Fermi level of the perovskite layer from strong n&#8208;type to weak n&#8208;type, which substantially promotes the energy level alignment and carrier injection efficiency. As a result, the optimized device achieved an efficiency exceeded 24&#8201;% (the certified efficiency is 24.16&#8201;%) with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.194&#8197;V, and the corresponding module achieved an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;%.

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of AIEgen&#8208;based Porous Organic Polymer Films by Interfacial Amino&#8208;yne Click Polymerization for Efficient Light&#8208;Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

This work presents a catalyst&#8208;free, atom&#8208;economical interfacial amino&#8208;yne click polymerization to in situ synthesize new AIEgen&#8208;based free&#8208;standing POP films at room temperature. These POP films show bright luminescence with high PLQY up to 37.8&#8201;% and can encapsulate the organic dyes to form efficient artificial light&#8208;harvesting thin films.







Abstract
We developed a catalyst&#8208;free, atom&#8208;economical interfacial amino&#8208;yne click polymerization to in situ synthesize new aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based free&#8208;standing porous organic polymer films at room temperature. The crystalline properties of POP films were confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. The good porosity of these POP films was proved by their N2 uptake experiments. The thickness of POP films can be easily regulated from 16&#8197;nm to &#8776;1&#8197;&#956;m by adjusting monomer concentration. More importantly, these AIEgen&#8208;based POP films show bright luminescence with high absolute photoluminescent quantum yields up to 37.8&#8201;% and good chemical and thermal stability. The AIEgen&#8208;based POP film can encapsulate an organic dye (e.g., Nile red) to further form an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with a large red&#8208;shift (&#916;&#955;=141&#8197;nm), highly efficient energy&#8208;transfer ability (&#934;ET=91&#8201;%), and high antenna effect (11.3).

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly Induced Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence of Copper Nanoclusters Using DNA Nanoribbon Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) are attractive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emitters as Cu is comparatively inexpensive, nontoxic, and highly abundant. However, their ECL yield is relatively low. Herein, we report that orderly self&#8208;assembly of CuNCs using DNA nanoribbon as the template (DNR/CuNCs) conferred the CuNCs with improved ECL properties compared with individual CuNCs in both annihilation and co&#8208;reactant processes. The DNR/CuNCs resulted in a high ECL yield of 46.8% in K2S2O8, which was ~ 68 times higher than that of individual CuNCs. This strategy was successfully extended to other ECL emitters, such as gold nanoclusters and the Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA system. Furthermore, as an application of DNR/CuNCs, a DNR/CuNC&#8208;based ECL biosensor with higher sensitivity was constructed for dopamine determination (two orders of magnitude lower than that previously reported), showing that DNR/CuNCs have a potential for application in ECL bioanalysis as a new type of superior luminophore candidate.</dc:description>

Whereas many of these techniques were developed for big data applications, the nature of experimental organic chemistry often confines practitioners to small datasets. Herein, we touch upon the limitations associated with small data in ML and emphasize the impact of bias and variance on constructing reliable predictive models. We aim to raise awareness to these possible pitfalls, and thus, provide an introductory guideline for good practice. Ultimately, we stress the great value associated with statistical analysis of small data, which can be further boosted by adopting a holistic data&#8208;centric approach in chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Carrier Diffusion Enables Efficient Back&#8208;Contact Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Back&#8208;contact architectures offer a promising route to improve record efficiencies of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by eliminating parasitic light absorption. However, the performance of back&#8208;contact PSCs is limited by inadequate carrier diffusion in perovskite. Here, we report that perovskite films with a preferred out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation show improved carrier dynamic properties. With the addition of guanidine thiocyanate, the films exhibit carrier lifetimes and mobilities increased by 3 &#8208; 5 times, leading to diffusion lengths exceeding 7 mm.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Back-contact architectures offer a promising route to improve record efficiencies of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by eliminating parasitic light absorption. However, the performance of back-contact PSCs is limited by inadequate carrier diffusion in perovskite. Here, we report that perovskite films with a preferred out-of-plane orientation show improved carrier dynamic properties. With the addition of guanidine thiocyanate, the films exhibit carrier lifetimes and mobilities increased by 3 - 5 times, leading to diffusion lengths exceeding 7 mm. The enhanced carrier diffusion results from substantial suppression of nonradiative recombination and improves charge collection. Devices using such films achieve reproducible efficiencies reaching 11.2%, among the best performances for back-contact PSCs. Our findings demonstrate the impact of carrier dynamics on back-contact PSCs and provide the basis for a new route to high-performance back-contact perovskite optoelectronic devices at low cost.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Breakthrough Separation of 2&#8208;Butene Isomers with High Dynamic Selectivity and Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing porous sorbents&#160;represents a potential energy&#8208;efficient way for industrial gas separation.&#160;However, a bottleneck for reducing the energy penalty is the trade&#8208;off between dynamic adsorption capacity and selectivity. Herein, we showed this problem can be overcome by modulating the kinetic and thermodynamic separation behaviours in metal&#8208;organic frameworks for sieving 2&#8208;butene geometric isomers, which are desired for upgrading the raffinates to higher value&#8208;added end products. We found that the iron&#8208;triazolate framework can realize the selective shape screening of 2&#8208;butene isomers assisted by electrostatic interactions at the pore apertures. Further introducing uncoordinated N binding sites by ligand substitution lowered the gas diffusion barrier and greatly boosted the dynamic separation&#160;performance. In breakthrough tests under ambient conditions, trans&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 can be efficiently separated from cis&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 with a record capacity of 2.10 mmol/g with high dynamic selectivity of 2.39.</dc:description>

         <title>Driving Polymer Brushes from Synthesis to Functioning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The great success of controlled radical polymerizations has encouraged researchers to develop more facile and robust approaches for surface&#8208;initiated polymerizations (SIPs) to fabricate polymer brushes, even for non&#8208;experts. In recent years, external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;mediated radical polymerization methods have come to the fore as SIPs because of their less rigorous synthetic procedures and high controllability, which expand the opportunities for synthesizing macromolecules with desired chemical compositions and structures, as well as tailor&#8208;made polymers and bioconjugates that show broad applicability and physiological compatibility. This review discusses the latest developments in surface&#8208;initiated polymerization methods, in particular, external&#8208;stimuli mediated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), photo&#8208;induced polymerizations, and reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, as well as other methods and their combination for the application in surface grafting. The implementation of these methods is of great interest due to their unique possibilities to temporally control a polymerization process, fast and straightforward polymerization, and environmentally benign features, which lead to established and emerging applications in biolubrication, antifouling, and biosensing.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dissipative Reaction Network Drives Transient Solid&#8208;Liquid and Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Cycling of Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transient states maintained by energy dissipation are an essential feature of dynamic systems where structures and functions are regulated by fluxes of energy and matter through chemical reaction networks. Perfected in biology, chemically fueled dissipative networks incorporating nanoscale components allow the unique properties of nanomaterials to be bestowed with spatiotemporal adaptability and chemical responsiveness. We report the transient dispersion of gold nanoparticles in water, powered by dissipation of a chemical fuel. A dispersed state that is generated under nonequilibrium conditions permits fully reversible solid&#8211;liquid or liquid&#8211;liquid phase transfer. The molecular basis of the out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium process is reversible covalent modification of nanoparticle&#8208;bound ligands by a simple inorganic activator. Activator consumption by a coupled dissipative reaction network leads to autonomous cycling between phases. The out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium lifetime is tunable by adjusting pH, and reversible phase cycling is reproducible over several cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>A Facile Strategy for the Development of Recyclable Multifunctional Liquid Crystal Polymers via Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification and Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM) offers a versatile approach for engineering multifunctional polymers, but this advantage has not been fully exploited to fabricate multifunctional liquid crystal polymers (LCPs). Here, we design a facile synthetic approach towards multifunctional LCP by combining the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) with PPM, in which ROMP helps to prepare a reactive LCP precursor with high molecular weight, and PPM provides a facilitation to introduce functional groups into the precursor. Consequently, a photo&#8208; and humidity&#8208;responsive linear LCP (LLCP) is demonstrated to show the potential of this synthetic strategy to diversify functions of the LCPs. Under light irradiation and humidity changes, the deformation modes of the LLCP films are converted to complex shapes (bending, twisting, and curling). The obtained dual&#8208;responsive LLCP with high molecular weight possesses excellent processability and recyclability, making it possible to construct 3D shape actuators with programmable deformation behaviors under light/humidity.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Organic&#8208;Cation Defects on Optoelectronic Properties of ASnI3 Perovskites A=HC(NH2)2, CH3NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve higher power conversion efficiency for tin organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites the critical role of organic defects in nonradiative recombination should be better understood. Random rotation of organic cation can suppress nonradiative carrier trapping owing to organic defects in FASnI3 [FA=HC(NH2)2], rendering the organic contributions for defect tolerance. In contrast, organic defects in MASnI3 (MA=CH3NH3) are strong and active trapping centers.







Abstract
Tin organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites (tin OIHPs) possess a desirable band gap and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached 14&#8201;%. A commonly held view is that the organic cations in tin OIHPs would have little impact on the optoelectronic properties. Herein, we show that the defective organic cations with randomly dynamic characteristics can have marked effect on optoelectronic properties of the tin OIHPs. Hydrogen vacancies originated from the proton dissociation from FA [HC(NH2)2] in FASnI3 can induce deep transition levels in the band gap but yield relatively small nonradiative recombination coefficients of 10&#8722;15&#8197;cm3&#8201;s&#8722;1, whereas those from MA (CH3NH3) in MASnI3 can yield much larger nonradiative recombination coefficients of 10&#8722;11&#8197;cm3&#8201;s&#8722;1. Additional insight into the &#8220;defect tolerance&#8221; is gained by disentangling the correlations between dynamic rotation of organic cations and charge&#8208;carrier dynamics.

         <title>Computational Evolution Of New Catalysts For The Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Reaction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalyst of the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman was discovered using a graph&#8208;based genetic algorithm. The catalytic activity was experimentally verified by a kinetic study and the newly discovered catalysts outcompetes a widely used catalyst for this reaction.







Abstract
We present a de novo discovery of an efficient catalyst of the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction by searching chemical space for molecules that lower the estimated barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step using a genetic algorithm (GA) starting from randomly selected tertiary amines. We identify 435 candidates, virtually all of which contain an azetidine N as the catalytically active site, which is discovered by the GA. Two molecules are selected for further study based on their predicted synthetic accessibility and have predicted rate&#8208;determining barriers that are lower than that of a known catalyst. Azetidines have not been used as catalysts for the MBH reaction. One suggested azetidine is successfully synthesized and showed an eightfold increase in activity over a commonly used catalyst. We believe this is the first experimentally verified de novo discovery of an efficient catalyst using a generative model.

         <title>Practical and General Alcohol Deoxygenation Protocol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for alcohol deoxygenation that functions across a wide range of alcohol structures is reported. This approach combines the reductive potency of carbon dioxide radical anion with acidic additives to promote the kinetically slow C(sp3)&#8722;O bond cleavage.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a practical protocol for the removal of alcohol functional groups through reductive cleavage of their benzoate ester analogs. This transformation requires a strong single electron transfer (SET) reductant and a means to accelerate slow fragmentation following substrate reduction. To accomplish this, we developed a photocatalytic system that generates a potent reductant from formate salts alongside Br&#248;nsted or Lewis acids that promote fragmentation of the reduced intermediate. This deoxygenation procedure is effective across structurally and electronically diverse alcohols and enables a variety of difficult net transformations. This protocol requires no precautions to exclude air or moisture and remains efficient on multigram scale. Finally, the system can be adapted to a one&#8208;pot benzoylation&#8208;deoxygenation sequence to enable direct alcohol deletion. Mechanistic studies validate that the role of acidic additives is to promote the key C(sp3)&#8722;O bond fragmentation step.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Adsorbed Polymer&#8208;Electrolyte Interphases for Stabilizing Metal Anodes in Aqueous Zn and Non&#8208;Aqueous Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optimized PEG adsorption interphases realize highly reversible Zn/Li anodes. The organic/inorganic SEI layer induced by the adsorbed PEG interphases plays a key role in the stability of the metal anode and the low N/P ratio full cells.







Abstract
Polymers are known to adsorb spontaneously from liquid solutions in contact with high&#8208;energy substrates to form configurationally complex, but robust phases that often exhibit higher durability than might be expected from the individual physical bonds formed with the substrate. Rational control of the physical, chemical, and transport properties of such interphases has emerged as a fundamental opportunity for scientific and technological advances in energy storage technology but requires in&#8208;depth understanding of the conformation states and electrochemical effect of the adsorbed polymers. Here, we analyze the interfacial adsorption of oligomeric polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains of moderate sizes dissolved in protic and aprotic liquid electrolytes and find that there is an optimum polymer molecular weight of approximately 400&#8197;Da at which the highest columbic efficiency is achieved for both Zn and Li deposition. These findings point to a simple, versatile approach for extending the lifetime of batteries.

         <title>Cationic Tetrylene&#8208;Iron(0) Complexes: Access Points for Cooperative, Reversible Bond Activation and Open&#8208;Shell Iron(&#8722;I) Ferrato&#8208;Tetrylenes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic tetrylene centres, built into a chelating ligand framework, allow for the formation of reactive CO&#8208;free iron(0) complexes. For Sn, a highly reactive high&#8208;spin, open&#8208;shell d8 complex is formed, capable of the cooperative, reversible activation of H2 at the Sn&#8722;Fe interface. Both EII&#8722;Fe0 complexes (E=Ge, Sn) also undergo one&#8208;electron reduction to form unique iron(&#8722;I) ferrato&#8208;tetrylenes, a compound class which was previously unknown.







Abstract
The open&#8208;shell cationic stannylene&#8208;iron(0) complex 4 (4=[PhiPDippSn&#8901;Fe&#8901;IPr]+; PhiPDipp={[Ph2PCH2Si(iPr)2](Dipp)N}; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; IPr=[(Dipp)NC(H)]2C:) cooperatively and reversibly cleaves dihydrogen at the Sn&#8722;Fe interface under mild conditions (1.5&#8197;bar, 298&#8197;K), in forming bridging hydrido&#8208;complex 6. The One&#8208;electron oreduction of the related GeII&#8722;Fe0 complex 3 leads to oxidative addition of one C&#8722;P linkage of the PhiPDipp ligand in an intermediary Fe&#8722;I complex, leading to FeI phosphide species 7. One&#8208;electron reduction reaction of 4 gives access to the iron(&#8722;I) ferrato&#8208;stannylene, 8, giving evidence for the transient formation of such a species in the reduction of 3. The covalently bound tin(II)&#8208;iron(&#8722;I) compound 8 has been characterised through EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry, and supporting computational analysis, which strongly indicate a high localization of electron spin density at Fe&#8722;I in this unique d9&#8208;iron complex.

         <title>Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;Extended Double [9]Helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented &#960;&#8208;extended double [9]helicene D9H with D2 symmetry has been synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. D9H exhibits a high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;=18&#8201;%) in the near&#8208;infrared region and notable dissymmetry factor (gCD=0.019) in the visible region.







Abstract
Double helicenes are appealing chiral frameworks. Their &#960;&#8208;extension is desirable to achieve (chir)optical response in the visible and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, but access to higher double [n]helicenes (n&#8805;8) has remained challenging. Herein, we report an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;extended double [9]helicene (D9H), unambiguously revealing its structure by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. D9H shows remarkable NIR emission from 750 to 1100&#8197;nm with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 18&#8201;%. In addition, optically pure D9H exhibits panchromatic circular dichroism with a notable dissymmetry factor (gCD) of 0.019 at 590&#8197;nm, which is among the highest in the visible region for reported helicenes.

In addition, optically pure &lt;b&gt;D9H&lt;/b&gt; exhibits panchromatic circular dichroism with a notable dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CD&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.019 at 590&#8197;nm, which is among the highest in the visible region for reported helicenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Multiresponsive Functional AIEgen for Spatiotemporal Pattern Control and All&#8208;round Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chromone&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorogen called CPVCM which can undergo a specific amination with primary amines and photoarrangement under UV irradiation at the same active site were reported, along with its applications of developing multiple&#8208;colored images, a quick response code with dynamic colors and an all&#8208;round information encryption system which indicated the properties of multiple controls and responses.







Abstract
Functional materials with multi&#8208;responsive properties and good controllability are highly desired for developing bioinspired and intelligent multifunctional systems. Although some chromic molecules have been developed, it is still challenging to realize in situ multicolor fluorescence changes based on a single luminogen. Herein, we reported an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogen called CPVCM, which can undergo a specific amination with primary amines to trigger luminescence change and photoarrangement under UV irradiation at the same active site. Detailed mechanistic insights were carried out to illustrate the reactivity and reaction pathways. Accordingly, multiple&#8208;colored images, a quick response code with dynamic colors, and an all&#8208;round information encryption system were demonstrated to show the properties of multiple controls and responses. It is believed that this work not only provides a strategy to develop multiresponsive luminogens but also develops an information encryption system based on luminescent materials.

         <title>Contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis for Direct Synthesis of H2O2 under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an indispensable basic reagent in various industries, such as textile bleach, chemical synthesis, and environmental protection. However, it is challenging to prepare H2O2 in a green, safe, simple and efficient way under ambient conditions. Here, we found that H2O2 could be synthesized using a catalytic pathway only by contact charging a two&#8208;phase interface at room temperature and normal pressure. Particularly, under the action of mechanical force, electron transfer occurs during physical contact between polytetrafluoroethylene particles and deionized water/O2 interfaces, inducing the generation of reactive free radicals (&#183;OH and &#183;O2&#8208;), and the free radicals could react to form H2O2, yielding as high as 313 &#956;mol L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. In addition, the new reaction device could show long&#8208;term stable H2O2 production. This work provides a novel method for the efficient preparation of H2O2, which may also stimulate further explorations on contact&#8208;electrification&#8208;induced chemistry process.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Intermolecular Coupling of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Allenes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new protocols for regiodivergent and enantioselective coupling of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes and aldehydes promoted by easily accessible Co complexes were developed. These processes represent the first example of transformations through enantioselective oxidative cyclization of allenes and aldehydes with diverse regioselectivities accurately controlled by chiral ligands.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective coupling of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes and aldehydes through regiodivergent oxidative cyclization followed by stereoselective protonation or reductive elimination promoted by chiral phosphine&#8208;Co complexes is presented. Such processes represent unprecedented and unique reaction pathways for Co catalysis that enable catalytic enantioselective generation of metallacycles with divergent regioselectivity accurately controlled by chiral ligands, affording a wide range of allylic alcohols and homoallylic alcohols that are otherwise difficult to access without the need of pre&#8208;formation of stoichiometric amounts of alkenyl&#8208; and allyl&#8208;metal reagents in up to 92&#8201;% yield, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 regioselectivity, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 dr and &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 er.

         <title>Exciton Localization for Highly Luminescent Two&#8208;Dimensional Tin&#8208;Based Hybrid Perovskites through Tin Vacancy Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal and efficient Sn2+ vacancy tuning strategy is proposed to achieve strongly localized excitons in two&#8208;dimensional (OA)2SnI4 (OA=octylammonium) perovskite nanosheets by separating corner&#8208;sharing [SnI6]4&#8722; octahedra, thereby promoting their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to &#8776;64&#8201;%, which is among the highest values reported thus far for tin iodide perovskites.







Abstract
Exciton localization is an approach for preparing highly luminescent semiconductors. However, realizing strongly localized excitonic recombination in low&#8208;dimensional materials such as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites remains challenging. Herein, we first propose a simple and efficient Sn2+ vacancy (VSn) tuning strategy to enhance excitonic localization in 2D (OA)2SnI4 (OA=octylammonium) perovskite nanosheets (PNSs), increasing their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to &#8776;64&#8201;%, which is among the highest values reported for tin iodide perovskites. Combining experimental with first&#8208;principles calculation results, we confirm that the significantly increased PLQY of (OA)2SnI4 PNSs is primarily due to self&#8208;trapped excitons with highly localized energy states induced by VSn. Moreover, this universal strategy can be applied for improving other 2D Sn&#8208;based perovskites, thereby paving a new way to fabricate diverse 2D lead&#8208;free perovskites with desirable PL properties.

         <title>Tailoring the Asymmetric Structure of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Light&#8208;promoted Selective and Efficient Gold Extraction and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely controlling the MOF structure, the electronic structure of the amino group was optimized to act as a double donor of electrons and protons in the process of gold reduction and desorption, thus realizing the selective adsorption, rapid reduction and efficient recovery of gold ions in electronic waste.







Abstract
Designing adsorption materials with high adsorption capacities and selectivities is highly desirable for precious metal recovery. Desorption performance is also particularly crucial for subsequent precious metal recovery and adsorbent regeneration. Herein, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) material (NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) with an asymmetric electronic structure of the central zirconium oxygen cluster has an exceptional gold extraction capacity of 2.04&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 under light irradiation. The selectivity of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 for gold ions is up to 98.8&#8201;% in the presence of interfering ions. Interestingly, the gold ions adsorbed on the surface of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 spontaneously reduce in situ, undergo nucleation and growth and finally achieve the phase separation of high&#8208;purity gold particles from NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66. The desorption and separation efficiency of gold particles from the adsorbent surface reaches 89&#8201;%. Theoretical calculations indicate that &#8208;NH2 functions as a dual donor of electrons and protons, and the asymmetric structure of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 leads to energetically advantageous multinuclear gold capture and desorption. This adsorption material can greatly facilitate the recovery of gold from wastewater and can easily realize the recycling of the adsorbent.

         <title>Unlocking a (Pseudo)&#8208;Mechanically Interlocked Molecule with a Coronene &#8220;Shoehorn&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM) comprising a tetragold metallobox and a tetraoctynyl&#8208;pyrene guest that can be regarded as a pseudo&#8208;metallosuit[4]ane is described. In contrast to other MIMs, the tetrasubstituted guest can be released from this molecule by the addition of coronene through a &#8220;shoehorning&#8221; mechanism.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) have gained increasing interest during the last decades, not only because of their aesthetic appeal, but also because their unique properties have allowed them to find applications in nanotechnology, catalysis, chemosensing and biomedicine. Herein we describe how a pyrene molecule with four octynyl substituents can be easily encapsulated within the cavity of a tetragold(I) rectangle&#8208;like metallobox, by template formation of the metallo&#8208;assembly in the presence of the guest. The resulting assembly behaves as a mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM), in which the four long limbs of the guest protrude from the entrances of the metallobox, thus locking the guest inside the cavity of the metallobox. The new assembly resembles a metallo&#8208;suit[4]ane, given the number of protruding long limbs and the presence of the metal atoms in the host molecule. However, unlike normal MIMs, this molecule can release the tetra&#8208;substituted pyrene guest by the addition of coronene, which can smoothly replace the guest in the cavity of the metallobox. Combined experimental and computational studies allowed the role of the coronene molecule in facilitating the release of the tetrasubstituted pyrene guest to be explained, through a process that we named &#8220;shoehorning&#8221;, as the coronene compresses the flexible limbs of the guest so that it can reduce its size to slide in and out the metallobox.

         <title>Revealing the Interfacial Chemistry of Fluoride Alkyl Magnesium Salts in Magnesium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring promising electrolyte&#8208;system with high reversible Mg plating/stripping and excellent stability is essential for rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs). Fluoride alkyl magnesium salts (Mg(ORF)2) not only possess high solubility in ether solvents but also compatible with Mg metal anode, thus hold a vast application prospect. Herein, a series of diverse Mg(ORF)2 were synthesized, among them, perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butanol magnesium (Mg(PFTB)2)/AlCl3/MgCl2 based electrolyte demonstrates highest oxidation stability, and promotes the in&#8208;situ formation of robust solid electrolyte interface. Consequently, the fabricated symmetric cell sustains a long&#8208;term cycling over 2000 h, and asymmetric cell exhibits a stable Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% over 3000 cycles. Furthermore, the Mg||Mo6S8 full cell maintains a stable cycling over 500 cycles. This work presents guidance for understanding structure&#8208;property relationships and electrolyte applications of fluoride alkyl magnesium salts.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;(Morpholine&#8208;4&#8208;dithio)phthalimide: A Shelf&#8208;Stable, Bilateral Platform Molecule Enabling Access to Diverse Unsymmetrical Disulfides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shelf&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare disulfurating reagent with chemoselectively displaceable amino and imide leaving groups is described. Protonation of this reagent promotes exclusive displacement of the amino group with various neutral carbon nucleophiles. The resulting dithiophthalimides are amenable to diverse substitution reactions under basic or neutral conditions, thus enabling expedient access to structurally diverse unsymmetrical disulfides.







Abstract
Synthetic methods for unsymmetrical disulfides are greatly needed owing to their applications in drug discovery, linker chemistry, and materials sciences. In this study, a new shelf&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare bilateral disulfurating platform molecule, N&#8208;(morpholine&#8208;4&#8208;dithio)phthalimide, has been developed for the divergent synthesis of unsymmetrical disulfides. The amino and imide leaving groups of this reagent can be orthogonally transformed. Under acidic conditions, the amino moiety undergoes selective protonation and thus can be displaced by various carbon nucleophiles, such as allyl trimethylsilanes, alkynyl silanes, and electron&#8208;rich arenes, leaving the phthalimide moiety untouched. Meanwhile, the phthalimide leaving group is amenable to substitution under basic or neutral conditions. The combination of these transformations provides rapid access to diverse unsymmetrical disulfides through two C&#8722;S bond&#8208;forming reactions.

         <title>Facile Synthesis and Chiral Resolution of Expanded Helicenes with up to 35 cata&#8208;Fused Benzene Rings
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanded helicenes with up to 35 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings can be synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;coupling&#8208;mediated oligomerization followed by bismuth(III)&#8208;triflate&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of vinyl ethers. Their chiroptical properties were also studied.







Abstract
Expanded helicenes are expected to show enhanced chiroptical properties as compared to the classical helicenes but the synthesis is very challenging. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a series of expanded helicenes Hn (n=1&#8211;4) containing 11, 19, 27 and 35 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings through Suzuki coupling&#8208;based oligomerization followed by Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated regioselective cyclization of vinyl ethers. Their structures were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Enantiopure H2, H3, and H4 can be isolated by chiral HPLC and they all exhibit strong chiroptical responses with high absorption dissymmetry factor (|gabs|) values (0.020 for H2, 0.021 for H3, and 0.021&#8211;0.024 for H4).

         <title>Modular Synthesis of a Tridecasaccharide Motif of Bacteroides vulgatus Lipopolysaccharides against Inflammatory Bowel Diseases through an Orthogonal One&#8208;Pot Glycosylation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tridecasaccharide from Bacteroides vulgatus mpk lipopolysaccharides has been synthesized for the first time by a strategy involving orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation reactions based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which precluded issues such as aglycone transfer and the unpleasant odor of thioglycoside&#8208;based orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation.







Abstract
Lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides vulgatus represent interesting targets for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. However, efficient access to long, branched and complex lipopolysaccharides remains challenging. Herein, we report the modular synthesis of a tridecasaccharide from Bacteroides vulgates through an orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which avoids the issues of thioglycoside&#8208;based one&#8208;pot synthesis. Our approach also features: 1) 5,7&#8208;O&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene&#8208;directed glycosylation for stereoselective construction of the &#945;&#8208;Kdo linkage; 2) hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery for the stereoselective formation of &#946;&#8208;mannosidic bonds; 3) remote anchimeric assistance for stereoselective assembly of the &#945;&#8208;fucosyl linkage; 4) several orthogonal one&#8208;pot synthetic steps and strategic use of orthogonal protecting groups to streamline oligosaccharide assembly; 5) convergent [1+6+6] one&#8208;pot synthesis of the target.

         <title>An n&#8208;Type Polythiophene Derivative with Excellent Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring conjugated polymer is developed by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing imide or cyano groups to each thiophene unit of polythiophene backbone. The resultant polymer shows low LUMO/HOMO energy levels and highly ordered crystallite structure, leading to excellent thermoelectric performance after n&#8208;doping.







Abstract
Typical n&#8208;type conjugated polymers are based on fused&#8208;ring electron&#8208;accepting building blocks. Herein, we report a non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring strategy to design n&#8208;type conjugated polymers, i.e. introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing imide or cyano groups to each thiophene unit of a non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring polythiophene backbone. The resulting polymer, n&#8208;PT1, shows low LUMO/HOMO energy levels of &#8722;3.91&#8197;eV/&#8722;6.22&#8197;eV, high electron mobility of 0.39&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and high crystallinity in thin film. After n&#8208;doping, n&#8208;PT1 exhibits excellent thermoelectric performance with an electrical conductivity of 61.2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a power factor (PF) of 141.7&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. This PF is the highest value reported so far for n&#8208;type conjugated polymers and this is the first time for polythiophene derivatives to be used in n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics. The excellent thermoelectric performance of n&#8208;PT1 is due to its superior tolerance to doping. This work indicates that polythiophene derivatives without fused rings are low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymers.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responsive Luminescence and Domino Phase Transition of Hybrid Copper Halides with Nonlinear Optical Switching Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;stimuli responsive luminescent material has been developed that not only exhibits reversible photoluminescence conversion and nonlinear optical switching in response to thermal stimulus, but also observes peculiar crystal&#8208;phase&#8208;recognition induced domino&#8208;type single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transition and mechanical force induced phase transition under concomitant emission&#8208;color change.







Abstract
Although phase transition materials (PTMs) under external stimuli are of great research interest duo to their rich potential applications, it is still challenging to explore multi&#8208;responsive PTMs. Herein, two different phases of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid copper&#8208;based halides, &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Gua3Cu2I5 (Gua+=CN3H6+), were synthesized by solvent evaporation method, which they crystalize in the noncentrosymmetric space group Fdd2 with zero&#8208;dimensional structure and centrosymmetric space group C2/c with one&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halogen framework, respectively. Interestingly, it is firstly demonstrated that Gua3Cu2I5 simultaneously possesses reversible PL conversion and NLO switching properties in response to thermal stimulus. Strikingly, apart from heat, its structural phase transition can also be triggered by crystalline&#8208;phase&#8208;recognition (CPR) and mechanical force. These new findings may pave a path for future exploration of PTMs with multiple physical properties.

         <title>Cyclopentylmethyl Ether, a Non&#8208;Fluorinated, Weakly Solvating and Wide Temperature Solvent for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While recent work demonstrates the advantages of weakly solvating solvents in enhancing the cyclability of LMBs, both new designs and design strategies for high performance weakly solvating solvent, especially physicochemical properties, are still lacking. Here, we propose a molecular design to tune the solvating power and physicochemical properties of non&#8208;fluorinated ether solvent. The resulting cyclopentylmethyl ether (CPME) have a weak solvating power and wide liquid&#8208;phase temperature range. By optimizing the salt concentration, the CE is further promoted to 99.4%. Besides, the improved electrochemical performance of Li&#8211;S battery in CPME&#8208;based electrolytes is obtained at &#8722;20 &#176;C. The Li||LFP (17.6 mg cm&#8211;2) battery with developed electrolyte maintains &gt;90% of the original capacity over 400 cycles. Our design concept for solvent molecule provides a promising pathway to non&#8208;fluorinated electrolytes with weakly solvating power and wide temperature window for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A copper&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic diaryliodoniums, NaOCN and phenols was reported. The reaction chemoselectively afforded axially chiral carbamates by sequential coupling of cyclic diaryliodonium and NaOCN, followed by phenol. Mechanistic investigation revealed phenol is not only a reagent to trap highly active intermediate isocyanates, but activate the copper catalyst as a standby ligand. The carbamates were readily advanced to highly functionalized ureas within a simple nucleophilic substitution reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Utilizing Nitroarenes and HCHO to Directly Construct Functional N&#8208;Heterocycles by Supported Cobalt/Amino Acid Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the generation of multiple intermediates during the nitroarene reduction, precise interception of single one to develop tandem reactions involving both C&#8211;C and C&#8211;N bond formations still remains a significant challenge. Herein, the relay catalysis of a supported bifunctional cobalt catalyst with L&#8208;proline has been successfully applied to establish a bran&#8208;new reductive annulation reaction of nitroarenes and formaldehyde, which enables direct and diverse construction of both symmetrical and unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;diaryl imidazolines. It proceeds with operational simplicity, good substrate and functionality compatibility, and excellent step and atom&#8208;efficiency. Mechanistic studies reveal that the Co&#8208;catalyst exhibits a synergistic effect on the formation of key N&#8208;hydroxy imine, and the L&#8208;proline subsequently facilitates the key C&#8211;C bond formation. The current work opens a door to develop useful transformations with nitroarenes by reduction&#8208;interrupted strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimer Acceptor Adopting a Flexible Linker for Efficient and Durable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells (OSCs) have advanced rapidly due to the development of new photovoltaic materials. However, the long&#8208;term stability of OSCs still poses a severe challenge for their commercial deployment. To address this issue, a dimer acceptor (dT9TBO) with flexible linker is developed for incorporation into small&#8208;molecule acceptors to form molecular alloy with enhanced intermolecular packing and suppressed molecular diffusion to stabilize active layer morphology. Consequently, the PM6:Y6:dT9TBO&#8208;based device displays an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.41% with excellent thermal stability and negligible decay after being aged at 65 &#176;C for 1800 h. Moreover, the PM6:Y6:dT9TBO&#8208;based flexible OSC also exhibits excellent mechanical durability, maintaining 95% of its initial PCE after being bended repetitively for 1500 cycles. This work provides a simple and effective way to fine&#8208;tune the molecular packing with stabilized morphology to overcome the trade&#8208;off between OSC efficiency and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>A Direct Formaldehyde Fuel Cell for CO2&#8208;Emission Free Co&#8208;generation of Electrical Energy and Valuable Chemical/Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Challenges lie in converting carbon&#8208;based molecular fuels into electricity efficiently and cleanly without emitting CO2. Conventional fuel cells that use noble metals as anode catalysts often suffer performance degradation due to CO poisoning and a host of problems associated with CO2 production. This study provides a CO2&#8208;emission&#8208;free direct formaldehyde fuel cell. It enables a flow of electricity while producing H2 and valuable formate. Unlike conventional carbon&#8208;based molecules electrooxidation, formaldehyde 1&#8208;electron oxidation is performed on the Cu anode with high selectivity, thus generating formate and H2 without undergoing CO2 pathway. In addition, the fuel cell produces 0.62 Nm3 H2 and 53 mol formate per 1 kWh of electricity generated, with an open circuit voltage of up to 1 V and a peak power density of 350 mW/cm2. This study puts forward a zero&#8208;carbon solution for the efficient utilization of carbon&#8208;based molecule fuels that generates electricity, hydrogen and valuable chemicals in synchronization.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;CPL from chiral complexes of lanthanides and d&#8208;metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared circularly polarised luminescence (NIR&#8208;CPL) has many interesting and potential applications ranging from CPL&#8208;microscopy to the telecommunication industry. In recent years, a surge of visible&#8208;emissive CPL systems has occurred, due to the increased popularity of CPL as a spectroscopic technique and greater accessibility to CPL instrumentation. Despite the increased interest, few reports on complexes which emit in the NIR are available, and mostly limited to lanthanide and Cr(III) complexes due to their large pseudo&#8208;Stokes shift and magnetic dipole (MD) allowed, electric dipole (ED) forbidden nature. In the following, we aim to give an overview of the recent technological improvements, which allow NIR&#8208;CPL to be measured, and describe the chiroptical properties of metal complexes which achieve this feat.</dc:description>

         <title>Approaching theoretical performances of electrocatalytic hydrogen peroxide generation by cobalt&#8208;nitrogen moieties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been intensively studied for efficient and environmentally benign energy conversion processes. However, insufficient understanding of ORR 2e&#8208;&#8208;pathway mechanism at the atomic level inhibits rational design of electrocatalysts with both high activity and selectivity, causing concerns including catalyst degradation due to Fenton reaction or poor efficiency of H2O2 electrosynthesis. Herein we show that the generally accepted ORR electrocatalyst design based on a Sabatier volcano plot argument optimises activity but is unable to account for the 2e&#8208;&#8208;pathway selectivity; an extended &#8220;dynamic active site saturation&#8221; model that examines in addition the hydrogenation kinetics linked to the OOH* adsorption energy enables us to resolve the activity&#8208;selectivity compromise. Through electrochemical and operando spectroscopic studies on the ORR process governed by a series of Co&#8208;N x /carbon nanotube hybrids, a construction&#8208;driven approach that aims to create the maximum number of 2e&#8208; ORR sites by directing the secondary ORR electron transfer step towards the 2e&#8208; intermediate is proven to be attainable by manipulating O2 hydrogenation kinetics. Control experiments reveal the O2 hydrogenation chemistry is related to a catalyst reconstruction with lower symmetry around the Co active centre induced by the application of a cathodic potential. The optimised catalyst exhibits a ~100% H2O2 selectivity and an outstanding activity with an ORR potential of 0.82 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode to reach the ring current density of 1 mA cm&#8208;2 by using rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode measurement, which is the best&#8208;performing 2e&#8208; ORR electrocatalyst reported to date, and approaches the thermodynamic limit.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) of clinical biomarkers is critical to health monitoring and timely treatment, yet biosensing assays capable of detecting biomarkers without the need for costly external equipment and reagents are limited. Blood&#8208;based assays are, specifically, challenging as blood collection is invasive while pre&#8208;processing is required. Here, we report a versatile assay that employs hydrogel microneedles (HMNs) to extract interstitial fluid (ISF), in a minimally invasive manner integrated with graphene oxide&#8208;nucleic acid (GO.NA)&#8208;based fluorescence biosensor to sense the biomarkers of interest in situ. The HMN&#8208;GO.NA assay is supplemented with a portable detector, enabling a complete POCT procedure. Our system could successfully measure four clinically important biomarkers (glucose, uric acid (UA), insulin, and serotonin) ex&#8208;vivo, in addition, to accurately detecting glucose and UA in&#8208;vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic pH Buffer for Dendrite&#8208;Free and Shuttle&#8208;Free Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;iodine (I2) batteries are attractive for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, drawbacks include, Zn dendrites, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), corrosion and, cathode &#8216;shuttle&#8217; of polyiodines. Here we report a class of N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds as organic pH buffers to obviate these. We evidence that addition of pyridine /imidazole regulates electrolyte pH, and inhibits HER and anode corrosion. In addition, pyridine and imidazole preferentially absorb on Zn metal, regulating non&#8208;dendritic Zn plating /stripping, and achieving a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% and long&#8208;term cycling stability of 3,200 h at 2 mA cm&#8208;2, 2 mAh cm&#8208;2. It is also confirmed that pyridine inhibits polyiodines shuttling and boosts conversion kinetics for I&#8208;/I2. As a result, the Zn&#8208;I2 full battery exhibits long cycle stability of &gt; 25,000 cycles and high specific capacity of 105.5 mAh g&#8208;1 at 10 A g&#8208;1. We conclude organic pH buffer engineering is practical for dendrite&#8208;free and shuttle&#8208;free Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Approach for Air&#8208;Tolerant and Extremely Fast Lithium&#8208;Based Birch Reductions in Minutes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birch reduction has been widely used in organic synthesis for over half a century as a powerful method to dearomatize arenes into 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene derivatives. However, the conventional Birch reduction reaction using liquid ammonia requires laborious procedures to ensure inert conditions and low temperatures. Although several ammonia&#8208;free modifications have been reported, the development of an operationally simple, efficient, and scalable protocol remains a challenge. Herein, we report an ammonia&#8208;free lithium&#8208;based Birch reduction in air at room temperature without special operating conditions using a ball&#8208;milling technique. This method is characterized by its operational simplicity and an extremely short reaction time (within 1 min), probably owing to the in&#8208;situ mechanical activation of lithium metal,&#160;broad substrate scope, and no requirement for dry bulk solvents. The potential of our flash Birch reaction is also demonstrated by the efficient reduction of bioactive target molecules and gram&#8208;scale synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoupling Redox Hopping and Catalysis in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks &#8208;based Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional MOF e&#8208;CRR, constructed from catalytic linkers, manifest a kinetic bottleneck during their multi&#8208;electron activation. Decoupling catalysis and charge transport can address such issues. Here, we build two MOF/e&#8208;CRR systems, CoPc@NU&#8208;1000 and TPP(Co)@NU&#8208;1000, by installing cobalt metalated phthalocyanine and tetraphenylporphyrin electrocatalysts within the redox active NU&#8208;1000 MOF. For CoPc@NU&#8208;1000, the e&#8208;CRR responsive CoI/0 potential is close to that of NU&#8208;1000 reduction compared to the TPP(Co)@NU&#8208;1000. Efficient charge delivery, defined by a higher diffusion (Dhop =4.1&#215;10&#8208;12 cm2 s&#8254;1) and low charge&#8208;transport resistance ( = 59.5 &#937;) in CoPC@NU&#8208;1000 led FECO = 80%. In contrast, TPP(Co)@NU&#8208;1000 fared a poor FECO = 24% (Dhop = 1.4&#215;10&#8208;12 cm2 s&#8254;1 and = 91.4 &#937;). For such a decoupling strategy, careful choice of the host framework is critical in pairing up with the underlying electrochemical properties of the catalysts to facilitate the charge delivery for its activation.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traditional MOF e-CRR, constructed from catalytic linkers, manifest a kinetic bottleneck during their multi-electron activation. Decoupling catalysis and charge transport can address such issues.

         <title>C&#8208;H Functionalization and Allylic Amination for Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification of Polynorbornenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM) via direct C&#8208;H functionalization is a powerful synthetic strategy to convert polymer feed&#8208;stocks into value&#8208;added products. We found that a metal&#8208;free, Se&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8208;H amination provided an efficient method for PPM of polynorbornenes (PNBs) produced via ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization. Inherent to the mechanism of the allylic amination, PPM on PNBs preserved the alkene functional groups along the polymer backbone, while also avoiding transposition of the double bonds. Amination using a series of aryl sulfonamides led to good control over the degree of functionalization, access to a range of functionalities, and tunable thermal properties from the resulting polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Singlet Oxygen Induced Site&#8208;Specific Etching Boosts Nitrogen&#8208;Carbon Sites for High&#8208;Efficiency Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted construction of carbon defects near the N dopants is an intriguing but challenging way to boost the electrocatalytic activity of N&#8208;doped carbon toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report a novel site&#8208;specific etching strategy that features targeted anchoring of singlet oxygen (1O2) on the N&#8208;adjacent atoms to directionally construct topological carbon defects neighboring the N dopants in N&#8208;doped carbon (1O2&#8208;N/C). This 1O2&#8208;N/C exhibits the highest ORR half&#8208;wave potential of 0.915 VRHE among all the reported metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts. Pyridinic&#8208;N bonded with a carbon pentagon of the neighboring topological carbon defects is identified as the primary active configuration, rendering enhanced adsorption of O2, optimized adsorption energy of the ORR intermediates, and a significantly decreased total energy barrier for ORR. This 1O2&#8208;induced site&#8208;specific etching strategy is also applicable to different precursors, showing a tremendous potential for targeted construction of high&#8208;efficiency active sites in carbon&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly&#8208;Efficient Ion Gating through Self&#8208;Assembled Two&#8208;Dimensional Photothermal Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological ion channels regulate the ion flow across cell membrane via opening or closing of the pores in response to various external stimuli. Replicating the function of high ion gating effects with artificial porous materials has been challenging. Herein, we report that the self&#8208;assembled two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membrane can serve as an excellent nanofluidic platform for smart regulation of ion transport. The MOF membrane with good photothermal performance exhibits extremely high ion gating ratio (up to 104), which is among the highest values in MOF membrane nanochannels for light&#8208;controlled ion gating reported so far. By repeatedly turning on and off the light, the nanofluidic device shows outstanding stability and reversibility that can be applied in the remote light&#8208;switching system. This work may spark promising applications of MOF membrane with variety of stimuli responsive properties in ion sieving, biosensing, and energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Catalytic Asymmetric and Regiodivergent N1&#8208; and C3&#8208; Allenylic Alkylation of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allenylic alkylation strategy for the direct functionalization of 1H&#8208;indoles by employing P&#8208;chiral BIBOP&#8208;type ligands. The regioselectivity (N1/C3) of this process can be switched efficiently. Using Cs2CO3 at elevated temperatures in MeCN, N1&#8208;alkylated indoles bearing axial chirality with a stereocenter non&#8208;adjacent (&#946;) to the nitrogen are produced in good yields with high enantioselectivity and complete N1&#8208;regioselectivity regardless of the electronic properties and substitution patterns of diverse indoles. Using K2CO3 at room temperature in DCM, chiral C3&#8208;alkylated indoles can be obtained as well. Notably, we introduce a new class of tri&#8208;substituted allenylic electrophiles that proceeded through different pathways from di&#8208;substituted allenylic electrophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Nanographenes with Joined Nonhexagons via a Ring Expansion Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic methodology is considered a holy grail in both organic chemistry and materials science. Over the past few decades, researchers have explored graphene&#8208;type molecules (or nanographenes) through classic Scholl oxidative cyclodehydrogenation. Despite the successes achieved with various nanographenes, the development of new methods to synthesize these highly desired molecules lags behind. Herein, we developed a facile and effective method to produce a series of nanographenes bearing nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs in acceptable yields. Modification of the heptagonal ring endowed the resultant nanographenes with tunable physicochemical properties; for instance, M9 exhibited both aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior. Most strikingly, novel nanographenes containing N&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;octagon pairs were also obtained using the same synthetic strategy, demonstrating the superior versatility and efficiency of the proposed ring expansion method.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Supramolecular Polymers Based on Selectively Recognized Aromatic Cation&#8211;&#960; and Donor&#8211;Acceptor Motifs for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic polymers have recently received considerable interest, especially those whose architectures are held together via supramolecular engineering. However, current approaches toward supramolecular 2D structures usually suffer from mutual interference of noncovalent interactions and lack of intrinsic functions. Herein, we report well&#8208;regulated 2D supramolecular polymers (2DSPs) through an aromatics&#8208;selective recognition strategy of cation&#8211;&#960; and donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) motifs, which are derived from C4&#8208;symmetric cationic monomers and electron&#8208;withdrawing molecules. By subtly designing the strength and direction of noncovalent driving forces, the mutual interference between cation&#8211;&#960; and D&#8211;A interactions is effectively avoided, enabling the construction of 2DSPs in aqueous solution. On this basis, the resultant 2DSPs possess boosted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity at a rate of 600 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, which is mainly ascribed to the specific stacking mode of cation&#8211;&#960;/D&#8211;A motifs and the ordered 2D structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating Lattice Oxygen in Spinel ZnCo2O4 through Filling the Oxygen Vacancies with Fluorine for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of productive catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a major challenge that requires significant progress in both mechanism and material design. Conventionally, the thermodynamic barrier of the lattice oxidation mechanism (LOM) is lower than that of absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) because the former could bypass certain limitations. However, it remains a challenging task to control the OER pathway from the AEM to the LOM by taking advantage of the intrinsic properties of catalyst. Herein, we incorporate F anion into oxygen vacancies of spinel ZnCo2O4 and establish the link between electronic structure and the OER catalytic mechanism. Density theoretical calculation reveals that F upshifts O 2p center and activate the redox capability of the lattice O, successfully triggering the LOM pathway, achieving a low overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, the large electronegativity of F anion is favorable for the balance of residual protonation, which can stabilize the structure and locally trigger LOM without surface reconstruction during OER reaction. This finding provides a feasible strategy to concurrently enhance the activity and stability of OER, and demonstrates the significance of considering lattice oxygen participation for understanding the OER trend of highly active spinel.</dc:description>

         <title>Complete Depolymerization of PET Wastes by an Evolved PET Hydrolase from Directed Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iterative rounds of directed evolution of PETase were performed employing a novel high&#8208;throughput fluorescence screening assay with a newly designed substrate BHET&#8208;OH. The generated DepoPETase enabled complete depolymerization of untreated PET wastes at mild temperature. The identified substitutions stabilized the loops around the active sites and transmitted the stabilization effect to the active sites through enhancing inter&#8208;loop interactions network.







Abstract
PETase displays great potential in PET depolymerization. Directed evolution has been limited to engineer PETase due to the lack of high&#8208;throughput screening assay. In this study, a novel fluorescence&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screening assay employing a newly designed substrate, bis (2&#8208;hydroxyethyl) 2&#8208;hydroxyterephthalate (termed BHET&#8208;OH), was developed for PET hydrolases. The best variant DepoPETase produced 1407&#8208;fold more products towards amorphous PET film at 50&#8201;&#176;C and showed a 23.3&#8201;&#176;C higher Tm value than the PETase WT. DepoPETase enabled complete depolymerization of seven untreated PET wastes and 19.1&#8197;g PET waste (0.4&#8201;% Wenzyme/WPET) in liter&#8208;scale reactor, suggesting that it is a potential candidate for industrial PET depolymerization processes. The molecular dynamic simulations revealed that the distal substitutions stabilized the loops around the active sites and transmitted the stabilization effect to the active sites through enhancing inter&#8208;loop interactions network.

         <title>Stable Crystalline Nanohoop Radical and Its Self&#8208;Association Promoted by van der Waals Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable nanohoop radical combining an olympicenyl radical and cycloparaphenylene structures has been synthesized. Unlike other olympicenyl radicals that favor &#960;&#8208;dimerization, this nanohoop radical dimerizes and aggregates by virtue of van der Waals interaction in the solid state.







Abstract
A stable nanohoop radical (OR3) combining the structures of cycloparaphenylene and an olympicenyl radical is synthesized and isolated in the crystalline state. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals that OR3 forms a unique head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimer that further aggregates into a one&#8208;dimensional chain in the solid state. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR and concentration&#8208;dependent absorption measurements indicate that the &#960;&#8208;dimer is not formed in solution. An energy decomposition analysis indicates that van der Waals interactions are the driving force for the self&#8208;association process, in contrast with other olympicenyl derivatives that favor &#960;&#8208;dimerization. The physical properties in solution phase have been studied, and the stable cationic species obtained by one&#8208;electron chemical oxidation. This study offers a new molecular design to modulate the self&#8208;association of organic radicals for overcoming the spin&#8208;Peierls transition, and to prepare novel nanohoop compounds with spin&#8208;related properties.

         <title>Reversible Single Electron Redox Steps Convert Polycycles with a C3P3 Core to a Planar Triphosphinine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of the biradicaloid IDP with trityl phosphaalkyne affords polycyclic compounds with a formally dianionic C3P3 core, which are in a dynamic equilibrium. The reversible, stepwise oxidation by two electrons leads to a planar triphosphinine with an aromatic 6&#960;&#8208;electron system. A monocyclic 7&#960;&#8208;electron radical cation could be isolated as intermediate.







Abstract
Reaction of the imidazolium&#8208;stabilized diphosphete&#8208;diide IDP with trityl phosphaalkyne affords a mixture which contains the molecules 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b with a central C3P3 core, which formally carries a two&#8208;fold negative charge. In order to avoid the formation of an antiaromatic 8&#960; electron system within a conjugated dianionic six&#8208;membered [C3P3]2&#8722; ring, 1&#8201;a adopts a bicyclic [3.1.0] and 1&#8201;b a tricyclic [2.2.0.0] structure which are in a dynamic equilibrium. 1&#8201;a,&#8201;b can be reversibly oxidized to a triphosphinine dication [5]2+ with a central flat aromatic six&#8208;membered C3P3 ring. This two&#8208;electron redox reaction occurs in two single&#8208;electron transfer steps via the 7&#960;&#8208;radical cation [4]&#8901;+, which could also be isolated and fully characterized. The profound reversible structural change observed for the two&#8208;electron redox couple [5]2+/1&#8201;a,&#8201;b is in sharp contrast to the C6H6/[C6H6]2&#8722; couple, which undergoes only a modest structural deformation.

         <title>Supramolecular Capsule Catalysis Enables the Exploration of Terpenoid Chemical Space Untapped by Nature</title>

         <dc:description>
The chemical space of terpene natural products can be increased dramatically by expanding the highly conserved substrate scope. Such an expansion based on C3&#8208;phenyl, benzyl, and homoprenyl derivatives of farnesol provided access to novel skeletons related to the presilphiperfolane core structure, as well as novel neoclovene derivatives.







Abstract
Terpenes represent the largest and the most diverse class of natural compounds. This is remarkable as the whole variety is accessed from just a handful of highly conserved linear precursors. Modification of the cyclization precursors would enable a dramatic expansion of the accessible chemical space. However, natural enzymes do not enable us to tap into this potential, as they do not tolerate larger deviations from the prototypical substrate structure. Herein we report that supramolecular capsule catalysis enables facile access to diverse and novel terpenoid skeletons that formally can be traced back to C3&#8208;phenyl, benzyl, and homoprenyl derivatives of farnesol. Novel skeletons related to the presilphiperfolane core structure, as well as novel neoclovene derivatives were accessed efficiently in only four synthetic steps. Importantly, the products obtained carry functional groups that may be readily derivatized further.

The efficient conversion of &#8220;non&#8208;polymerizable&#8221; &#947;&#8208;valerolactone and its derivatives is presented. The abundant but unexploited renewable feedstocks give new sustainable polythioesters with tunable materials properties through the establishment of the first isomerization&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerizations of corresponding thionolactone intermediates via the development of a new simple and robust [Et3O]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; cationic initiator.







Abstract
This contribution reports the efficient conversion of &#947;&#8208;valerolactone and its derivatives, abundant but unexplored renewable feedstocks, into sustainable and degradable polythioesters via the establishment of the first isomerization&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerizations (IROPs) of corresponding thionolactone intermediates. The key to this success relies on the development of a new simple and robust [Et3O]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; cationic initiator which possesses high activity, exclusive selectivity, living nature, and broad scope of thionolactones. A complete inversion of configuration during IROP of enantiopure &#947;&#8208;thionovalerolactone is also disclosed, affording isotactic semicrystalline polythioesters (Tm=87.0&#8201;&#176;C) with mechanical property compared well to the representative commodity polyolefins. The formation of a highly crystalline supramolecular stereocomplex with enhanced thermal property (Tm=117.6&#8201;&#176;C) has also been revealed.

         <title>A Covalent Organic Framework as a Long&#8208;life and High&#8208;Rate Anode Suitable for Both Aqueous Acidic and Alkaline Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepared a covalent organic framework containing pyrazine (C=N) and phenylimino (&#8722;NH&#8722;) groups (HPP&#8208;COF) as an anode. The robust covalent linkage and the hydrogen bond network between &#8722;NH&#8722; and H2O collectively improve the acid&#8208;alkaline co&#8208;tolerance and promote the rapid conduction of H+/OH&#8722; by the Grotthuss mechanism. Thus the HPP&#8208;COF exhibits superior cycle stability and rate performance in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes.







Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable batteries are prospective candidates for large&#8208;scale grid energy storage. However, traditional anode materials applied lack acid&#8208;alkali co&#8208;tolerance. Herein, we report a covalent organic framework containing pyrazine (C=N) and phenylimino (&#8722;NH&#8722;) groups (HPP&#8208;COF) as a long&#8208;cycle and high&#8208;rate anode for both acidic and alkaline batteries. The HPP&#8208;COF&#8242;s robust covalent linkage and the hydrogen bond network between &#8722;NH&#8722; and water molecules collectively improve the acid&#8208;alkaline co&#8208;tolerance. More importantly, the hydrogen bond network promotes the rapid transport of H+/OH&#8722; by the Grotthuss mechanism. As a result, the HPP&#8208;COF delivers a superior capacity and cycle stability (66.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1@ 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, over 40000 cycles in 1&#8197;M H2SO4 electrolyte; 91.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1@ 100&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, over 30000 cycles @ 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M NaOH electrolyte). The work opens a new direction for the structural design and application of COF materials in acidic and alkaline batteries.

         <title>Electrophilically Trapping Water for Preventing Polymerization of Cyclic Ether Towards Low&#8208;Temperature Li Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ring&#8208;opening polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) initiated by protons is inhibited by eliminating the trace water in the electrolyte through a water scavenger, which ensures promising low&#8208;temperature performances for LiCoO2 cathode. These findings demonstrate the high feasibility of water scavenger for unexplored design of cyclic ether based low&#8208;temperature electrolytes.







Abstract
Cyclic ether, such as 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL), are promising solvent for low&#8208;temperature electrolytes because of the low freezing point. Their use in electrolytes, however, is severely limited since it easily polymerizes in the presence of lithium inorganic salts. The trace water plays a key role via providing the source (proton) for chain initiation, which has, unfortunately, been neglected in most cases. In this work, we present an electrophile, trimethylsilyl isocyanate (Si&#8722;NCO), as the water scavenger, which eliminates moisture by a nucleophilic addition reaction. Si&#8722;NCO allows DOL to maintain liquid over a wide temperature range even in high&#8208;concentration electrolyte. Electrolyte with Si&#8722;NCO additive shows promising low&#8208;temperature performance. Our finding expands the use of cyclic ether solvents in the presence of inorganic salts and highlights a large space for unexplored design of water scavenger with electrophilic feature for low&#8208;temperature electrolytes.

         <title>Solvent Induced Conversion of a Self&#8208;Assembled Gyrobifastigium to a Barrel and Encapsulation of Zinc&#8208;Phthalocyanine within the Barrel for Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare gyrobifastigium structure was constructed and converted to its isomeric Pd8 tetragonal barrel by simple treatment with water. The water&#8208;soluble barrel was used as a host to encapsulate hydrophobic photosensitizer zinc&#8208;phthalocyanine (ZnPc) for enhanced PDT activity in the aqueous medium under red light irradiation.







Abstract
A rare gyrobifastigium architecture (GB) was constructed by self&#8208;assembly of a tetradentate donor (L) with PdII acceptor in DMSO. The GB was converted to its isomeric tetragonal barrel (MB) upon treatment with water. The hydrophobic cavity of MB has been explored for the encapsulation of zinc&#8208;phthalocyanine (ZnPc), which is an excellent photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, the poor water&#8208;solubility and aggregation tendency are the main reasons for the suboptimal PDT performance of free ZnPc in the aqueous medium. Effective solubilization of ZnPc in an aqueous medium was achieved by encapsulating it in the cavity of MB. The inclusion complex (ZnPc&#8834;MB) showed enhanced singlet oxygen generation in water. Higher cellular uptake and anticancer activity of the ZnPc&#8834;MB compared to free ZnPc on HeLa cells indicate that encapsulation of ZnPc in an aqueous host is a potential strategy for enhancement of its PDT activity in water.

         <title>An Isotope&#8208;Labeled Single&#8208;Cell Raman Spectroscopy Approach for Tracking the Physiological Evolution Trajectory of Bacteria toward Antibiotic Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;cell approach integrating D2O&#8208;labeled Raman spectroscopy, advanced multivariate analysis and genotypic profiling was developed to in situ track the highly heterogeneous and dynamic physiological evolution trajectory of bacteria toward antibiotic resistance. The physiological diversification of single cells into four subpopulations preceding resistance from an isogeneic population was sensitively captured and their dynamic shift was tracked.







Abstract
Understanding evolution of antibiotic resistance is vital for containing its global spread. Yet our ability to in situ track highly heterogeneous and dynamic evolution is very limited. Here, we present a new single&#8208;cell approach integrating D2O&#8208;labeled Raman spectroscopy, advanced multivariate analysis, and genotypic profiling to in situ track physiological evolution trajectory toward resistance. Physiological diversification of individual cells from isogenic population with cyclic ampicillin treatment is captured. Advanced multivariate analysis of spectral changes classifies all individual cells into four subsets of sensitive, intrinsic tolerant, evolved tolerant and resistant. Remarkably, their dynamic shifts with evolution are depicted and spectral markers of each state are identified. Genotypic analysis validates the phenotypic shift and provides insights into the underlying genetic basis. The new platform advances rapid phenotyping resistance evolution and guides evolution control.

         <title>Enzymatic Electrosynthesis of Glycine from CO2 and NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic electrocatalytic system was developed for the simultaneous conversion of CO2 and NH3 for glycine synthesis. This system was inspired by the reductive glycine pathway in vivo and involves an in vitro multienzymatic cascade reaction. It shows the potential of enzymatic CO2 electroreduction for the synthesis of nitrogenous value&#8208;added chemicals.







Abstract
Enzymatic electrosynthesis has gained more and more interest as an emerging green synthesis platform, particularly for the fixation of CO2. However, the simultaneous utilization of CO2 and a nitrogenous molecule for the enzymatic electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added products has never been reported. In this study, we constructed an in vitro multienzymatic cascade based on the reductive glycine pathway and demonstrated an enzymatic electrocatalytic system that allowed the simultaneous conversion of CO2 and NH3 as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources to synthesize glycine. Through effective coupling and the optimization of electrochemical cofactor regeneration and the multienzymatic cascade reaction, 0.81&#8197;mM glycine was yielded with a highest reaction rate of 8.69&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and faradaic efficiency of 96.8&#8201;%. These results imply a promising alternative for enzymatic CO2 electroreduction and expand its products to nitrogenous chemicals.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Controlled Quadruple Catenation of Giant Chiral [8+12] Salicylimine Cubes Driven by Weak Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quadruply interlocked catenane has been formed from giant chiral [8+12] salicylimine cubes in a reaction that can be controlled by the reaction solvent. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed hydrogen bonding to be a central driving force for the catenation. Furthermore, scrambling experiments with partially deuterated cages allowed mechanistic insights into the interlocking process.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked structures are fascinating synthetic targets and the topological complexity achieved through catenation offers numerous possibilities for the construction of new molecules with exciting properties. In the structural space of catenated organic cage molecules, only few examples have been realized so far, and control over the catenation process in solution is still barely achieved. Herein, we describe the formation of a quadruply interlocked catenane of giant chiral [8+12] salicylimine cubes. The formation could be controlled by the choice of solvent used in the reaction. The interlocked structure was unambiguously characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and weak hydrogen bonding was identified as a central driving force for the catenation. Furthermore, scrambling experiments using partially deuterated cages were performed, revealing that the catenane formation occurs through mechanical interlocking of preformed single cages.

         <title>Ester Reduction with H2 on Bifunctional Metal&#8208;Acid Catalysts: Implications of Metal Identity on Rates and Selectivities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabling sustainable and continuous processes for ether production from bioderived esters on bifunctional solid catalysts: esters hydrogenate to hemiacetals on Pd, Rh, and Pt nanoparticles and diffuse to nearby Br&#248;nsted acids sites to form ethers or alcohols. Ester reduction rates are determined by H* addition to the C=O bond on metal sites and cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds on acid sites.







Abstract
Esters reduce to form ethers and alcohols on contact with metal nanoparticles supported on Br&#248;nsted acidic faujasite (M&#8208;FAU) that cleave C&#8722;O bonds by hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis pathways. Rates and selectivities for each pathway depend on the metal identity (M=Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Pt). Pt&#8208;FAU gives propyl acetate consumption rates up to 100 times greater than other M&#8208;FAU catalysts and provides an ethyl propyl ether selectivity of 34&#8201;%. Measured formation rates, kinetic isotope effects, and site titrations suggest that ester reduction involves a bifunctional mechanism that implicates the stepwise addition of H* atoms to the carbonyl to form hemiacetals on the metal sites, followed by hemiacetal diffusion to a nearby Br&#248;nsted acid site to dehydrate to ethers or decompose to alcohol and aldehyde. The rates of reduction of propyl acetate appear to be determined by the H* addition to the carbonyl and by the C&#8722;O cleavage of hemiacetal.

         <title>Modular Metal&#8208;Quinone Networks with Tunable Architecture and Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of tubes, particles, capsules, and thin films has been developed using the modular coordination&#8208;driven assembly of metal&#8208;quinone networks (MQNs). The MQNs show versatile adhesion to diverse substrates and bidirectional pH&#8208;responsive disassembly with ligand&#8208;mediated kinetics. The incorporated medicinal properties of quinones enable their potential use as prodrugs in specific areas (e.g., cancer and Mpro inhibition in coronaviruses).







Abstract
Nanostructured materials with tunable structures and functionality are of interest in diverse areas. Herein, metal ions are coordinated with quinones through metal&#8208;acetylacetone coordination bonds to generate a class of structurally tunable, universally adhesive, hydrophilic, and pH&#8208;degradable materials. A library of metal&#8208;quinone networks (MQNs) is produced from five model quinone ligands paired with nine metal ions, leading to the assembly of particles, tubes, capsules, and films. Importantly, MQNs show bidirectional pH&#8208;responsive disassembly in acidic and alkaline solutions, where the quinone ligands mediate the disassembly kinetics, enabling temporal and spatial control over the release of multiple components using multilayered MQNs. Leveraging this tunable release and the inherent medicinal properties of quinones, MQN prodrugs with a high drug loading (&gt;89&#8197;wt&#8201;%) are engineered using doxorubicin for anti&#8208;cancer therapy and shikonin for the inhibition of the main protease in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus.

         <title>Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 and [Sr3Se2][(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2] Tunable Direct Band Gap Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile route using a two&#8208;component flux of LiOH/LiCl enables synthesis of new direct band gap semiconductors of the Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 series. Precise control of synthetic variables such as temperature and LiOH/LiCl ratio allows the fine&#8208;tuning of the Li substitution (x). This gives direct correlation between material properties and synthesis parameters, as the band gap increases with increasing x.







Abstract
Synthesizing solids in molten fluxes enables the rapid diffusion of soluble species at temperatures lower than in solid&#8208;state reactions, leading to crystal formation of kinetically stable compounds. In this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of mixed hydroxide and halide fluxes in synthesizing complex Sr/Ag/Se in mixed LiOH/LiCl. We have accessed a series of two&#8208;dimensional Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 layered phases. With increased LiOH/LiCl ratio or reaction temperature, Li partially substituted Ag to form solid solutions of Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 with x up to 0.45. In addition, a new type of intergrowth compound [Sr3Se2][(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2] was synthesized upon further reaction of Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 with SrSe. Both Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 and [Sr3Se2][(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2] exhibit a direct band gap, which increases with increasing Li substitution (x). Therefore, the band gap of Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 can be precisely tuned via fine&#8208;tuning x that is controlled by only the flux ratio and temperature.

         <title>Probing a Hydrogen&#8208;&#960; Interaction Involving a Trapped Water Molecule in the Solid State</title>

Solid&#8208;state NMR at fast magic&#8208;angle spinning (100&#8197;kHz) and high static magnetic field (28.2&#8197;T) has been employed in combination with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations to study a trapped water molecule in the cavity of a calix[4]arene lanthanide complex. The study illustrates the high sensitivity of proton NMR chemical&#8208;shift values for non&#8208;covalent interactions driving a whole branch of molecular&#8208;recognition events.







Abstract
The detection and characterization of trapped water molecules in chemical entities and biomacromolecules remains a challenging task for solid materials. We herein present proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments at 100&#8197;kHz magic&#8208;angle spinning and at high static magnetic&#8208;field strengths (28.2&#8197;T) enabling the detection of a single water molecule fixed in the calix[4]arene cavity of a lanthanide complex by a combination of three types of non&#8208;covalent interactions. The water proton resonances are detected at a chemical&#8208;shift value close to zero ppm, which we further confirm by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Density Functional Theory calculations pinpoint to the sensitivity of the proton chemical&#8208;shift value for hydrogen&#8208;&#960; interactions. Our study highlights how proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR is turning into the method&#8208;of&#8208;choice in probing weak non&#8208;covalent interactions driving a whole branch of molecular&#8208;recognition events in chemistry and biology.

         <title>CO2 Aggregation on Monoethanolamine: Observations from Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
How does CO2 interact with an alkanolamine in the gas phase? Using rotational spectroscopy, non&#8208;reactive complexes monoethanolamine&#8208;(CO2)n (where n=1&#8211;4) were characterized. It was discovered that CO2 has a binding priority to the hydroxyl group over the amine group. This is in sharp contrast to the general results observed in the solution phase.







Abstract
The initial stages of the gas&#8208;phase nucleation between CO2 and monoethanolamine were investigated via broadband rotational spectroscopy with the aid of extensive theoretical structure sampling. Sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;scale aggregation patterns of monoethanolamine&#8208;(CO2)n, n=1&#8211;4, were identified. An interesting competition between the monoethanolamine intramolecular hydrogen bond and the intermolecular interactions between monoethanolamine and CO2 upon cluster growth was discovered, revealing an intriguing CO2 binding priority to the hydroxyl group over the amine group. These findings are in sharp contrast to the general results for aqueous solutions. In the quinary complex, a cap&#8208;like CO2 tetramer was observed cooperatively surrounding the monoethanolamine. As the cluster approaches the critical size of new particle formation, the contribution of CO2 self&#8208;assembly to the overall stability increases.

         <title>The Directional Crystallization Process of Poly (triazine imide) Single Crystals in Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uncovers the molecular conjugation and directional precipitation processes of poly (triazine imide) single crystals in molten salts from mesoscopic to nanoscale. Controllable regulation of the dispersity of PTI crystals was achieved towards enhanced photocatalytic performance by manipulating the PTI/salt crystallization fronts.







Abstract
Poly (triazine imide) photocatalysts prepared via molten salt methods emerge as promising polymer semiconductors with one&#8208;step excitation capacity of overall water splitting. Unveiling the molecular conjugation, nucleation, and crystallization processes of PTI crystals is crucial for their controllable structure design. Herein, microscopy characterization was conducted at the PTI crystallization front from meso to nano scales. The heptazine&#8208;based precursor was found to depolymerize to triazine monomers within molten salts and KCl cubes precipitate as the leading cores that guide the directional stacking of PTI molecular units to form aggregated crystals. Upon this discovery, PTI crystals with improved dispersibility and enhanced photocatalytic performance were obtained by tailoring the crystallization fronts. This study advances insights into the directional assembling of PTI monomers on salt templates, placing a theoretical foundation for the ordered condensation of polymer crystals.

K+ ions are introduced as an electrolyte additive to achieve electrostatic shielding on &#956;&#8208;Sn, thereby achieving uniform sodiation and enhanced electrode stability.







Abstract
The applications of alloy&#8208;type anode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries are always obstructed by enormous volume variation upon cycles. Here, K+ ions are introduced as an electrolyte additive to improve the electrochemical performance via electrostatic shielding, using Sn microparticles (&#956;&#8208;Sn) as a model. Theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that K+ ions are not incorporated in the electrode, but accumulate on some sites. This accumulation slows down the local sodiation at the &#8220;hot spots&#8221;, promotes the uniform sodiation and enhances the electrode stability. Therefore, the electrode maintains a high specific capacity of 565&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 3000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, much better than the case without K+. The electrode also remains an areal capacity of &#8776;3.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 100 cycles. This method does not involve time&#8208;consuming preparation, sophisticated instruments and expensive reagents, exhibiting the promising potential for other anode materials.

         <title>Tailorable and Biocompatible Supramolecular&#8208;Based Hydrogels Featuring two Dynamic Covalent Chemistries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>

Here we report functionalized peptides that can participate in disulfide and acyl&#8208;hydrazone chemistry. DCLs of such molecules yield self&#8208;assembling fibres. We incorporated cell adhesion&#8208;promoting sequences into the scaffold that can undergo hydrogelation to obtain materials that present biologically relevant ligands. The importance of this work lies in the methodology for fabricating tailor&#8208;made materials through a modular approach.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) has proven to be a valuable tool in creating fascinating molecules, structures, and emergent properties in fully synthetic systems. Here we report a system that uses two dynamic covalent bonds in tandem, namely disulfides and hydrazones, for the formation of hydrogels containing biologically relevant ligands. The reversibility of disulfide bonds allows fiber formation upon oxidation of dithiol&#8208;peptide building block, while the reaction between NH&#8722;NH2 functionalized C&#8208;terminus and aldehyde cross&#8208;linkers results in a gel. The same bond&#8208;forming reaction was exploited for the &#8220;decoration&#8221; of the supramolecular assemblies by cell&#8208;adhesion&#8208;promoting sequences (RGD and LDV). Fast triggered gelation, cytocompatibility and ability to &#8220;on&#8208;demand&#8221; chemically customize fibrillar scaffold offer potential for applying these systems as a bioactive platform for cell culture and tissue engineering.

         <title>Programming Super DNA&#8208;Enzyme Molecules for On&#8208;Demand Enzyme Activity Modulation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme cascades in the free state are random and uncontrolled. We constructed a super DNA&#8208;enzymes molecule (SDEM) to make programmable and controlled cascades by toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement. The SDEMs can be made sensitive to different substrates on demand via an entropically driven catalytic assembly.







Abstract
Dynamic interactions of enzymes, including programmable configuration and cycling of enzymes, play important roles in the regulation of cellular metabolism. Here, we constructed a super DNA&#8208;enzymes molecule (SDEM) that comprises at least two cascade enzymes and multiple linked DNA strands to control and detect metabolism. We found that the programmable SDEM, which comprises glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), has a 20&#8208;fold lower detection limit and a 1.6&#8208;fold higher reaction rate than free enzymes. An SDEM can be assembled and disassembled using a hairpin structure and a displacement DNA strand to complete multiple cycles. An entropically driven catalytic assembly (catassembly) enables different SDEMs to switch from an SDEM with GOx and HRP cascades to an SDEM with sarcosine oxidase (SOX) and HRP cascades in over six orders of magnitude less time than without the catassembly to detect different metabolisms (GO and sarcosine) on demand.

Na3.2MnTi0.8V0.2(PO4)3, can realize a reversible 3.2&#8208;electron redox reaction with five redox couples V5+/4+, Mn4+/3+, Mn3+/2+, V4+/3+, and Ti4+/3+, enabling a high discharge capacity and an ultrahigh energy density. In addition, in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction results reveal the highly reversible structural evolution of Na3.2MnTi0.8V0.2(PO4)3 with separate solid&#8208;solution and two&#8208;phase reaction during sodiation/de&#8208;sodiation.







Abstract
Na superionic conductor (NASICON) structured cathode materials with robust structural stability and large Na+ diffusion channels have aroused great interest in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, most of NASICON&#8208;type cathode materials exhibit redox reaction of no more than three electrons per formula, which strictly limits capacity and energy density. Herein, a series of NASICON&#8208;type Na3+xMnTi1&#8722;xVx(PO4)3 cathode materials are designed, which demonstrate not only a multi&#8208;electron reaction but also high voltage platform. With five redox couples from V5+/4+ (&#8776;4.1&#8197;V), Mn4+/3+ (&#8776;4.0&#8197;V), Mn3+/2+ (&#8776;3.6&#8197;V), V4+/3+ (&#8776;3.4&#8197;V), and Ti4+/3+ (&#8776;2.1&#8197;V), the optimized material, Na3.2MnTi0.8V0.2(PO4)3, realizes a reversible 3.2&#8208;electron redox reaction, enabling a high discharge capacity (172.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and an ultrahigh energy density (527.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1). This work sheds light on the rational construction of NASICON&#8208;type cathode materials with multi&#8208;electron redox reaction for high&#8208;energy SIBs.

The integration of new active sites with beneficial defects in Fe&#8208;MOF MIL&#8208;88B catalysts gives enhanced photoreduction of CO2 to C2H4 under visible light. The modified structure promotes the migration and separation of the photoelectrons to produce the pivotal C&#8722;C coupling intermediate for the generation of C2H4, a result supported by in situ FT&#8208;IR analysis.

Rational engineering active sites and vantage defects of catalysts are promising but grand challenging task to enhance photoreduction CO2 to high value&#8208;added C2 products. In this study, we designed an N,S&#8208;codoped Fe&#8208;based MIL&#8208;88B catalyst with well&#8208;defined bipyramidal hexagonal prism morphology via a facile and effective process, which was synthesized by addition of appropriate 1,2&#8208;benzisothiazolin&#8208;3&#8208;one (BIT) and acetic acid to the reaction solution. Under simulated solar irradiation, the designed catalyst exhibits high C2H4 evolution yield of 17.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8901;h, which has been rarely achieved in photocatalytic CO2 reduction process. The synergistic effect of Fe&#8208;N coordinated sites and reasonable defects in the N,S&#8208;codoped photocatalyst can accelerate the migration of photogenerated carriers, resulting in high electron density, and this in turn helps to facilitate the formation and dimerization of C&#8722;C coupling intermediates for C2H4 effectively.

         <title>Multistate Structural Switching of [3]Catenanes with Cyclic Porphyrin Dimers by Complexation with Amine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled switching method has been developed for the multistate switching of catenanes. To verify this concept, a [3]catenane composed of three macrocyclic metalloporphyrin dimers with a rigid &#960;&#8208;backbone was synthesized. Multistate switching of the [3]catenane was achieved by complexation with various amine ligands, with the multistate switching behavior arising from the tunable optical properties of the [3]catenane.







Abstract
Catenanes with multistate switchable properties are promising components for next&#8208;generation molecular machines and supramolecular materials. Herein, we report a ligand&#8208;controlled switching method, a novel method for the multistate switching of catenanes controlled by complexation with added amine ligands. To verify this method, a [3]catenane comprising cyclic porphyrin dimers with a rigid &#960;&#8208;system has been synthesized. Owing to the rigidity, the relative positions among the cyclic components of the [3]catenane can be precisely controlled by complexation with various amine ligands. Moreover, ligand&#8208;controlled multistate switching affects the optical properties of the [3]catenanes: the emission intensity can be tuned by modulating the sizes and coordination numbers of integrated amine ligands. This work shows the utility of using organic ligands for the structural switching of catenanes, and will contribute to the further development of multistate switchable mechanically interlocked molecules.

         <title>Engineered Binding Microenvironments in Halogen Bonding Polymers for Enhanced Anion Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen&#8208;bonding (XB), redox&#8208;active copolymeric hosts are demonstrated to enhance anion binding and sensing performance with respect to their discrete receptive monomers. Through judicious choice of co&#8208;monomers, the local dielectric environment within the polymeric hosts can be modulated, resulting in up to a 50&#8208;fold improvement in binding constant with a XB polymeric host with I&#8722; compared to its monomer.







Abstract
Mimicking Nature's polymeric protein architectures by designing hosts with binding cavities screened from bulk solvent is a promising approach to achieving anion recognition in competitive media. Accomplishing this, however, can be synthetically demanding. Herein we present a synthetically tractable approach, by directly incorporating potent supramolecular anion&#8208;receptive motifs into a polymeric scaffold, tuneable through a judicious selection of the co&#8208;monomer. A comprehensive analysis of anion recognition and sensing is demonstrated with redox&#8208;active, halogen bonding polymeric hosts. Notably, the polymeric hosts consistently outperform their monomeric analogues, with especially large halide binding enhancements of ca. 50&#8208;fold observed in aqueous&#8208;organic solvent mixtures. These binding enhancements are rationalised by the generation and presentation of low dielectric constant binding microenvironments from which there is appreciable solvent exclusion.

This report describes the unprecedented electrooxidation of a solvent (e.g., DMF)&#8208;ligated B2cat2 complex, whereby a solvent&#8208;stabilized boryl radical is formed via quasi&#8208;homolytic cleavage of the B&#8722;B bond in a DMF&#8208;ligated B2cat2 radical cation.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Fueled Transient Breathing Nanogels that Couple Nonequilibrium Catalytic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer nanogel can perform polymerization with every breath it takes. CO2 binding to the nanogel activates its catalytic capacity and initiates a CO2&#8208;involved nonequilibrium polymerization that reversely depletes the fuel. This transient system can function as a gas&#8208;powered nanosynthesizer for automatic production of polymer on&#8208;demand.







Abstract
Here we present a &#8220;breathing&#8221; nanogel that is fueled by CO2 gas to perform temporally programmable catalytic polymerization. The nanogel is composed of common frustrated Lewis pair polymers (FLPs). Dynamic CO2&#8208;FLP gas&#8208;bridging bonds endow the nanogel with a transient volume contraction, and the resulting proximal effect of bound FLPs unlocks its catalytic capacity toward CO2. Reverse gas depletion via a CO2&#8208;participated polymerization can induce a reverse nanogel expansion, which shuts down the catalytic activity. Control of external factors (fuel level, temperature or additives) can regulate the breathing period, amplitude and lifecycle, so as to affect the catalytic polymerization. Moreover, editing the nanogel breathing procedure can sequentially evoke the copolymerization of CO2 with different epoxide monomers preloaded therein, which allows to obtain block&#8208;tunable copolycarbonates that are unachievable by other methods. This synthetic dissipative system would be function as a prototype of gas&#8208;driven nanosynthesizer.

         <title>Modulating the Differentiation of Kinetically Controlled Supramolecular Polymerizations through the Alkyl Bridge Length</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of N&#8208;annulated perylene bisimides (N&#8208;PBIs) has demonstrated that the ability of these units to generate different polymorphs upon supramolecular polymerization decreases as the length of the alkyl bridge separating the peripheral side chains and the central aromatic backbones decreases. The kinetically controlled supramolecular polymerization of these N&#8208;PBIs has also been investigated.







Abstract
The synthesis and self&#8208;assembling features of N&#8208;annulated perylenebisimides (N&#8208;PBIs) 2&#8211;4 are reported and compared with the complex self&#8208;assembly of N&#8208;PBI 1. The studies presented herein demonstrate that increasing the length of the alkyl spacer separating the central aromatic core of the dye and the peripheral side chains cancels the differentiation on the corresponding supramolecular polymerization. Thus, only 2 is able to form two different supramolecular polymorphs. The formation of kinetically trapped monomeric species is observed for all the N&#8208;PBIs 2&#8211;4. These metastable species, constituted by intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded pseudocycles of 7, 8, 9, or 10 members for compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, provoke kinetically controlled supramolecular polymerizations that can be accelerated by the addition of seeds. The results presented herein shed light on the intricate process of differentiation in self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Elucidation of the Alternating Copolymerization Mechanism of Epoxides or Aziridines with Cyclic Anhydrides in the Presence of Halide Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chain&#8208;end coordination processes have been reported to promote highly active and selective ROCOP. The complex behavior of salts in the copolymerizations have led to the elucidation of the alternating copolymerization mechanism.







Abstract
Organic halide salts in combination with metal or organic compound are the most common and essential catalysts in ring&#8208;opening copolymerizations (ROCOP). However, the role of organic halide salts was neglected. Here, we have uncovered the complex behavior of organic halides in ROCOP of epoxides or aziridine with cyclic anhydride. Coordination of the chain&#8208;ends to cations, electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, leaving ability of halide atoms, chain&#8208;end basicity/nucleophilicity, and terminal steric hindrance cause three types of side reactions: single&#8208;site transesterification, substitution, and elimination. Understanding the complex functions of organic halide salts in ROCOP led us to develop highly active and selective aminocyclopropenium chlorides as catalysts/initiators. Adjustable H&#8208;bonding interactions of aminocyclopropenium with propagating anions and epoxides create chain&#8208;end coordination process that generate highly reactive carboxylate and highly selective alkoxide chain&#8208;ends.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalysed Rearrangement of Cyclic Ethynylethylene Carbonates: Synthetic Applications and Mechanistic Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented copper&#8208;catalysed rearrangement of cyclic ethynylethylene carbonates has been discovered, and the in situ&#8208;formed allenal intermediates could react with a range of nucleophiles to furnish synthetically useful and highly functionalised products through the addition pathways. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds through the base&#8208;mediated deprotonation as the key step to induce the rearrangement.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed reactions of cyclic ethynylethylene carbonates have been intensively studied because of their robustness in new bond formation and diversified molecule construction. Known reaction modes usually involve a substitution step occurring at either the propargylic or terminal alkyne positions. Here, we report an unprecedented reaction pattern in which cyclic ethynylethylene carbonates first undergo a rearrangement to release allenal intermediates, which subsequently react with diverse nucleophiles to furnish synthetically useful allylic and propargylic allenols, phosphorus ylides, and cyclopropylidene ketones through an addition process rather than a substitution pathway. The products enable various further transformations, and mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations reveal that the reaction does not proceed via a semipinacol type [1,2]&#8208;hydride shift, but through base&#8208;mediated deprotonation as the key step to induce the rearrangement.

         <title>Fabrication of Super&#8208;Sized Metal Inorganic&#8208;Organic Hybrid Glass with Supramolecular Network via Crystallization&#8208;Suppressing Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal inorganic&#8208;organic complex glass with supramolecular network was synthesized by the crystallization&#8208;suppressing strategy. The prepared glass possesses interesting optical and structural properties such as high transparency, shaping capability, and anisotropic structure. The dyes&#8208;doped hybrid glass exhibits polarized light with a polarization ratio up to 47&#8201;%.







Abstract
Metal coordination compound (MCC) glasses [e.g., metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) glass, coordination polymer glass, and metal inorganic&#8208;organic complex (MIOC) glass] are emerging members of the hybrid glass family. So far, a limited number of crystalline MCCs can be converted into glasses by melt&#8208;quenching. Here, we report a universal wet&#8208;chemistry method, by which the super&#8208;sized supramolecular MIOC glasses can be synthesized from non&#8208;meltable MOFs. Alcohol and acid were used as agents to inhibit crystallization. The MIOC glasses demonstrate unique features including high transparency, shaping capability, and anisotropic network. Directional photoluminescence with a large polarization ratio (&#8776;47&#8201;%) was observed from samples doped with organic dyes. This crystallization&#8208;suppressing approach enables fabrication of super&#8208;sized MCC glasses, which cannot be achieved by conventional vitrification methods, and thus allows for exploring new MCC glasses possessing photonic functionalities.

         <title>Orthogonal Trichromatic Upconversion with High Color Purity in Core&#8208;Shell Nanoparticles for a Full&#8208;Color Display</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current upconversion&#8208;based display systems generally require excitation pulse modulation or multiple near&#8208;infrared pumping for full&#8208;color tuning, which may cause deleterious effects associated with complex procedure and low color purity. To this end, we present a dual&#8208;channel pump scheme to fine&#8208;control emission in the full color range from core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured upconversion nanoparticles.







Abstract
Materials with tunable emission colors has attracted increasing interest in both fundamental research and applications. As a key member of light&#8208;emitting materials family, lanthanide doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have been intensively demonstrated to emit light in any color upon near&#8208;infrared excitation. However, realizing the trichromatic emission in UCNPs with a fixed composition remains a great challenge. Here, without excitation pulsed modulation and three different near&#8208;infrared pumping, we report an experimental design to fine&#8208;control emission in the full color gamut from core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured UCNPs by manipulating the energy migration through dual&#8208;channel pump scheme. We also demonstrate their potential application in full&#8208;color display. These findings may benefit the future development of convenient and versatile optical methos for multicolor tuning and open up the possibility of constructing full&#8208;color volumetric display systems with high spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>A Photoisomerizable Zinc (II) Complex Inhibits Microtubule Polymerization for Photoactive Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights a photoisomerizable zinc(II) complex (Zn1), which has a promising application prospect in photoactive therapy through photoisomerization. Zn1 can release its trans ligand after light irradiation, undergo photoisomerization to produce toxic cis product and generate 1O2 in the meantime. The series of changes lead to photo&#8208;triggered toxicity against cancer cells and cause microtubule breakdown.







Abstract
The photoisomerization&#8208;induced cytotoxicity in photopharmacology provides a unique pathway for phototherapy because it is independent of endogenous oxygen. In this study, we developed a biosafe photoisomerizable zinc(II) complex (Zn1), which releases its trans ligand (trans&#8208;L1) after being irradiated with blue light. This causes the complex to undergo photoisomerization and produce the toxic cis product (cis&#8208;L1) and generate singlet oxygen (1O2). The resulting series of events caused impressive phototoxicity in hypoxic A431 skin cancer cells, as well as in a tumor model in vivo. Interestingly, Zn1 was able to inhibit tumor microtubule polymerization, while still showing good biocompatibility and biosafety in vivo. This photoisomerizable zinc(II) complex provides a novel strategy for addressing the oxygen&#8208;dependent limitation of traditional photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Hydroxylation with Unusual Stereoinversion Catalyzed by an FeII/2&#8208;OG Dependent Oxidase and 3,6&#8208;Diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine Formation in the Biosynthesis of Brevianamide&#8197;K</title>

         <dc:description>
Unlike the known biosynthetic pathways for the 3,6&#8208;diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine substructure in bacteria, double&#8208;bond installation by heme&#8208;dependent AspF, unprecedented stereoinversion upon hydroxylation by FeII/2&#8208;OG&#8208;dependent AspE, and subsequent dehydration lead to the formation of the 3,6&#8208;diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine substructure of brevianamide K in the fungus Aspergillus sp. SK&#8208;28.







Abstract
Natural products with the 3,6&#8208;diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine core are widely distributed in nature; however, the biosynthetic mechanism of 3,6&#8208;diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine in fungi remains to be further elucidated. Through heterologous expression and biochemical investigation of an FeII/2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent oxidase (AspE) and a heme&#8208;dependent P450 enzyme (AspF), we report that AspE, AspF and subsequent dehydration account for the formation of the 3,6&#8208;diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine substructure of brevianamide K from Aspergillus sp. SK&#8208;28, a symbiotic fungus of mangrove plant Kandelia candel. More interestingly, in&#8208;depth investigation of the enzymatic mechanism showed that AspE promotes hydroxylation of brevianamide Q with unprecedented stereoinversion through hydrogen atom abstraction and water nucleophilic attack from the opposite face of the resultant iminium cation intermediate.

         <title>Engineered Artificial Membraneless Organelles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae To Enhance Chemical Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial membraneless organelle (MLO) was designed to increase the production efficiency of fine chemicals by S.&#8197;cerevisiae. The size and rigidity of the membraneless organelles were adjusted to decrease the concentration of toxic formaldehyde and to induce a switch from oxidative glycolysis to non&#8208;oxidative glycolysis. Consequently, the methanol assimilation efficiency and the n&#8208;butanol yield increased significantly.







Abstract
Microbial cell factories provide a green and sustainable opportunity to produce value&#8208;added products from renewable feedstock. However, the leakage of toxic or volatile intermediates decreases the efficiency of microbial cell factories. In this study, membraneless organelles (MLOs) were reconstructed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by the disordered protein sequence A&#8208;IDPs. A regulation system was designed to spatiotemporally regulate the size and rigidity of MLOs. Manipulating the MLO size of strain ZP03&#8208;FM, the amounts of assimilated methanol and malate were increased by 162&#8201;% and 61&#8201;%, respectively. Furthermore, manipulating the MLO rigidity in strain ZP04&#8208;RB made acetyl&#8208;coA synthesis from oxidative glycolysis change to non&#8208;oxidative glycolysis; consequently, CO2 release decreased by 35&#8201;% and the n&#8208;butanol yield increased by 20&#8201;%. This artificial MLO provides a strategy for the co&#8208;localization of enzymes to channel C1 starting materials into value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>NH4+ Deprotonation at Interfaces Induced Reversible H3O+/NH4+ Co&#8208;insertion/Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accumulation of NH4+ on the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface was probed by in situ ATR&#8208;FTIR. The formed NH4+&#8208;rich domain induces the formation of protons. Subsequently, proton co&#8208;insertion into VO2 happens, which achieved fast ion storage (charge/discharge in &lt;20&#8197;s) and high capacity (&gt;300&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and was revealed by in situ XRD and DFT calculation.







Abstract
Ion insertions always involve electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface process, desolvation for instance, which determines the electrochemical kinetics. However, it&#8242;s still a challenge to achieve fast ion insertion and investigate ion transformation at interface. Herein, the interface deprotonation of NH4+ and the introduced dissociation of H2O molecules to provide sufficient H3O+ to insert into materials&#8242; structure for fast energy storages are revealed. Lewis acidic ion&#8208;NH4+ can, on one hand provide H3O+ itself via deprotonation, and on the other hand hydrolyze with H2O molecules to produce H3O+. In situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;Fourier transform infrared ray method probed the interface accumulation and deprotonation of NH4+, and density functional theory calculations manifested that NH4+ tend to thermodynamically adsorb on the surface of monoclinic VO2, and deprotonate to provide H3O+. In addition, the inserted NH4+ has a positive effect for stabilizing the VO2(B) structure. Therefore, high specific capacity (&gt;300&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and fast ionic insertion/extraction (&lt;20&#8197;s) can be realized in VO2(B) anode. This interface derivation proposes a new path for designing proton ion insertion/extraction in mild electrolyte.

         <title>On the Edge of the Known: Extremely Electron&#8208;Rich (Di)Carboranyl Phosphines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
B9&#8208;Phos: B9&#8208;functionalized carboranylphosphines with bulky electron&#8208;donating substituents display an extremely electron&#8208;releasing character surpassing the donor strength of alkyl phosphines and even commonly used N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. In addition, they exert a high steric demand which allows the mesityl derivatives to form stabilized phosphoniumyl radical cations. The dicarboranyl phosphine AuI complexes show superior catalytic performance in the hydroamination of alkynes compared to the monocarboranyl phosphine analogs.







Abstract
The syntheses of the first B9&#8208;connected carboranylphosphines (B9&#8208;Phos) featuring two carboranyl moieties as well as access to B9&#8208;Phos ligands with bulky electron&#8208;donating substituents, previously deemed unattainable, is reported. The electrochemical properties of the B9&#8208;Phos ligands were investigated, revealing the ability of the mesityl derivatives to form stabilized phosphoniumyl radical cations. The B9&#8208;Phos ligands display an extremely electron&#8208;releasing character surpassing that of alkyl phosphines and commonly used N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. This is demonstrated by their very small Tolman electronic parameters (TEPs) as well as extremely low P&#8722;Se coupling constants. Cone angles and buried volumes attest to the high steric demand exerted by the (di)carboranyl phosphines. The dicarboranyl phosphine AuI complexes show superior catalytic performance in the hydroamination of alkynes compared to the monocarboranyl phosphine analogs.

         <title>Enzyme Engineering for High&#8208;Yielding Amide Formation: Lipase&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of N&#8208;Acyl Glycines in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;acyl glycines are essential biosurfactants in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Their commercial production involves the use of neurotoxic phosgene. Aiming towards green synthesis of these amides, we developed a novel amide synthesis concept involving glycerol activation and evolved a hydrolytic enzyme by reshaping its catalytic pocket into a highly active amide bond&#8208;forming enzyme, displaying 400&#8208;fold higher catalytic efficiency for N&#8208;lauroylglycine synthesis with over 80&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Amide syntheses remain a key challenging green chemistry reaction. For instance, green synthesis of N&#8208;acyl glycines as biosurfactants and therapeutics is highly desirable to replace chemical pathways using toxic phosgene. Herein, we report a novel concept for enzymatic amidation in an aqueous system via glycerol activation of fatty acids and theirsubsequent aminolysis with glycine to synthesize N&#8208;acyl glycines. We then engineer an enzyme (proRML) by reshaping its catalytic pocket to enhance its aminolysis activity and catalytic efficiency by 103&#8208;fold and 465&#8208;fold, respectively. The evolved proRML (D156S/L258K/L267N/S83D/L58K/R86K/W88V) catalyzed the amidation of a fatty acid with glycine to give N&#8208;lauroylglycine with high yield (80&#8201;%). It accepts a broad range of medium&#8208; to long&#8208;chain fatty acids (C8&#8211;C18), giving high yields of N&#8208;decanoyl&#8208;, N&#8208;myristoyl&#8208;, and N&#8208;oleoylglycine. The developed amidation concept may be general, and the engineered enzyme is useful for the green synthesis of N&#8208;acyl glycines.

         <title>Peroxodicarbonate as a Green Oxidizer for the Selective Degradation of Kraft Lignin into Vanillin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidative conversion of technical Kraft lignin into vanillin is reported in high yields. Through the ex&#8208;cell electrolysis of aqueous carbonate, peroxodicarbonate is produced and serves as a &#8220;green&#8221; oxidizer for the degradation of lignin.







Abstract
Lignin, the world's largest resource of renewable aromatics, with annually roughly 50 million tons of accruing technical lignin, mainly Kraft lignin, is highly underdeveloped regarding the production of monoaromatics. We demonstrate the oxidative depolymerization of Kraft lignin at 180&#8201;&#176;C to produce vanillin 1 in yields up to 6.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% and 92&#8201;% referred to the maximum yield gained from the quantification reaction utilizing nitrobenzene. Using peroxodicarbonate (C2O62&#8722;) as &#8220;green&#8221; oxidizer for the degradation, toxic and/or harmful reagents are prevented. Also, the formed waste can serve as makeup chemical in the pulping process. Na2C2O6 is synthesized in an ex&#8208;cell electrolysis of aqueous Na2CO3 at BDD anodes, achieving a yield of Na2C2O6 with 41&#8201;%. At least, the oxidation and degradation of Kraft lignin is analysis via UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Wide&#8208;coverage and Efficient NIR Emission from Single&#8208;component Nanophosphors through Shaping Multiple Metal&#8208;halide Packages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widest&#8208;coverage single&#8208;component near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission (850&#8211;1650&#8197;nm) with the high NIR photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 20.3&#8201;% in Sm3+, Nd3+, Er3+ triple&#8208;doped Cs2K0.5Rb0.5(In0.95Sb0.05)Cl6 NCs is achieved. The remarkable results are attributed to the improved energy transfer efficiency between host and lanthanide (Ln3+) ions and reduced cation site symmetry of Ln3+ ions due to alkali metal substitution.







Abstract
Wide&#8208;coverage near infrared (NIR) phosphor&#8208;converted LEDs possess promising potential for practical applications, but little is developed towards the efficient and wide&#8208;coverage NIR phosphors. Here, we report the single&#8208;component lanthanide (Ln3+) ions doped Cs2M(In0.95Sb0.05)Cl6 (M=alkali metal) nanocrystals (NCs), exhibiting emission from 850 to 1650&#8197;nm with high photoluminescence quantum yield of 20.3&#8201;%, which is accomplished by shaping the multiple metal halide octahedra of double perovskite via the simple alkali metal substitution. From Judd&#8208;Ofelt theoretical calculation and spectroscopic investigations, the shaping of metal halide octahedra in Cs2M(In1&#8722;xSbx)Cl6 NCs can break the forbidden of f&#8208;f transition of Ln3+, thus increasing their radiative transition rates and simultaneously boosting the energy transfer efficiency from host to Ln3+. Finally, the wide&#8208;coverage NIR LEDs based on Sm3+, Nd3+, Er3+&#8208;tridoped Cs2K0.5Rb0.5(In0.95Sb0.05)Cl6 NCs are fabricated and employed in the multiplex gas sensing and night&#8208;vision application.

         <title>The Origin of Solvent Deprotonation in LiI&#8208;added Aprotic Electrolytes for Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fundamentals behind undesirable side reactions (solvent deprotonation) in LiI&#8208;added Li&#8208;O2 batteries have been controversial since LiI was reported to enable 4e&#8722; redox reactions in 2015. However, LiBr is free from such issues. Here, we predict and confirm that it is the side product (
 that triggers the solvent deprotonation.







Abstract
LiI and LiBr have been employed as soluble redox mediators (RMs) in electrolytes to address the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction kinetics during charging in aprotic Li&#8208;O2 batteries. Compared to LiBr, LiI exhibits a redox potential closer to the theoretical one of discharge products, indicating a higher energy efficiency. However, the reason for the occurrence of solvent deprotonation in LiI&#8208;added electrolytes remains unclear. Here, by combining ab initio calculations and experimental validation, we find that it is the nucleophile 
 that triggers the solvent deprotonation and LiOH formation via nucleophilic attack, rather than the increased solvent acidity or the elongated C&#8722;H bond as previously suggested. As a comparison, the formation of 
 in LiBr&#8208;added electrolytes is found to be thermodynamically unfavorable, explaining the absence of LiOH formation. These findings provide important insight into the solvent deprotonation and pave the way for the practical application of LiI RM in aprotic Li&#8208;O2 batteries.

         <title>Camouflaged Virus&#8208;Like&#8208;Nanocarrier with a Transformable Rough Surface for Boosting Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanocarrier with variable surface roughness was designed. At physiological pH, the virus&#8208;like spikes are hidden by a polymer shell, which effectively inhibits the non&#8208;specific strong nano&#8211;bio interaction between the nanocarrier and protein/normal tissue induced by the rough surface. In the acidic tumor microenvironment, the nanocarrier sheds the polymer camouflage to re&#8208;expose its rough surface, thus promoting endocytosis of the nanocarrier by tumor cells.







Abstract
Due to non&#8208;specific strong nano&#8211;bio interactions, it is difficult for nanocarriers with permanent rough surface to cross multiple biological barriers to realize efficient drug delivery. Herein, a camouflaged virus&#8208;like&#8208;nanocarrier with a transformable rough surface is reported, which is composed by an interior virus&#8208;like mesoporous SiO2 nanoparticle with a rough surface (vSiO2) and an exterior acid&#8208;responsive polymer. Under normal physiological pH condition, the spikes on vSiO2 are hidden by the polymer shell, and the non&#8208;specific strong nano&#8211;bio interactions are effectively inhibited. While in the acidic tumor microenvironment, the nanocarrier sheds the polymer camouflage to re&#8208;expose its rough surface. So, the retention ability and endocytosis efficiency of the nanocarrier are great improved. Owing to it's the dynamically variable rough surface, the rationally designed nanocarrier exhibits extended blood&#8208;circulation&#8208;time and enhanced tumor accumulation.

         <title>Enzyme Translocation&#8208;Mediated Signal Amplification for Spatially Selective Aptasensing of ATP in Inflammatory Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatically triggerable, aptamer&#8208;based signal amplification approach is developed to achieve inflammatory cell&#8208;selective ATP imaging in vitro and in vivo. The system relies on enzyme translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm in inflammatory cells, which activate an aptasensor for ATP recognition and further initiate cascade reactions for signal amplification.







Abstract
Amplified ATP imaging in inflammatory cells is highly desirable. However, the spatial selectivity of current amplification methods is limited, that is, signal amplification is performed systemically and not in a disease site&#8208;specific manner. Here we present a versatile strategy, termed enzymatically triggerable, aptamer&#8208;based signal amplification (ETA&#8208;SA), that enables inflammatory cell&#8208;specific imaging of ATP through spatially&#8208;resolved signal amplification. The ETA&#8208;SA leverages a translocated enzyme in inflammatory cells to activate DNA aptamer probes and further drive cascade reactions through the consumption of hairpin fuels, which, however, exerts no ATP response activity in normal cells, leading to a significantly improved sensitivity and spatial specificity for the inflammation&#8208;specific ATP imaging in vivo. Benefiting from the improved spatial selectivity, enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios were achieved for ATP imaging during acute hepatitis.

         <title>Interface Design Enabling Stable Polymer/Thiophosphate Electrolyte Separators for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEGDME with a substituted terminal group not only stabilizes the polymer/thiophosphate interfaces but also extends the electrochemical window of the composite SE. A LiF&#8208;rich SEI studied by in situ XPS and time&#8208;dependent EIS protects the Li metal anode against the dendrite growth. The stable interfaces in the PEGDME/LPSCl composite SE enable homogeneous lithium plating/stripping for both Li symmetric cells and Li/LiNi0.85Co0.1Mn0.05O2 cells.







Abstract
Organic/inorganic interfaces greatly affect Li+ transport in composite solid electrolytes (SEs), while SE/electrode interfacial stability plays a critical role in the cycling performance of solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs). However, incomplete understanding of interfacial (in)stability hinders the practical application of composite SEs in SSBs. Herein, chemical degradation between Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is revealed. The high polarity of PEG changes the electronic state and structural bonding of the PS43&#8722; tetrahedra, thus triggering a series of side reactions. A substituted terminal group of PEG not only stabilizes the inner interfaces but also extends the electrochemical window of the composite SE. Moreover, a LiF&#8208;rich layer can effectively prevent side reactions at the Li/SE interface. The results provide insights into the chemical stability of polymer/sulfide composites and demonstrate an interface design to achieve dendrite&#8208;free lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Evolution of Stabilized 1T&#8208;MoS2 by Atomic&#8208;Interface Engineering of 2H&#8208;MoS2/Fe&#8722;Nx towards Enhanced Sodium Ion Storage</title>

These findings on the evolution of stabilized 1T&#8208;MoS2 will strengthen our comprehensive knowledge of electronic structure optimization strategy and pave the way for the design of other heterostructures materials for high&#8208;performance energy storage.







Abstract
Metallic conductive 1T phase molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) has been identified as promising anode for sodium ion (Na+) batteries, but its metastable feature makes it difficult to obtain and its restacking during the charge/discharge processing result in part capacity reversibility. Herein, a synergetic effect of atomic&#8208;interface engineering is employed for constructing 2H&#8208;MoS2 layers assembled on single atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C (SA Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) anode material that boosts its reversible capacity. The work&#8208;function&#8208;driven&#8208;electron transfer occurs from SA Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C to 2H&#8208;MoS2 via the Fe&#8722;S bonds, which enhances the adsorption of Na+ by 2H&#8208;MoS2, and lays the foundation for the sodiation process. A phase transfer from 2H to 1T/2H MoS2 with the ferromagnetic spin&#8208;polarization of SA Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C occurs during the sodiation/desodiation process, which significantly enhances the Na+ storage kinetics, and thus the 1T/2H MoS2/SA Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C display a high electronic conductivity and a fast Na+ diffusion rate.

A phase transfer from 2H to 1T/2H MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the ferromagnetic spin-polarization of SA Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C occurs during the sodiation/desodiation process, which significantly enhances the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage kinetics, and thus the 1T/2H MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/SA Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C display a high electronic conductivity and a fast Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion rate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cathode Electrolyte Interphase (CEI) Endows Mo6S8 with Fast Interfacial Magnesium&#8208;Ion Transfer Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) layer can be constructed on the surface of a Mo6S8 cathode through the oxidation of a boron&#8208;centered magnesium salt. This CEI layer is favorable for the desolvation of Mg2+, so that the chloride&#8208;free magnesium electrolyte can support the effective cycling of magnesium batteries.







Abstract
Magnesium (Mg) metal secondary batteries have attracted much attention for their high safety and high energy density characteristics. However, the significant issues of the cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) in Mg batteries are still being ignored. In this work, a significant CEI layer on the typical Mo6S8 cathode surface has been unprecedentedly constructed through the oxidation of the chloride&#8208;free magnesium tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy)borate (Mg[B(hfip)4]2) salt under a proper charge cut&#8208;off voltage condition. The CEI has been identified to contain BxOy effective species originating from the oxidation of [B(hfip)4]&#8722; anion. It is confirmed that the BxOy species is beneficial to the desolvation of solvated Mg2+, speeding up the interfacial Mg2+ transfer kinetics, thereby improving the Mg2+&#8208;storage capability of Mo6S8 host. The firstly reported CEI in Mg batteries will give deeper insights into the interface issues in multivalent electrochemical systems.

         <title>Revealing the Mechanism of Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission in Layered Silver&#8208;Bismuth Double Perovskites</title>

A pressure&#8208;driven self&#8208;trapping exciton transformation from dark to bright state was achieved in low&#8208;dimensional halide perovskites, revealing the physicochemical mechanism of pressure&#8208;induced emission.







Abstract
Pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) associated with self&#8208;trapping excitons (STEs) in low&#8208;dimensional halide perovskites has attracted great attention for better materials&#8208;by&#8208;design. Here, using 2D layered double perovskite (C6H5CH2CH2NH3+)4AgBiBr8 as a model system, we advance a fundamental physicochemical mechanism of the PIE from the perspective of carrier dynamics and excited&#8208;state behaviors of local lattice distortion. We observed a pressure&#8208;driven STE transformation from dark to bright states, corresponding a strong broadband Stokes&#8208;shifted emission. Further theoretical analysis demonstrated that the suppressed lattice distortion and enhanced electronic dimensionality in the excited&#8208;state play an important role in the formation of stabilized bright STEs, which could manipulate the self&#8208;trapping energy and lattice deformation energy to form an energy barrier between the potential energy curves of ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state, and enhance the electron&#8208;hole orbital overlap, respectively.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers through Enantioselective Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient enantioselective desymmetrization protocol is disclosed for the asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers by using a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic aromatic amination. This method features broad substrate scope, high yields and high enantioselectivity. The facile derivatization of various products into a series of structurally novel azaarene&#8208;containing diaryl ether atropisomers was also demonstrated.







Abstract
Axially chiral diaryl ethers are a type of unique atropisomers bearing two potential axes, which have potential applications in a variety of research fields. However, the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of these diaryl ether atropisomers is largely underexplored when compared to the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of biaryl or other types of atropisomers. Herein, we report a highly efficient catalytic asymmetric synthesis of diaryl ether atropisomers through an organocatalyzed enantioselective desymmetrization protocol. The chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric electrophilic aromatic aminations of the symmetrical 1,3&#8208;benzenediamine type substrates afforded a series of diaryl ether atropisomers in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The facile construction of heterocycles by the utilizations of the 1,2&#8208;benzenediamine moiety in the products provided access to a variety of structurally diverse and novel azaarene&#8208;containing diaryl ether atropisomers.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;mediated Aqueous Synthesis of NIR&#8208;II Emitting Ag2S Quantum Dots for Rapid Photocatalytic Bacteria Disinfection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emitting AgBP2&#8208;Ag2S QDs were successfully synthesized based on a silver&#8208;binding polypeptide AgBP2 under mild conditions and served as photothermal agents for antibacterial activity. Owing to the synergistic effects of photogenerated ROS and hyperthermia, the obtained AgBP2&#8208;Ag2S QDs exhibited an effective disinfection efficacy of 99.06&#8201;% against E.&#8197;coli within 25&#8197;min of NIR irradiation.







Abstract
Pathogenic microorganisms in the environment are a great threat to global human health. The development of disinfection method with rapid and effective antibacterial properties is urgently needed. In this study, a biomimetic silver binding peptide AgBP2 was introduced to develop a facile synthesis of biocompatible Ag2S quantum dots (QDs). The AgBP2 capped Ag2S QDs exhibited excellent fluorescent emission in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window, with physical stability and photostability in the aqueous phase. Under 808&#8197;nm NIR laser irradiation, AgBP2&#8208;Ag2S QDs can serve not only as a photothermal agent to realize NIR photothermal conversion but also as a photocatalyst to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). The obtained AgBP2&#8208;Ag2S QDs achieved a highly effective disinfection efficacy of 99.06&#8201;% against Escherichia coli within 25&#8197;min of NIR irradiation, which was ascribed to the synergistic effects of photogenerated ROS during photocatalysis and hyperthermia. Our work demonstrated a promising strategy for efficient bacterial disinfection.

         <title>Tailor&#8208;Made PdnL2n Metal&#8208;Organic Cages through Covalent Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two PdnL2n (n=2, 12) type metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) decorated with anthracene groups have been successfully functionalized by a covalent post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) approach. This has led to the modified MOCs having new functions compared to the parent MOCs (e.g., concentration&#8208;dependent chirality, aggregation&#8208;induced emission, and chirality&#8208;induced circularly polarized luminescence).







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) is an effective approach for the tailored functionalization of metal&#8208;organic architectures, but its generalizability remains challenging. Herein we report a general covalent PSM strategy to functionalize PdnL2n metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs, n=2, 12) through an efficient Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition between peripheral anthracene substituents and various functional motifs bearing a maleimide group. As expected, the solubility of functionalized Pd12L24 in common solvents can be greatly improved. Interestingly, concentration&#8208;dependent circular dichroism and aggregation&#8208;induced emission are achieved with chiral binaphthol (BINOL)&#8208; and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;modified Pd12L24, respectively. Furthermore, Pd12L24 can be introduced with two different functional groups (e.g., chiral BINOL and achiral pyrene) through a step&#8208;by&#8208;step PSM route to obtain chirality&#8208;induced circularly polarized luminescence. Moreover, similar results are readily observed with a smaller Pd2L4 system.

         <title>Microwave Synthesis of Pt Clusters on Black TiO2 with Abundant Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Acidic Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>

Black TiO2 supported sub&#8208;nanometer Pt clusters (Pt/TiO2&#8208;OV) are designed through solvent&#8208;free microwave and subsequent electroless approach. Pt/TiO2&#8208;OV presents remarkable electrocatalytic performance with 18&#8197;mV to achieve 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial Pt/C.







Abstract
Oxygen vacancies&#8208;enriched black TiO2 is one promising support for enhancing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, oxygen vacancies enriched black TiO2 supported sub&#8208;nanometer Pt clusters (Pt/TiO2&#8208;OV) with metal support interactions is designed through solvent&#8208;free microwave and following low&#8208;temperature electroless approach for the first time. High&#8208;temperature and strong reductants are not required and then can avoid the aggregation of decorated Pt species. Experimental and theoretical calculation verify that the created oxygen vacancies and Pt clusters exhibit synergistic effects for optimizing the reaction kinetics. Based on it, Pt/TiO2&#8208;OV presents remarkable electrocatalytic performance with 18&#8197;mV to achieve 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 coupled with small Tafel slope of 12&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. This work provides quick synthetic strategy for preparing black titanium dioxide based nanomaterials.

         <title>A Pair of Interconverting Cages Formed from Achiral Precursors Spontaneously Resolve into Homochiral Conformers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from achiral precursors homochirality can be achieved by first forming a pair of enantiomers without inversion center or mirror image (mathematical criterium), followed by their narcissistic self&#8208;sorting driven by multivalent intermolecular interactions that follow the helical trajectory of screw symmetry of the resulting enantiopure crystals (chemical criterium).







Abstract
Without chiral induction the emergence of homochirality from achiral molecules is rather serendipitous, as the rationale is somewhat ambiguous. We herein provide a plausible solution. From achiral precursors are formed a pair of interconverting cage conformers that exhibit a C3&#8208;axis as the only symmetry element. When their interconversion is impeded with intramolecular H&#8208;bonding, each conformer self&#8208;sorts into a homochiral crystal, which is driven by a helical network of multivalent intermolecular interactions during the self&#8208;assembly of homochiral cage conformers. As no chiral induction is involved throughout, we believe our study could enlighten the rational design for the emergence of homochirality with several criteria: 1) formation of a molecule without inversion center or mirror plane; 2) suppression of the enantiomeric interconversion, and introduction of multivalent interactions along the helical trajectory of screw symmetry within the resulting superstructure.

         <title>Supramolecular Shish Kebabs: Higher Order Dimeric Structures from Ring&#8208;in&#8208;Rings Complexes with Conformational Adaptivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple 2D H&#8208;bonded macrocycles are threaded onto a box&#8208;like cationic cyclophane, which further assembles into higher order dimeric shish&#8208;kebab&#8208;like structures. Such ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) superstructures maximize their stability through the conformational adaptivity of both host and guest.







Abstract
Use of abiotic chemical systems for understanding higher order superstructures is challenging. Here we report a ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) system comprising a hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycle and cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;o&#8208;phenylene) tetracation (o&#8208;Box) or cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) tetracation (CBPQT4+, p&#8208;Box) that assembles to construct discrete higher order structures with adaptive conformation. As indicated by mass spectrometry, computational modeling, NMR spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, this ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) system features the box&#8208;directed aggregation of multiple macrocycles, leading to generation of several stable species such as H4G (1&#8201;a/o&#8208;Box) and H5G (1&#8201;a/o&#8208;Box). Remarkably, a dimeric shish&#8208;kebab&#8208;like ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings superstructure H7G2 (1&#8201;a/o&#8208;Box) or H8G2 (1&#8201;a/p&#8208;Box) is formed from the coaxial stacking of two ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings units. The formation of such unique dimeric superstructures is attributed to the large &#960;&#8208;surface of this 2D planar macrocycle and the conformational variation of both host and guest.

The synthesis of ordered, functionalized carbon nanothreads remains a challenge. Herein we report the scalable solid&#8208;state polymerization of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid. The resulting nanothread is functionalized with a high density of pendant carboxyl groups, enabling new opportunities for post&#8208;synthetic modification. Several 3d metals are demonstrated to bind to the backbone, opening the door to the use of nanothreads in advanced applications.







Abstract
Compared with conventional, solution&#8208;phase approaches, solid&#8208;state reaction methods can provide unique access to novel synthetic targets. Nanothreads&#8212;one&#8208;dimensional diamondoid polymers formed through the compression of small molecules&#8212;represent a new class of materials produced via solid&#8208;state reactions, however, the formation of chemically homogeneous products with targeted functionalization represents a persistent challenge. Through careful consideration of molecular precursor stacking geometry and functionalization, we report here the scalable synthesis of chemically homogeneous, functionalized nanothreads through the solid&#8208;state polymerization of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid. The resulting product possesses high&#8208;density, pendant carboxyl functionalization along both sides of the backbone, enabling new opportunities for the post&#8208;synthetic processing and chemical modification of nanothread materials applicable to a broad range of potential applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Supramolecular A8Bn Miktoarm Star Copolymers by Host&#8208;Guest Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular A8Bn (n=1, 2, 4) miktoarm star copolymers have been fabricated by host&#8211;guest complexation between a resorcinarene&#8208;based coordination capsule possessing eight polystyrene chains and 4,4&#8208;diacetoxy biphenyl guest molecules with one, two, or four polymethyl acrylate chains. The stability of the A8B1, A8B2, and A8B4 miktoarm polymers was influenced by the number of polymethyl acrylate chains in the guest polymers.







Abstract
We report a new synthetic method to construct supramolecular A8Bn (n=1, 2, 4) miktoarm star copolymers by host&#8208;guest complexation between a resorcinarene&#8208;based coordination capsule possessing eight polystyrene chains and 4,4&#8208;diacetoxybiphenyl guest molecules that retain one, two or four polymethyl acrylate chains. The formation of the supramolecular A8Bn (n=1, 2, 4) miktoarm star copolymers was confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS), size&#8208;exclusion chromatography (SEC), and diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements revealed that the miktoarm copolymers were phase&#8208;separated in the bulk. The micro&#8208;Brownian motion of the A8B4 structure was markedly enhanced in the bulk due to a weak segregation interaction between the immiscible arms.

         <title>Thermally Activated Long Persistent Luminescence of Organic Inorganic Metal Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional afterglow of organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) is mostly attributed to the ultra&#8208;long phosphorescence. A new type of OIMH is demonstrated with long persistent luminescence (LPL) caused by the charge separation state. The stable LPL process is thermally activated and can be excited by low power standard LED light sources, offering potential in fire safety, information encryption, biological imaging and other fields.







Abstract
Long persistent luminescence (LPL) materials of SrAl2O4 doped with Eu2+ or Dy3+ can maintain emission over hours after ceasing the excitation but suffer from insolubility, high cost, and harsh preparation. Recently, organic LPL of guest&#8208;host exciplex systems has been demonstrated via an intermediate charge&#8208;separated state with flexible design but poor air&#8208;stability. Here, we synthesized a nontoxic two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic metal hybrid halides (OIMHs), called PBA2[ZnX4] with X=Br or Cl and PBA=4&#8208;phenylbenzylamine. These materials exhibit stable LPL emission over minutes at room&#8208;temperature, which is two orders of magnitude longer than those of previously reported OIMHs. The mechanism study shows that the LPL emission comes from thermally activated charge separation state rather than room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. Moreover, the LPL of PBA2[ZnX4] can be excited by low power sources, representing an effective strategy for developing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;stability LPL systems.

         <title>The COVID19&#8208;NMR Consortium: A Public Report on the Impact of this New Global Collaboration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Viewpoint Article discusses how the global NMR community organized itself to rapidly contribute to combat SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. This new collaborative research might serve as model for future ways to address great societal needs, without competing with curiosity&#8208;driven research.







Abstract
The outbreak of COVID&#8208;19 in December 2019 required the formation of international consortia for a coordinated scientific effort to understand and combat the virus. In this Viewpoint Article, we discuss how the NMR community has gathered to investigate the genome and proteome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and tested them for binding to low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight binders. External factors including extended lockdowns due to the global pandemic character of the viral infection triggered the transition from locally focused collaborative research conducted within individual research groups to digital exchange formats for immediate discussion of unpublished results and data analysis, sample sharing, and coordinated research between more than 50 groups from 18 countries simultaneously. We discuss key lessons that might pertain after the end of the pandemic and challenges that we need to address.

         <dc:description>
Supramolecular A8Bn miktoarm star copolymers were fabricated by host&#8211;guest complexation between a cavitand&#8208;based coordination capsule possessing eight polystyrene arms and biphenyl guest molecules with one, two, or four polymethyl acrylate arms, as reported by Takeharu Haino and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202219001). The stability of the A8B1, A8B2, and A8B4 miktoarm star polymers is influenced by the number of polymethyl acrylate arms of the guest polymers.

         <title>Back Cover: Enzymatic Electrosynthesis of Glycine from CO2 and NH3 (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 14/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic electrocatalytic system was developed that allows the simultaneous conversion of CO2 and NH3 for glycine synthesis, as reported by Zhiguang Zhu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202218387). This system was inspired by the reductive glycine pathway in&#8197;vivo and is based on an in&#8197;vitro multienzymatic cascade reaction, representing a novel alternative for enzymatic CO2 electroreduction for synthesizing nitrogenous value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Cover Picture: Multistate Structural Switching of [3]Catenanes with Cyclic Porphyrin Dimers by Complexation with Amine Ligands (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 14/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural switching of [3]catenane was induced by fitting the puzzle pieces. In their Research Article (202217002), Jun Terao et&#8197;al. report a method for ligand&#8208;controlled structural switching of [3]catenane, which was realized by the complexation of metal ions on [3]catenane with added complementarily fitted organic ligands, like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. The high tailorability of organic ligands offers multiple pieces with various sizes and numbers of coordination sites, enabling multistate structural switching of [3]catenane.

Carboranes. B9&#8208;functionalized carboranylphosphines with bulky electron&#8208;donating substituents display an extremely electron&#8208;releasing character, as reported by Evamarie Hey&#8208;Hawkins et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202218648). The compounds exert a high steric demand, which allows the mesityl derivatives to form stabilized phosphoniumyl radical cations.

A covalent organic framework (COF) anode with acid&#8211;alkaline co&#8208;tolerance, long cycle life, and high rate performance was developed for aqueous batteries. In their Research Article (e202218745), Haiyan Zhang, Chunyi Zhi, Haiming Lv et&#8197;al. designed the robust covalent linkage (&#8208;NH&#8208;) and the hydrogen bond network between &#8208;NH&#8208; and H2O, which collectively improve the chemical stability and promote the rapid conduction of H+/OH&#8722; by the Grotthuss mechanism. Thus the COF displays superior stability and rate performance.

         <title>Active Separation of Water Isotopologues by Local Molecular Motion in Microporous Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a recent study, Su et al. demonstrated the creation of dynamic pore windows in a porous coordination polymer based on ligand flipping. Adsorption experiments show that the dynamic pore windows favor kinetic adsorption of H2O over D2O for unprecedented water isotopologue separation selectivity.







Abstract
Around 10&#8211;15&#8201;% of the world's energy consumption is accounted for by the separation and purification of chemicals. Among them is the enrichment and separation of isotopologues which are an essential aspect of modern chemistry. In their recent work, Su et&#8197;al. demonstrate the separation of water isotopologues by responsive dynamic pore windows in a microporous coordination polymer with unprecedented selectivity based on an elegant mechanism.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Acidic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrochemical catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in acidic media is reviewed, with a focus on the mechanistic understanding of the active sites, elucidation of the structure&#8208;property relationships, the strategic improvement of the catalytic activity/durability, their applications in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, along with current challenges and future perspectives.







Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is vital for clean and renewable energy technologies, which require no fossil fuel but catalysts. Platinum (Pt) is the best&#8208;known catalyst for ORR. However, its high cost and scarcity have severely hindered renewable energy devices (e.g., fuel cells) for large&#8208;scale applications. Recent breakthroughs in carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrochemical catalysts (C&#8208;MFECs) show great potential for earth&#8208;abundant carbon materials as low&#8208;cost metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts towards ORR in acidic media. This article provides a focused, but critical review on C&#8208;MFECs for ORR in acidic media with an emphasis on advances in the structure design and synthesis, fundamental understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship and electrocatalytic mechanisms, and their applications in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Current challenges and future perspectives in this emerging field are also discussed.

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Crystalline Supramolecular Assemblies Built with Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the advancements in the field of macrocycle&#8208;based crystalline charge&#8208;transfer assemblies, including their preparation, structures, and diverse supramolecular functions and applications, such as vapochromic behavior and supramolecular tessellations, arising from the CT state. Future perspectives and challenges of this emerging research field are also presented.







Abstract
Synthetic macrocycles have served as principal tools for supramolecular chemistry, have greatly extended the scope of organic charge transfer (CT) complexes, and have proved to be of great practical value in the solid state during the past few years. In this Minireview, we summarize the research progress on the macrocycle&#8208;based crystalline supramolecular assemblies primarily driven by intermolecular CT interactions (a.k.a. macrocycle&#8208;based crystalline CT assemblies, MCCAs for short), which are classified by their donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) constituent elements, including simplex macrocyclic hosts, heterogeneous macrocyclic hosts, and host&#8211;guest D&#8208;A pairs. Particular attention will be focused on their diverse functions and applications, as well as the underlying CT mechanisms from the perspective of crystal engineering. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospects are outlined.

         <title>Beyond Microporosity in Porous Organic Molecular Materials (POMMs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The level of porosity beyond the microporous regime in Porous Organic Molecular Materials (POMMs) will trigger a shift in porous materials, rendering fascinating and unique opportunities in many applications. In this minireview, we summarize the recent advances in the synthesis of meso&#8208; and/or macroporous and hierarchical POMMs, highlighting some of their current applications.







Abstract
Porous organic molecular materials (POMMs) are a novel class of porous materials that cover a wide range of organic&#8208;based molecular building blocks connected through weak supramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. Despite of their diverse chemical and structural nature, common features to POMMs include solution processability, crystallinity and microporosity. Herein, we focus, for the first time, on the advance of the field of POMMs beyond the archetypical microporosity. In particular, we highlight relevant examples of meso&#8208; and macroporous POMMs, as well as hierchachical ones (micro&#8208;/meso&#8208;, micro&#8208;/macro&#8208; and meso&#8208;/macroporous). We also remark some of their unique properties, and how they can be key in many applications.

         <title>Third&#8208;Generation Sequencing of Epigenetic DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Third&#8208;generation sequencing platforms provide fast, convenient, and often inexpensive means of DNA sequencing; however, direct detection of epigenetic bases is yet to be routinely achieved. Here, derivatisation and labelling techniques that enable profiling of cytosine modifications on these platforms are reviewed.







Abstract
The discovery of epigenetic bases has revolutionised the understanding of disease and development. Among the most studied epigenetic marks are cytosines covalently modified at the 5 position. In order to gain insight into their biological significance, the ability to determine their spatiotemporal distribution within the genome is essential. Techniques for sequencing on &#8220;next&#8208;generation&#8221; platforms often involve harsh chemical treatments leading to sample degradation. Third&#8208;generation sequencing promises to further revolutionise the field by providing long reads, enabling coverage of highly repetitive regions of the genome or structural variants considered unmappable by next generation sequencing technology. While the ability of third&#8208;generation platforms to directly detect epigenetic modifications is continuously improving, at present chemical or enzymatic derivatisation presents the most convenient means of enhancing reliability. This Review presents techniques available for the detection of cytosine modifications on third&#8208;generation platforms.

         <title>Simple Ether&#8208;Directed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Borylation of Cyclopropanes Enabled by Iridium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple ether&#8208;directed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of cyclopropanes was accomplished by CBL/iridium catalysis for the first time. The reported method features tolerance of a broad range of functional groups (38 examples), excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee), and high turnover numbers (up to 335).







Abstract
Reported here is an efficient and simple ether&#8208;directed iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of cyclopropanes. Various functional groups were well&#8208;tolerated, affording a vast array of chiral cyclopropanes with high enantioselectivities. We also demonstrated that the turnover numbers of the current reaction could be up to 335.

         <title>Mechanism of Cations Suppressing Proton Diffusion Kinetics for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accumulating K+ cations break the water network connectivity, and confine protons in the cation hydration shell, thus slowing the proton diffusion kinetics.







Abstract
Proton transfer is crucial for electrocatalysis. Accumulating cations at electrochemical interfaces can alter the proton transfer rate and then tune electrocatalytic performance. However, the mechanism for regulating proton transfer remains ambiguous. Here, we quantify the cation effect on proton diffusion in solution by hydrogen evolution on microelectrodes, revealing the rate can be suppressed by more than 10 times. Different from the prevalent opinions that proton transport is slowed down by modified electric field, we found water structure imposes a more evident effect on kinetics. FTIR test and path integral molecular dynamics simulation indicate that proton prefers to wander within the hydration shell of cations rather than to hop rapidly along water wires. Low connectivity of water networks disrupted by cations corrupts the fast&#8208;moving path in bulk water. This study highlights the promising way for regulating proton kinetics via a modified water structure.

         <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Benzylamine Derivatives: Synthesis of a Precursor to Levocetirizine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deprotonation of N&#8242;&#8208;aryl urea derivatives with a chiral lithium amide base leads to an enantioselective C&#8208;arylation of benzylamines. An unusual stereoretentive substitution reaction followed by N&#8208;deprotection of the urea forms diarylmethylamine derivatives, including a synthetic intermediate en route to the drug levocetirizine.







Abstract
A practical, transition metal&#8208;free method allows the enantioselective synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diarylmethylamines by asymmetric &#945;&#8208;arylation of benzylamines. Enantioselective lithiation of N&#8242;&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N&#8208;isopropyl ureas using a chiral lithium amide base generates a benzyllithium that undergoes an unactivated stereospecific intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution to generate an &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diarylmethylamine in the form of its urea derivative, in up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee. Treatment with acid induces an &#8220;azatropic shift&#8221; with retention of configuration, the product of which may be hydrolysed to the target amine.

         <title>Carboxylic Acid Salts as Dual&#8208;Function Reagents for Carboxylation and Carbon Isotope Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potassium salt of triphenylacetic acid is developed as a combined source of CO2 and base/metalating agent. This method avoids specialized equipment and is used in the carboxylation of a range of compound classes. This provides a mechanistically distinct approach to carboxylation that has also been applied in carbon isotope labeling.







Abstract
The potassium salts of carboxylic acids are developed as efficient carboxylating agents through CO2 exchange. We describe these carboxylates as dual&#8208;function reagents because they function as a combined source of CO2 and base/metalating agent. By using the salt of a commercially available carboxylic acid, this protocol overcomes difficulties when using CO2 gas or organometallic reagents, such as pressurized containers or strictly inert conditions. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, does not require transition metals or other additives, and shows broad substrate scope. Through the preparation of several biologically important molecules, we show how this strategy provides an opportunity for isotope labeling with low equivalents of labeled CO2.

Highly efficient spiroborate&#8208;based host materials are developed for use in blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The C,N&#8208;chelate spiroborate skeleton embedding O and N atoms effectively suppresses charge trapping and achieves a maximum EQE of 27.6&#8201;% with narrowband deep blue emission.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) receive considerable attention because of their commercial use in flat panel displays. Herein, highly efficient spiroborate&#8208;based host materials are reported for use in blue OLEDs. Our designed spiroborates (SBOX) were simple to synthesize and exhibited high triplet excitation energies, narrow S&#8208;T gaps, and balanced charge carrier mobilities. A blue OLED containing one of the designed spiroborates, SBON, as a host exhibited a high external quantum efficiency (27.6&#8201;%) and low turn&#8208;on voltage (3.7&#8197;V) compared to those observed using 3,3&#8242;&#8208;di(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (17.6&#8201;% and 4.5&#8197;V, respectively), indicating their potential as host materials in OLEDs.

         <title>Development of a Non&#8208;Directed Petasis&#8208;Type Reaction by an Aromaticity&#8208;Disrupting Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Petasis&#8208;type coupling of &#945;&#8208;hydroxyindoles and trifluoroborate salts was accomplished. The combination of an aromaticity&#8208;disrupting iminium ion and preactivated trifluoroborate salts allowed for novel non&#8208;directed reactivity. The reaction's utility as a method for modifying complex molecules was featured with the facile preparation of dimers from bioactive molecule&#8208;derived monomers.







Abstract
The Petasis&#8208;type reaction, which couples an imine and boronic acid, is an important tool for C&#8722;C bond formation in organic synthesis. However, the generality of this transformation has been limited by the requirement for a directing heteroatom to enable reactivity. Herein, we report the development of a non&#8208;directed Petasis&#8208;type reaction that allows for the coupling of trifluoroborate salts with &#945;&#8208;hydroxyindoles. By disrupting aromaticity to generate a reactive iminium ion, in conjunction with using trifluoroborate nucleophiles, the method generates a new C&#8722;C bond without the need for a directing group. This reaction is operationally simple, providing &#945;&#8208;functionalized indoles in up to 99&#8201;% yield using sp, sp2, and sp3&#8208;hybridized trifluoroborate nucleophiles. Finally, this reaction is applied as a novel bioconjugation strategy to link biologically active molecules and toward the convergent synthesis of non&#8208;natural heterodimeric bisindole alkaloid analogs.

         <title>Akaike's Information Criterion for Stoichiometry Inference of Supramolecular Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>

An information&#8208;theoretic approach of Akaike's information criterion is introduced to infer the stoichiometry of host&#8211;guest complexes with weight of evidence for ranking. AIC may provide a versatile and superior method in place of the Job plot.







Abstract
&#8220;How do we decide the stoichiometry of host&#8211;guest complexes?&#8221; This question has long been answered by the Job plot since its first report in 1928. However, as the Job plot was claimed to be misleading in 2016, the question became an open question again and called for renewed investigations. An information&#8208;theoretic approach, called Akaike's information criterion, is introduced in this study to select the best model of host&#8211;guest complexes, which can rank the models with weight of evidence. A few test cases with unique cylindrical hosts were examined to demonstrate the applicability of the information&#8208;theoretic method. Consequently, reasonable views over the thermodynamic behaviors of dumbbell&#8208;and&#8208;cylinder complexes were obtained. Akaike's information criterion can be a useful and superior alternative to statistical null hypothesis testing, which was proposed as a remedy in place of the Job plot.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;free Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Module Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergence of the multi&#8208;module concept and solvent&#8208;free synthesis method has led to the synthesis of super&#8208;stable MOFs by a route free from additive, modulator, solvent, or activation. These MOFs combine the advantages of structural complexity and green chemistry and show good C2H2/CO2 separation performance.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;module design of framework materials with multiple distinct building blocks has attracted much attention because such materials are more amenable to compositional and geometrical tuning and thus offer more opportunities for property optimization. Few examples are known that use environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective solvent&#8208;free method to synthesize such materials. Here, we report the use of solvent&#8208;free method (also modulator&#8208;free) to synthesize a series of multi&#8208;module MOFs with high stability and separation property for C2H2/CO2. The synthesis only requires simple mixing of reactants and short reaction time (2&#8197;h). Highly porous and stable materials can be made without any post&#8208;synthetic activation. The success of solvent&#8208;free synthesis of multi&#8208;module MOFs reflects the synergy between different modules, resulting in stable pore&#8208;partitioned materials, despite the fact that other competitive crystallization pathways with simpler framework compositions also exist.

         <title>A Transformable and Bulky Methacrylate Monomer That Enables the Synthesis of an MMA&#8208;nBA Alternating Copolymer: Sequence&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Healing Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bulky and transformable methacrylate monomer was designed for the synthesis of a methyl methacrylate (MMA)&#8208;n&#8208;butyl acrylate (nBA) alternating copolymer. The keys to this achievement are the introduction of the adamantyl group to suppress homopolymerization of the MMA monomer and the transesterification for the selective and quantitative transformation into methyl ester pendants. The alternating copolymer exhibited superior self&#8208;healing properties compared to the statistical copolymer.







Abstract
In this study, we designed a methacrylate molecule with an alkyl&#8208;substituted trichloro salicylic acid pendant as a transformable bulky monomer to enable the synthesis of an alternating copolymer of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and n&#8208;butyl acrylate (nBA). The adamantyl&#8208;substituted methacrylate monomer (1&#8208;Ad) showed very low homopolymerization propensity in radical polymerizations, but afforded the alternating copolymer with nBA via copolymerization. The 1&#8208;Ad units in the resultant copolymer were quantitatively and selectively transformed into MMA via transesterification with methanol to yield the alternating copolymer of MMA and nBA. Its alternating sequence was clearly demonstrated by a structural analysis via 13C NMR spectroscopy as well as the low reactivity ratios for the 1&#8208;Ad and nBA pair. Finally, we verified the superior self&#8208;healing ability of the alternating copolymer compared to that of the corresponding 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 statistical copolymer.

         <dc:description>
Hexabenzoperihexacene (HBPH) with two incorporated octacene moieties has been synthesized. The two enantiomers of HPPH showed circular dichroism in the visible to NIR regions as well as an emission maximum at 798&#8197;nm with an absolute PLQY of 41&#8201;%. Analysis of the excited&#8208;state photophysical properties revealed an intriguing feature that was attributed to the rotational and/or conformational dynamics of HBPH after excitation.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a hexabenzoperihexacene (HBPH) with two incorporated octacene substructures, which was unambiguously characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The theoretical isomerization barrier of the (P,P)&#8208;/(P,M)&#8208;forms was estimated to be 38.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and resolution was achieved by chiral HPLC. Notably, the enantiomers exhibited opposite circular dichroism responses up to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (830&#8197;nm) with a high gabs value of 0.017 at 616&#8197;nm. Moreover, HBPH demonstrated NIR emission with a maximum at 798&#8197;nm and an absolute PLQY of 41&#8201;%. The excited&#8208;state photophysical properties of HBPH were investigated by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, revealing an intriguing feature that was attributed to the rotational and/or conformational dynamics of HBPH after excitation. These results provide new insight into the design of chiral nanographene with NIR optical properties for potential chiroptical applications.

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for the 2e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction by a 2e&#8722; pathway has been achieved using two one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The imine linkages led to higher activity and selectivity than two&#8208;dimensional COFs, without the need to introduce other heteroatoms.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are often employed for electrocatalytic systems because of their structural diversity. However, the efficiency of atom utilization is still in need of improvement, because the catalytic centers are located in the basal layers and it is difficult for the electrolytes to access them. Herein, we demonstrate the use of 1D COFs for the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The use of different four&#8208;connectivity blocks resulted in the prepared 1D COFs displaying good crystallinity, high surface areas, and excellent chemical stability. The more exposed catalytic sites resulted in the 1D COFs showing large electrochemically active surface areas, 4.8&#8208;fold of that of a control 2D COF, and thus enabled catalysis of the ORR with a higher H2O2 selectivity of 85.8&#8201;% and activity, with a TOF value of 0.051&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;V, than a 2D COF (72.9&#8201;% and 0.032&#8197;s&#8722;1). This work paves the way for the development of COFs with low dimensions for electrocatalysis.

     alt="One-Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for the 2e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction by a 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; pathway has been achieved using two one-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The imine linkages led to higher activity and selectivity than two-dimensional COFs, without the need to introduce other heteroatoms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are often employed for electrocatalytic systems because of their structural diversity. However, the efficiency of atom utilization is still in need of improvement, because the catalytic centers are located in the basal layers and it is difficult for the electrolytes to access them. Herein, we demonstrate the use of 1D COFs for the 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The use of different four-connectivity blocks resulted in the prepared 1D COFs displaying good crystallinity, high surface areas, and excellent chemical stability. The more exposed catalytic sites resulted in the 1D COFs showing large electrochemically active surface areas, 4.8-fold of that of a control 2D COF, and thus enabled catalysis of the ORR with a higher H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 85.8&#8201;% and activity, with a TOF value of 0.051&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2&#8197;V, than a 2D COF (72.9&#8201;% and 0.032&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work paves the way for the development of COFs with low dimensions for electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
