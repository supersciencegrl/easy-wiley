      <title>Targeted Degradation of Transcription Co&#8208;activator SRC&#8208;1 through the N&#8208;Degron Pathway</title>
      <dc:description>Aberrantly elevated steroid receptor co&#8208;activator&#8208;1 (SRC&#8208;1) expression and activity are strongly correlated with cancer progression and metastasis. Here we report, for the first time, the development of a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) that is composed of a selective SRC&#8208;1 binder linked to a specific ligand for UBR box, a unique class of E3 ligases recognizing N&#8208;degrons. We showed that the bifunctional molecule efficiently and selectively induced the degradation of SRC&#8208;1 in cells through the N&#8208;degron pathway. Importantly, given the ubiquitous expression of the UBR protein in most cells, PROTACs targeting the UBR box could degrade a protein of interest regardless of cell types. We also showed that the SRC&#8208;1 degrader significantly suppressed cancer cell invasion and migration  in vitro  and  in vivo  . Together, these results demonstrate that the SRC&#8208;1 degrader can be an invaluable chemical tool in the studies of SRC&#8208;1 functions. Moreover, our findings suggest PROTACs based on the N&#8208;degron pathway as a widely useful strategy to degrade disease&#8208;relevant proteins.</dc:description>

      <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Coordination to Surface Copper Sites in Selective Semihydrogenation Catalysts from Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Supported metal nanoparticles correspond to a very large class of heterogeneous catalysts. While detailed structure&#8208;activity relationships would require a molecular&#8208;level description of the interactions between the metal surfaces and ligands/substrates, this description is rarely accessible. Thus, most insights are often derived from model systems based on single crystals. With the goal to understand efficient alkyne semihydrogenation catalysts based on Cu functionalized with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC), we cross this gap by investigating NHC&#8208;stabilized molecular complexes, supported single sites and nanoparticles via solid&#8208;state NMR combined with computations. We demonstrate that, in silica&#8208;supported Cu single sites, Cu retains the coordination geometry observed in molecular compounds, as evidenced by the measured and computed&#160;dipole&#8208;quadrupole cross&#8208;term&#160;interaction at the carbenic carbon bound to Cu. We show that, for supported Cu nanoparticles, which are highly active and selective for the semihydrogenation of alkynes, NHC binding is favored at Cu adatoms atop of copper surface, thus paralleling what has been inferred by surface science studies on single crystals.</dc:description>

      <title>Stable Ti3+ defects in oriented mesoporous titania frameworks for efficient photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Black TiO  2  has attracted great scientific attention owing to its outstanding photoelectronic properties. However, the introduction of tunable defects into TiO  2  mesostructures still remain quite infertile, mainly ascribed to the difficulties in rationally incorporating Ti  3+  defects. Herein, by introducing a compatible reducing agent (2&#8208;ethylimidazole) into mono&#8208;micelle assembly process, we present a type of ordered mesoporous TiO  2  microspheres which combines radially aligned mesostructure with Ti  3+  defects in mesoporous frameworks. Notably, such reductant acts as a building block of mesostructured frameworks and in&#8208;situ reduce Ti  4+  to generate defects during calcination, giving rise to the coexistence of bulk Ti  3+  defects and ordered mesostructure. The obtained mesoporous TiO  2  possesses both excellent mesoporosity (a high surface area of 106 m  2  g  &#8208;1  , a mean pore size of 18.4 nm) and stable defects with extended photoresponse. Such integration of unique mesoscopic architecture and atomic vacancies provide both effective mass transportation and enhanced light utilization, leading to a remarkable increase in H  2  generation rate. A maximum H  2  evolution rate of 19.8 mmol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  can be achieved, along with outstanding stability under solar light, which is superior to the previous TiO  2  &#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Boosted Tc of 166 K in superconducting D3S synthesized from elemental sulfur and hydrogen</title>
      <dc:description>The discovery of superconductivity in H3S at 203 K marked an advance towards room&#8208;temperature superconductivity and demonstrated the enormous potential of H&#8208;dominated compounds to possess high critical temperatures (Tcs). There have been numerous reports of the H&#8208;S system over the last five years; nevertheless, important questions remain unanswered. In particular, it is crucial to verify whether the Tc was determined correctly for samples prepared from compressed H2S, since they are inevitably contaminated with H&#8208;depleted byproducts. In the present study, we prepare stoichiometric H3S by direct in situ synthesis from elemental S and excess H2. We reveal that the Im&#8208;3m phase of D3S samples exhibits Tcs that are significantly higher than previously reported values (~150 K), reaching a maximum Tc of 166 K at 157 GPa. Furthermore, we confirm that the sharp decrease in Tc below 150 GPa is accompanied by continuous rhombohedral structural distortions and demonstrate that the Cccm phase is non&#8208;metallic, with molecular H2 units in the crystal structure.</dc:description>

In particular, it is crucial to verify whether the Tc was determined correctly for samples prepared from compressed H2S, since they are inevitably contaminated with H&#8208;depleted byproducts. In the present study, we prepare stoichiometric H3S by direct in situ synthesis from elemental S and excess H2. We reveal that the Im&#8208;3m phase of D3S samples exhibits Tcs that are significantly higher than previously reported values (~150 K), reaching a maximum Tc of 166 K at 157 GPa. Furthermore, we confirm that the sharp decrease in Tc below 150 GPa is accompanied by continuous rhombohedral structural distortions and demonstrate that the Cccm phase is non&#8208;metallic, with molecular H2 units in the crystal structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Stretchable Electrochemical Sensors for Cell and Tissue Detection</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical sensing based on conventional rigid electrodes has large restriction on characterizing the biomolecules of deformed cells or soft tissues. The recent emergence of stretchable sensors allows them to conformally contact to curved surface and perfectly comply with the deformation of living cells and tissues. This provides a powerful strategy to monitor biomolecules from mechanically deformed cells, tissues and organisms in real time, and opens up new opportunities to explore the mechanotransduction process. In this minireview, we first summarize the fabrication of stretchable electrodes with emphasis on the nanomaterial&#8208;enabled strategies. We then describe representative applications of stretchable sensor in real&#8208;time monitoring of mechanically&#8208;sensitive cells and tissues. Finally, we present the future possibilities and challenges of stretchable electrochemical sensing in cell, tissue and in vivo detection.</dc:description>

      <title>Planting repulsion centers for faster ionic diffusion in superionic conductors</title>
      <dc:description>The successful launch of solid&#8208;state batteries relies on the discovery of solid electrolytes with remarkably high ionic conductivity. Extensive efforts have identified several important superionic conductors (SICs) and broadened our understanding of their superionic conductivity. Herein, we propose a new design strategy to facilitate ionic conduction in SICs by planting immobile repulsion centers. Our  ab&#8208;initio  molecular dynamics simulations on the model system Na  11  Sn  2  PS  12  demonstrate that the sodium ionic conductivity can be increased by approximately one order of magnitude by simply doping large Cs ions as repulsion centers in the characteristic vacant site of Na  11  Sn  2  PS  12  . We find that planting immobile repulsion centers locally induces the formation of high&#8208;energy sites, leading to a &#8220;fast track&#8221; for ionic conduction owing to the unique interactions among mobile ions in SICs.

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclopropanone Equivalents and Application to the Formation of Chiral &#946;&#8208;Lactams</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclopropanone derivatives have long been considered unsustainable synthetic intermediates due to their extreme strain and kinetic instability. Herein, we report the enantioselective synthesis of 1&#8208;sulfonylcyclopropanols as stable yet powerful equivalents of the corresponding cyclopropanone derivatives, via &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of sulfonylcyclopropanes using a bis(silyl) peroxide as electrophilic oxygen source.

Both the electronic and steric nature of the sulfonyl moiety, which serves as a base&#8208;labile protecting group and confers crystallinity to these cyclopropanone precursors, were found to have a crucial impact on the rate of equilibration to the corresponding cyclopropanone, highlighting their modular nature and the potential for their widespread adoption as synthetic intermediates. The utility of these cyclopropanone surrogates is demonstrated in a mild and stereospecific formal [3+1] cycloaddition with simple hydroxylamines acting here as nitrene equivalents, leading to the efficient formation of chiral &#946;&#8208;lactam derivatives.</dc:description>

Here, we report on a mechanism that enables a one&#8208;dimensional conductance structure by connecting discrete molecular states at 2.1eV through the pores of a metal&#8208;organic network on Cu(110). Two adjacent, periodic and isoenergetic contributions, namely a molecular resonance and the confined surface&#8208;state, add&#8208;up leading to anisotropic structures, as channels, observable in real&#8208;space conductance images.

      <title>Aptamers with tunable affinity enable single&#8208;molecule tracking and localization of membrane receptors on living cancer cells</title>
      <dc:description>Tumor cell&#8208;surface markers are usually overexpressed&#160; or mutated&#160; protein receptors for which spatiotemporal regulation differs between and within cancers. Single&#8208;molecule fluorescence imaging can profile individual markers in different cellular contexts with molecular precision. However, standard single&#8208;molecule imaging methods based on overexpressed genetically&#8208;encoded tags or cumbersome probes can significantly alter the native state of receptors. Here we introduce a live&#8208;cell Points Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (PAINT) method that exploits aptamers as minimally invasive affinity probes. Localization and tracking of individual receptors are based on stochastic and transient binding between aptamers and their targets. We demonstrated single&#8208;molecule imaging of a model tumor marker (EGFR) on a panel of living cancer cells. Affinity to EGFR was finely tuned by rational engineering of aptamer sequences to&#160; define&#160; receptor motion and/or native receptor density.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tumor cell&#8208;surface markers are usually overexpressed&#160; or mutated&#160; protein receptors for which spatiotemporal regulation differs between and within cancers. Single&#8208;molecule fluorescence imaging can profile individual markers in different cellular contexts with molecular precision. However, standard single&#8208;molecule imaging methods based on overexpressed genetically&#8208;encoded tags or cumbersome probes can significantly alter the native state of receptors. Here we introduce a live&#8208;cell Points Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (PAINT) method that exploits aptamers as minimally invasive affinity probes. Localization and tracking of individual receptors are based on stochastic and transient binding between aptamers and their targets. We demonstrated single&#8208;molecule imaging of a model tumor marker (EGFR) on a panel of living cancer cells. Affinity to EGFR was finely tuned by rational engineering of aptamer sequences to&#160; define&#160; receptor motion and/or native receptor density.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Inverse Vulcanization of Styrylethyltrimethoxysilane &#8211; Coated Surfaces, Particles and Crosslinked Materials</title>

      <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction on CuOx Nanocubes Tracking the Evolution of Chemical State, Geometric Structure, and Catalytic Selectivity using Operando Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The direct electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) into multi&#8208;carbon (C  2+  ) products still faces fundamental and technological challenges. While facet&#8208;controlled and oxide&#8208;derived Cu materials have been touted as promising catalysts, their stability has remained problematic and poorly understood. The present work uncovers changes in the chemical and morphological state of supported and unsupported Cu  2  O nanocubes during operation in low&#8208;current H&#8208;Cells and in high&#8208;current Gas Diffusion Electrodes (GDEs) using neutral pH buffer conditions. While unsupported nanocubes achieved a sustained C  2+  faradaic efficiency of around 60% for 40 h, the dispersion on a carbon support sharply shifted the selectivity pattern towards C  1  products. O  perando  XAS and time&#8208;resolved electron microscopy revealed the degradation of the cubic shape and, in the presence of a carbon support, the formation of small Cu&#8208;seeds during the surprisingly slow reduction of bulk Cu  2  O. Here, the initially (100)&#8208;rich facet structure has presumably no controlling role on the catalytic selectivity, whereas the oxide&#8208;derived generation of under&#8208;coordinated lattice defects, as revealed by the  operando  Cu&#8208;Cu coordination numbers, can support the high C  2+  product yields.</dc:description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Electrofreezing of Super Cooled Water on Surfaces of Pyroelectric Crystals is Trigered by Planar&#8208;Trigonal Ions</title>
      <dc:description>Electrofreezing experiments of super&#8208;cooled water (SCW) with different ions, performed directly on the charged hemihedral faces of pyroelectric LiTaO  3  and AgI crystals, in the presence and in the absence of pyroelectric charge are reported. It is demonstrated that bicarbonate (HCO  3   &#8315;   ) ions elevate the icing temperature near the positively charged faces. In contrast, the hydronium (H  3  O   &#8314;   ), slightly reduces the icing temperature. Molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the hydrated planar&#8208;trigonal HCO  3   &#8315; ions   self&#8208;assemble with water molecules near the surface of the AgI crystal as clusters of slightly different configuration from those of the ice&#8208;like hexagons. These clusters, however, have a tendency to serve as embryonic nuclei for ice crystallization. Consequently, we predicted and experimentally confirmed that the planar trigonal ions of NO  3   &#8315;   and guanidinium (Gdm   &#8314;   ) elevate the icing temperature near the positive and negative charged surfaces, respectively. On the other hand, the Cl   &#8315;   and SO  4  2   &#8315;   ions of different configurations   reduce the icing temperature.</dc:description>

      <title>Pressure&#8208;Suppressed Carrier Trapping Leads to Enhanced Emission in Two&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite (HA)2(GA)Pb2I7</title>
      <dc:description>Lattice compression through hydrostatic pressure is an effective way to tune the structural and optical properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halide perovskites &#8208; a new class of emerging materials for photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting applications. However, few examples exhibit improved photoluminescence (PL) performance of 2D perovskites upon compression. It also remains unclear how the pressure&#8208;induced structural changes affect carrier trapping, which is critical for the optoelectronic properties of halide perovskites. Here, we show a remarkable PL enhancement by 12 folds using pressure to modulate the structure of a recently developed 2D perovskite (HA)2(GA)Pb2I7  (HA =  n&#8208;hexylammonium, GA = guanidinium). This structure features an extremely large cage previously unattainable, affording us a rare opportunity to understand the structure&#8208;property relationship and explore emergent phenomena in halide perovskites.  In situ  structural, spectroscopic, and theoretical analyses reveal that lattice compression under a mild pressure within 1.6 GPa considerably suppresses the carrier trapping, leading to significantly enhanced emission. Further pressurization induces a non&#8208;luminescent amorphous yellow phase, which, surprisingly, is retained and exhibits a continuously increasing bandgap during decompression. When the pressure is released to 1.5 GPa, intriguingly, emission can be triggered by above&#8208;bandgap laser irradiation, accompanied by a color change from yellow to orange. The obtained orange phase could be retained at ambient conditions and exhibits two&#8208;fold higher PL emission compared with the pristine (HA)2(GA)Pb2I7. Our findings not only reveal extraordinary pressure&#8208;induced variations and their underlying mechanisms in 2D halide perovskites but also demonstrate the formation of a new phase with enhanced properties at ambient conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Atomic Imaging of Subsurface Interstitial Hydrogen and Insights into Surface Reactivity of Palladium Hydrides</title>
      <dc:description>Resolving interstitial hydrogen atoms at the surfaces and interfaces is crucial for understanding the mechanical and physicochemical properties of metal hydrides. Although palladium (Pd) hydrides hold important applications in hydrogen storage and electrocatalysis, the atomic position of interstitial hydrogen at Pd hydride near surfaces still remains undetermined.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Resolving interstitial hydrogen atoms at the surfaces and interfaces is crucial for understanding the mechanical and physicochemical properties of metal hydrides. Although palladium (Pd) hydrides hold important applications in hydrogen storage and electrocatalysis, the atomic position of interstitial hydrogen at Pd hydride near surfaces still remains undetermined. We report here the first direct imaging of subsurface hydrogen atoms absorbed in Pd nanoparticles by using differentiated and integrated differential phase contrast within aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. In contrast to the well&#8208;established octahedral interstitial sites for hydrogen in the bulk, subsurface hydrogen atoms are directly identified to occupy the tetrahedral interstices.

      <title>Sunflower Trypsin Inhibitor&#8208;1 (SFTI&#8208;1): Sowing Seeds in the Fields of Chemistry and Biology</title>
      <dc:description>Nature&#8208;derived cyclic peptides have proven to be a vast source of inspiration for advancing modern pharmaceutical design and synthetic chemistry. The focus of this review is sunflower trypsin inhibitor&#8208;1 (SFTI&#8208;1), one of the smallest disulfide&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides found in nature. SFTI&#8208;1 has an unusual biosynthetic pathway that begins with a dual&#8208;purpose albumin precursor and ends with the production of a high affinity serine protease inhibitor that rivals other inhibitors much larger in size. Investigating the molecular basis for SFTI&#8208;1&#8217;s rigid structure and adaptable function has planted seeds for thought that have now blossomed in several different fields. Here we survey these applications to highlight the growing potential of SFTI&#8208;1 as a versatile template for inhibitor engineering, a prototypic peptide for studying inhibitory mechanisms, a stable scaffold for grafting bioactive peptides, and a model peptide for evaluating peptidomimetic motifs and platform technologies.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering Platinum&#8208;Oxygen Dual Catalytic Sites via Charge Transfer towards High&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Dual&#8208;site catalyst allows for a synergetic reaction in the close proximity to enhance catalysis. It is highly desirable to create dual&#8208;site interfaces in single&#8208;atom system in order to maximize the effect. Herein, we report a cation&#8208;deficient electrostatic anchorage route to fabricate an atomically dispersed platinum&#8208;titania catalyst (Pt  1  O1  /Ti  1&#8208;x  O  2  ), which shows greatly enhanced hydrogen evolution activity, surpassing that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst in mass by a factor of 53.2.  Operando  techniques and density functional theory calculations reveal that Pt  1  O1  /Ti  1&#8208;x  O  2  experiences a Pt&#8208;O dual&#8208;site catalytic pathway, where the inherent charge transfer within the dual sites encourages the jointly coupling protons and plays the key role during the Volmer&#8208;Tafel process. There is almost no decay in the activity of Pt  1  O1  /Ti  1&#8208;x  O  2  over 300,000 cycles, meaning 30 times of enhancement in stability compared to the commercial Pt/C catalysts (10,000 cycles).</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Here an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of azide&#8208;ynamides via &#945;&#8208;imino copper carbene intermediates is reported, which represents the first generation of &#945;&#8208;imino copper carbenes from alkynes.

Moreover, such an asymmetric azide&#8208;ynamide cyclization has been achieved with high enantioselectivities (up to 98:2 e.r.) by employing BOX&#8208;Cu complexes as chiral catalysts.

      <dc:description>1,4&#8208;Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (dabco) and its derivatives have been extensively utilized as building units of excellent molecular ferroelectrics for decades. However, the homochiral dabco&#8208;based ferroelectric remains a blank.

The two enantiomers show two sequential phase transitions with transition temperature (Tc) as high as 405.8 K and 415.8 K, which is outstanding in both dabco&#8208;based ferroelectrics and homochiral ferroelectrics. To our knowledge, [R and S&#8208;2&#8208;Me&#8208;H2dabco][TFSA]2 are the first examples of dabco&#8208;based homochiral ferroelectrics.

      <title>Ligand Regulated Regiodivergent Hydrosilylation of Isoprene under Iron Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>A regiodivergent and stereoselective hydrosilylation of basic industrial feedstock isoprene with unactivated silanes has been developed using earth&#8208;abundant iron catalyst. The manipulation of regioselectivity relies on fine modification of the coordination geometry of iron center. While a bidentate pyridine imine ligand promotes the formation of allylic silanes via a 4,1&#8208;addition, the selectivity toward 3,4&#8208;adduct homoallylic silanes was achieved by switching to tridentate nitrogen ligand. Experimental studies and analysis have been performed to interpret the mechanism and the regioselective manipulation. This work contributes to the art of regioselective control in alkene hydrofunctionalization.</dc:description>

      <title>A Modular Approach to Dibenzo&#8208;fused &#949;&#8208;Lactams: Palladium Carbene Bridging C&#8208;H Activation and Its Synthetic Application</title>

      <title>Natural Soft/Rigid Superlattice as Anodes for High Performance Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The volume expansion and poor conductivity are two major obstacles that hinder the pursuing for the lithium&#8208;ion batteries with long cycling life and high power density. Herein, we highlight a misfit compound PbNbS  3  with soft/rigid superlattice structure, which was unambiguously confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy and electrochemical characterization, as a promising anode material for high performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries with simultaneously optimized capacity, stability and conductivity. In this model, the soft PbS sublayers primarily react with lithium, endow the capacity and prevent the decompositon of the superlattice structure, while the rigid NbS  2  sublayers support the skeleton and enhances the migration of electrons and lithium ions, as a result synergistically leading to a specific capacity of 710 mAh g  &#8722;1  at 100 mA g  &#8722;1  which is 1.6 times of NbS  2  and 3.9 times of PbS.

      <title>Outer Membrane Protease (OmpT)&#8208;based E. coli Sensing with Anionic Polythiophene and Unlabeled Peptide Substrate</title>
      <dc:description>E. coli  and  Salmonella  are two of the most common bacterial pathogens involved in food and water borne related deaths. Hence, it is critical to develop rapid and sensitive detection strategies for near outbreak applications. We report a simple and specific assay to detect as low as 1 CFU/mL of  E. coli  in water within 6 hours by targeting the bacteria&#8217;s surface protease activity. The assay relies on polythiophene acetic acid (PTAA) as optical reporter and a short unlabeled peptide (LL37  FRRV  ) previously optimized as substrate for OmpT, an outer membrane protease on  E. coli  . LL37  FRRV  interacts with PTAA to enhance its fluorescence while also inducing the formation of a helical PTAA&#8208;LL37  FRRV  construct, as confirmed by Circular Dichroism. However, in the presence of  E. coli  , LL37  FRRV  is cleaved and can no longer affect PTAA&#8217;s conformation and optical properties. This ability to distinguish between intact and cleaved peptide was investigated in detail using LL37  FRRV  sequence variants.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering Sensitized Photon Upconversion Efficiency via Nanocrystal Wavefunction and Molecular Geometry</title>
      <dc:description>Triplet energy transfer from inorganic nanocrystals to molecular acceptors has attracted strong attention as a promising approach to high&#8208;efficiency photon upconversion that is important for energy&#8208;related applications. Because energy transfer is a donor&#8208;acceptor interfacial process, it is essential to simultaneously engineer the nanocrystal and molecular parameters in order to uncover unified physical principles that are transferable among different systems. Here we study this problem using CsPbBr  3  and CdSe nanocrystals as triplet donors and carboxylated anthracene isomers as acceptors. We find that the position of the carboxyl anchoring group on the molecule dictates the donor&#8208;acceptor coupling to be either &#8220;through&#8208;bond&#8221; or &#8220;through&#8208;space&#8221;, while the relative strengths of the two coupling pathways is controlled by the &#8220;wavefunction&#8208;leakage&#8221; of nanocrystals that can be quantitatively tuned by nanocrystal sizes or shell thicknesses. By simultaneously engineering molecular geometry and nanocrystal wavefunction, energy transfer and photon upconversion efficiencies of a nanocrystal/molecule system can be improved by orders of magnitude.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Single and double cyclophenylene&#8208;ethynylenes (CPEs) with axial and helical chirality have been synthesized by the Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling of di&#8208; and tetra&#8208;ethynyl biphenyls with a U&#8208;shaped prearomatic diiodoparaphenylene followed by reductive aromatization.

In both the single and double CPEs, orbital interactions along the biphenyl axis were observed by DFT calculations in LUMO and LUMO+2 of the single CPE and LUMO+1 of the double CPE, which were likely to cause the lowering of these orbital energies.

      <title>Rational Control of Charge Transfer Excitons Toward High&#8208;Contrast Reversible Mechanoresponsive Luminescent Switching: Magic of a Volatile Third Party in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>Realizing mechanochromism in rigid molecular systems is very important and highly desirable to broaden their potential applications. Here, a novel and practicable strategy to rationally obtain the reversible mechanochromic luminescent (MCL) material with high&#8208;contrast ratio (green versus red) has been established. Namely, by introducing a volatile third party (small&#8208;sized solvent molecules) into the lattice of charge transfer (CT) cocrystal of mixed&#8208;stacking 1:1 coronene (Cor.) and napthalenetetracarboxylic diimide (NDI), a noteworthy reconfigurable molecular assembly is ingeniously achieved due to the loosely packing arrangement as well as weakened intermolecular interactions. Accordingly, the CT excited state, strongly corresponding to the molecular stacking modes, can be intentionally tailored through external stimulus (i.e. heating, grinding, or solvent), accompanying with distinct changes in photophysical properties. Subsequently, a high&#8208;contrast reversible MCL with highly sensitive and good reproducibility is realized and the underlying mechanism is thoroughly revealed.</dc:description>

      <title>Coordination of Actinide Single Ions with Deformed Graphdiyne: Strategy on Essential Separation Processes in Nuclear Fuel Cycle</title>
      <dc:description>The coordination of actinides, lanthanides, as well as strontium and cesium with graphdiyne (GDY) was studied by experiments and theoretical calculations. On the basis of experimental results and/or theoretical calculations, it was suggested that Th  4+  , Pu  4+  , Am  3+  , Cm  3+  and Cs  +  exist in single ion states on the special triangle structure of GDY with various coordination patterns, in which GDY itself is deformed in different manners. Both experiments and theoretical calculations strongly support that UO  2  2+  , La  3+  , Eu  3+  , Tm  3+  and Sr  2+  are not adsorbed by GDY at all. The distinguished adsorption behaviors of GDY afford an important strategy for highly selective separation between actinides and lanthanides, Th  4+  and UO  2  2+  ,  Cs  +  and Sr  2+  in nuclear fuel cycle. Also, the present work sheds light on an approach to explore the unique functions and physicochemical properties of actinides in single ion states.</dc:description>

      <title>A Divergent Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Post&#8208;Iboga Indole Alkaloids</title>
      <dc:description>Divergent enantioselective total syntheses of five naturally occurring post&#8208;iboga indole alkaloids, dippinine B ( 3  ) and C ( 4  ), 10,11&#8208;demethoxychippiine ( 8  ), 3&#8208; O  &#8208;methyl&#8208;10,11&#8208;demethoxychippiine ( 9  ), and 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,4&#8208;secocoronaridine ( 11  ), and two analogues 11&#8208;demethoxydippinine A ( 2  ) and D ( 6  ), were presented for the first time. The enantioenriched aza[3.3.1]&#8208;bridged cycle, common core intermediate to the target molecules, was constructed through an asymmetric phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalyzed Michael/aldol cascade reaction. The challenging azepane ring fused around the indole ring and the [3.3.1]&#8208;bridged cycle was installed via an intromolecular S N  2&#8217;&#8211;type reaction. These cyclization strategies allowed for a rapid construction of the [6.5.6.6.7]&#8208;pentacyclic core at an early stage. The late stage syntheses were highlighted by a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Stille coupling and a catalyst&#8208;controlled highly stereoselective hydrogenation to incorporate the side chain at C 20  with both R  and S  conformations in the natural products.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Divergent enantioselective total syntheses of five naturally occurring post&#8208;iboga indole alkaloids, dippinine B ( 3  ) and C ( 4  ), 10,11&#8208;demethoxychippiine ( 8  ), 3&#8208; O  &#8208;methyl&#8208;10,11&#8208;demethoxychippiine ( 9  ), and 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,4&#8208;secocoronaridine ( 11  ), and two analogues 11&#8208;demethoxydippinine A ( 2  ) and D ( 6  ), were presented for the first time. The enantioenriched aza[3.3.1]&#8208;bridged cycle, common core intermediate to the target molecules, was constructed through an asymmetric phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalyzed Michael/aldol cascade reaction. The challenging azepane ring fused around the indole ring and the [3.3.1]&#8208;bridged cycle was installed via an intromolecular S N  2&#8217;&#8211;type reaction. These cyclization strategies allowed for a rapid construction of the [6.5.6.6.7]&#8208;pentacyclic core at an early stage. The late stage syntheses were highlighted by a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Stille coupling and a catalyst&#8208;controlled highly stereoselective hydrogenation to incorporate the side chain at C 20  with both R  and S  conformations in the natural products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Periodically Ordered, Nuclease&#8208;Resistant DNA Nanowires Decorated with Cell&#8208;Specific Aptamers as Selective Theranostic Agents</title>
      <dc:description>DNA nanostructures have shown potentials in cancer therapy. However, current clinical practice is hampered by the difficulty to deliver them into cancer cells and susceptibility to nuclease degradation. To overcome these limitations, we report herein a periodically&#8208;ordered nick&#8208;hidden DNA nanowire (NW) with high serum stability and active targeting functionality. The inner core is made of multiple&#8208;connected DNA double helices and the outer shell is composed of regularly&#8208;arranged standing&#8208;up hairpin aptamers. All terminals of the components are hidden from nuclease attacks while the target&#8208;binding sites are exposed to allow delivery to the cancer target. The DNA NW remains intact over 24&#8208;h incubation in serum solution. Animal imaging and cell apoptosis show that the anticancer drugs formulated NW displays long blood&#8208;circulation time and high specificity in inducing cancer cell apoptosis. Treatment of tumor&#8208;bearing mice validates  in vivo  therapeutic efficacy, demonstrating an ideal theranostic vehicle for targeted imaging and therapy of cancers.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrogenase mimics in M12L24 nano&#8208;spheres to control overpotential and activity in proton reduction catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogenase enzymes are excellent proton reduction catalysts and therefore provide clear blueprints for the development of nature inspired synthetic analogs. Mimicking their catalytic center is straightforward but mimicking the protein matrix around the active site and all its functions remains challenging. Synthetic models lack this precisely controlled second coordination sphere that provides substrate preorganization and catalyst stability and, as a result, their performances are far from those of the natural enzyme. In this contribution we report a strategy to easily introduce a specific yet customizable second coordination sphere around synthetic hydrogenase models by encapsulation inside M  12  L  24  cages and at the same time create a proton&#8208;rich nano&#8208;environment by co&#8208;encapsulation of ammonium salts, effectively providing substrate preorganization and intermediates stabilization. We show that catalyst encapsulation in these nano&#8208;cages reduces the catalytic overpotential for proton reduction by 250 mV as compared to the uncaged catalyst while the proton&#8208;rich nano&#8208;environment created around the catalyst ensures that high catalytic rates are maintained.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Histone deacetylase (HDAC) is a major class of deacetylation enzymes. Many HDACs exist in large protein complexes in cells and their functions strongly depend on the complex composition. The identification of HDAC&#8208;associated proteins is highly important in understanding their molecular mechanisms.

We report a DNA&#8208;based affinity labeling method capable of presenting different probe configurations  without  the need for preparing multiple probes. Using one binding probe, 9 probe configurations were created to profile HDAC complexes. Notably, this method identified indirect HDAC binders that may be inaccessible to traditional affinity probes, and it also revealed new biological implications for HDAC&#8208;associated proteins.

      <title>Excitonic aspect in polymeric photocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Owing to the intrinsically low dielectric properties, robust Coulomb interactions between photoinduced electrons and holes lead to dramatically strong exciton effects in polymeric photocatalysts. Such effects endow polymeric matrixes with nontrivial photoexcitation processes that are closely associated with photocatalytic solar energy utilization. In this Minireview, we describe recent progress in the investigation of excitonic aspect in polymeric photocatalysts. On the basis of the understanding of excitonic effects in polymeric semiconductors, we outline the relationships between excitonic behaviors and photocatalytic behaviors. Advances in excitonic regulation for gaining high&#8208;efficiency polymeric semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysis are summarized. We also discuss the challenges in the field of exciton&#8208;involved photocatalysis and forecast the directions for future research.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Owing to the intrinsically low dielectric properties, robust Coulomb interactions between photoinduced electrons and holes lead to dramatically strong exciton effects in polymeric photocatalysts. Such effects endow polymeric matrixes with nontrivial photoexcitation processes that are closely associated with photocatalytic solar energy utilization. In this Minireview, we describe recent progress in the investigation of excitonic aspect in polymeric photocatalysts. On the basis of the understanding of excitonic effects in polymeric semiconductors, we outline the relationships between excitonic behaviors and photocatalytic behaviors. Advances in excitonic regulation for gaining high&#8208;efficiency polymeric semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysis are summarized. We also discuss the challenges in the field of exciton&#8208;involved photocatalysis and forecast the directions for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>PST&#8208;24: A Zeolite with Varying Intracrystalline Channel Dimensionality</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we report the synthesis, structure solution, and catalytic properties of PST&#8208;24, a novel channel&#8208;based medium&#8208;pore zeolite. This zeolite was synthesized using pentamethylimidazolium ions as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent via the excess fluoride approach. A combination of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electron diffraction and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy shows that its structure is built by composite  cas&#8208;zigzag  (  cas&#8208;zz  ) building chains, which are connected by double 5&#8208;ring (  d5r  ) columns. While the  cas&#8208;zz  building chains are ordered in the PST&#8208;24 framework, the  d5r  columns adopt one of two possible arrangements; the two adjacent  d5r  columns are either at the same height or at different heights, denoted arrangements S and D, which can be regarded as open and closed &#8220;valves&#8221; that connect the channels, respectively. A framework with arrangement D only has a 2D 10&#8208;ring channel system, whereas that with arrangement S only contains 3D channels. In actual PST&#8208;24 crystals, the open and closed valves are almost randomly dispersed to yield a zeolite framework where the channel dimensionality varies locally from 2D to 3D. Such a unique pore structure renders PST&#8208;24 highly selective for 1,3&#8208;butanediol dehydration.</dc:description>

      <title>Rabies Virus&#8208;Inspired Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Targeted Imaging and Chemotherapy of Glioma</title>
      <dc:description>The blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) restricts access to the brain of more than 98% of therapeutic agents and is largely responsible for treatment failure of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Therefore, it is of great importance to develop a safe and efficient strategy for more effective drug delivery across the BBB into the brain. Inspired by the extraordinary capability of rabies virus (RABV) to enter the central nervous system, we report the development and evaluation of the metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;based nanocarrier MILB@LR, which closely mimicked both the bullet&#8208;shape structure and surface functions of natural RABV. MILB@LR benefited from a more comprehensive RABV&#8208;mimic strategy than mimicking individual features of RABV and exhibited significantly enhanced BBB penetration and brain tumor targeting. MILB@LR also displayed superior inhibition of tumor growth when loaded with oxaliplatin. The results demonstrated that MILB@LR may be valuable for GBM targeting and treatment.</dc:description>

      <title>A Planar, Conjugated N4&#8208;macrocyclic Cobalt Complex for Heterogeneous Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction with High Activity</title>
      <dc:description>Metal complexes have been widely investigated as promising electrocatalysts for CO  2  reduction. Most of the current research efforts mainly focus on ligands based on pyrrole subunits and the reported activities are still far from satisfactory. A novel planar and conjugated N4&#8208;macrocyclic cobalt complex (Co(II)CPY) derived from phenanthroline subunits is prepared herein, which delivers high activity for heterogeneous CO  2  electrocatalysis to CO in an aqueous medium and outperforms most of the metal complexes reported so far. At a molar loading of 5.93&#215;10  &#8208;8  mol cm  &#8208;2  , it exhibits a Faradaic efficiency of 96% and a turnover frequency of 9.59 s  &#8208;1  towards CO at &#8208;0.70 V  vs  . RHE. The unraveling of electronic structural features suggests a synergistic effect from ligand to cobalt in Co(II)CPY plays a critical role in boosting its activity. As a result, the free energy difference for the formation of *COOH is lower than that on cobalt porphyrin, leading to enhanced CO production.</dc:description>
