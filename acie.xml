      <title>Ultrasound controlled anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization of platelet decorated microglia for targeted ischemic stroke therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Stroke is a neurological disease with poor prognosis. Strong inflammatory and immune response exist after stroke, resulting in severe sequelae with high mortality. Microglia, the main immune cell in cerebrum, possess therapeutic potential for stroke as its specific anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype can reduce inflammation and promote neuron regeneration. However, the on&#8208;demand anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization of microglia at stroke site is uncontrollable for therapeutic application. Here, we develop a platelet hybrid microglia platform which can specifically polarize to anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype by ultrasound irradiation for targeted cerebrum repair after stroke. The engineered microglia have strong adherence to the injured cerebral vessels with platelet membrane fusion and can realize on&#8208;demand anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization with the ultrasound responsive IL&#8208;4 liposome decoration. Intravenously injected microglia platform showed anticipated anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization at stroke site with insonation control and accelerated the M2&#8208;type polarization of endogenous microglia for long&#8208;tern stroke recovery. Satisfied prognoses were achieved with reduced apoptosis, promoted neurogenesis and functional recovery, indicating the implications of microglia platform for stroke therapy.</dc:description>

      <title>Contemporary Approaches for Site&#8208;selective Dual Functionalization of Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective modification of proteins is a burgeoning field and serves as an invaluable tool for the precise analysis of proteins structures and functions in complicated cellular environments or the innovation of protein therapeutics with improved features. Besides the widely&#8208;reported single modification of proteins, site&#8208;selective dual functionalization has stood out, as the incorporation of two distinct functionalities greatly enriches the structural and functional diversities of protein therapeutics. The resultant protein bioconjugates combine the advantages of the active biomolecules and up to two synthetic functionalities such as drugs, imaging reagents and polymers. In this way, dual chromophore modified protein bioconjugates shed light into protein trafficking and folding in their native environment or dual modified protein therapeutics provide new avenues for bioimaging, biosensing, and cancer therapy. This review aims to give readers a timely overview of the recent advancements and a future perspective of this field. First, recent developments in the methodologies for dual modification of proteins are discussed. The strengths and limitations of each strategy are summarized in order to enable readers to select the most appropriate method for their envisaged applications. Thereafter, representative applications of these dual&#8208;modified protein bioconjugates benefiting from the synergistic/additive properties of the two synthetic moieties are highlighted.</dc:description>

      <title>Click&#8208;Functionalization of a Poly(Tetrazine)&#8208;co&#8208;Fluorene&#8208;Conjugated Polymer with a Series of trans&#8208;Cyclooctene Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
A conjugated polymer containing tetrazine groups in the backbone was prepared and found to undergo rapid inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) click chemistry, enabling facile functionalization with a variety of trans&#8208;cyclooctene derivatives. The product polymers change color, become fluorescent, and exhibit changes to their physical properties, such as solubility, depending on the functionality that is appended.







Abstract
A soluble poly(tetrazine) polymer was prepared via Suzuki polycondensation of 3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;bromofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine and a fluorene diboronate derivative. It can undergo efficient and quantitative post&#8208;polymerization inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder click reactions with a variety of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) derivatives. The resulting polymers were oxidized to convert dihydropyridazine rings into pyridazines. The absorption spectra of the product polymers, both before and after oxidation, showed hypsochromic shifts that correlated with steric hindrance of the appended side chains. They also exhibited a significantly enhanced fluorescence intensity relative to the original poly(tetrazine). While gel&#8208;permeation chromatography indicated that the product polymers exhibited longer retention times, NMR end&#8208;group analysis showed that the polymers retained relatively constant degrees of polymerization. Graft copolymers were easily prepared via reaction with TCO&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) chains and a cross&#8208;linked foam was produced by reacting the poly(tetrazine) with a bis&#8208;TCO crosslinker.

      <title>Biological Nanopore Approach for Single&#8208;Molecule Protein Sequencing</title>
      <dc:description>Proteins are responsible for the occurrence and treatment of many diseases, and therefore protein sequencing will revolutionize proteomics and clinical diagnostics. Biological nanopore approach has proved successful for single&#8208;molecule DNA sequencing, which resolves the identities of 4 natural deoxyribonucleotides based on the current blockages and duration times of their translocations across the nanopore confinement. However, open challenges still remain for biological nanopores to sequentially identify each amino acid (AA) of single proteins due to the inherent complexity of 20 proteinogenic AAs in charges, volumes, hydrophobicity and structures. Herein, we focus on recent exciting advances in biological nanopores for single&#8208;molecule protein sequencing (SMPS) from native protein unfolding, control of peptide translocation, AA identification to applications in disease detection.</dc:description>

      <title>Atomically precise preorganization of open metal sites on gold nanocluster with high catalytic performance</title>
      <dc:description>The design and synthesis of gold nanoclusters with surface open sites are crucial for practical applications in catalysis. We have developed a &#8220;surface geometric mismatch&#8221; strategy by using mixed ligands of different type of hindrance. When bulky phosphine Ph 3  P and planar dipyridyl amine (Hdpa) are simultaneously used, the steric repulsion between the ligands will reduce the ligand coverage of gold clusters, therefore the coordinative unsaturation of gold atoms is attained. A well&#8208;defined access granted gold nanocluster [Au 23  (Ph 3  P) 10  (dpa) 2  Cl](SO 3  CF 3  ) 2  ( Au 23  , dpa = dipyridylamido) has been successfully synthesized. Single crystal structural determination reveals that Au 23  has eight uncoordinated gold atoms in the shape of a distorted bicapped triangular prism. The accessibility of the exposed Au atoms has been confirmed quantitatively by luminescent titration with 2&#8208;naphthalenethiol. Furthermore, this cluster has excellent performance toward selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. This atomically precise cluster stays intact after the catalytic reaction, demonstrating its excellent stability due to the protection of negatively charged multidentate ligand dpa.</dc:description>

      <title>Behaviour of novel smart surfactants in stabilizing pH&#8208;responsive emulsions</title>
      <dc:description>Newly structured pH&#8208;responsive smart surfactants (abbreviated as N  +  &#8208;(n)&#8208;N, n=14, 16) were synthesized by connecting a tertiary amine group at the end of the hydrophobic chain in alkyl trimethylammonium bromides. In neutral and alkaline media, N  +  &#8208;(n)&#8208;N behaves as a normal cationic surfactant and can stabilize conventional emulsions alone, as well as Pickering emulsions and novel oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions together with oppositely and similarly charged nanoparticles, respectively. In acidic media however, N  +  &#8208;(n)&#8208;N is turned to a strongly hydrophilic Bola type surfactant N  +  &#8208;(n)&#8208;NH  +  due to formation of the amine salt, which is an inferior emulsifier either when used alone or together with charged nanoparticles resulting in demulsification. Specifically, N  +  &#8208;(n)&#8208;NH  +  returns to the aqueous phase alone or together with nanoparticles after demulsification without contaminating the oil phase, and the whole aqueous phase can be recycled many times triggered by pH. We thus offer a new protocol towards designing and synthesizing newly structured and recyclable smart surfactants, and specifically make it a green process to prepare various temporarily stable emulsions which are often applied in emulsion polymerization, heterogeneous catalysis and oil transportation.</dc:description>

      <title>A Dual Role Reductase from Phytosterols Catabolism Enables the Efficient Production of Valuable Steroid Precursors</title>
      <dc:description>4&#8208;androstenedione (4&#8208;AD) and progesterone (PG) are two of the most important precursors for synthesis of steroid drugs, however their current manufacturing processes suffer from low efficiency and severe environmental issues. In this study, we decipher a dual&#8208;role reductase (mnOpccR) in the phytosterols catabolism, which engages in two different metabolic branches to produce the key intermediate 20&#8208;hydroxymethyl pregn&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;3&#8208;one (4&#8208;HBC) through a 4&#8208;e reduction of 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;pregnene&#8208;20&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;CoA (3&#8208;OPC&#8208;CoA) and 2&#8208;e reduction of 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;pregnene&#8208;20&#8208;carboxyl aldehyde (3&#8208;OPA), respectively.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;4&#8208;androstenedione (4&#8208;AD) and progesterone (PG) are two of the most important precursors for synthesis of steroid drugs, however their current manufacturing processes suffer from low efficiency and severe environmental issues. In this study, we decipher a dual&#8208;role reductase (mnOpccR) in the phytosterols catabolism, which engages in two different metabolic branches to produce the key intermediate 20&#8208;hydroxymethyl pregn&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;3&#8208;one (4&#8208;HBC) through a 4&#8208;e reduction of 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;pregnene&#8208;20&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;CoA (3&#8208;OPC&#8208;CoA) and 2&#8208;e reduction of 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;pregnene&#8208;20&#8208;carboxyl aldehyde (3&#8208;OPA), respectively.

      <dc:description>Enabling high&#8208;performing alkali metal anodes at low temperature and lean electrolyte conditions is critical for the advancement of next&#8208;generation batteries with high energy density and improved safety. Herein, we present an ether&#8208;ionic liquid composite electrolyte to tackle the problem of dendrite growth of metallic sodium anode at low temperatures ranging from 0 to &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This composite electrolyte enables a stable sodium metal anode to be deeply cycled at 2 mA/cm&#178;&#160;with an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 50 mAh/cm&#178;&#160;for 500 hours at &#8722;20 &#176;C at lean electrolyte (1.0 &#181;L/mAh) condition. Using the composite electrolyte, full cells with Na&#8323;V&#8322;(PO&#8324;)&#8323;&#160;as cathode and sodium metal as anode are demonstrated with a high capacity retention of 90.7% after 1,000 cycles at 2C at &#8722;20 &#176;C. The sodium&#8208;carbon dioxide batteries also exhibit a reversible capacity of 1,000 mAh/g&#160;over 50 cycles at varied temperatures from &#8722;20 to 25 &#176;C.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>In this study, we describe the engineering of sub&#8208;100 nm nanomicelles (DTX&#8208;PC NMs) derived from phosphocholine derivative of docetaxel (DTX)&#8208;conjugated lithocholic acid (DTX&#8208;PC) and poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;tethered lithocholic acid.

Unlike DTX&#8208;TS, DTX&#8208;PC NMs do not cause any systemic toxicity and slow the decay rate of plasma DTX concentration in rodents and non&#8208;rodent species including non&#8208;human primates. We further demonstrate that DTX&#8208;PC NMs target demethylation of CpG islands of Sparcl1 (a tumor suppressor gene) by suppressing DNA methyltransferase activity, and increase the expression of Sparcl1 that leads to tumor regression. Therefore, this unique system has the potential to improve the quality of life in cancer patients, and can be translated as a next&#8208;generation chemotherapeutic.</dc:description>

      <title>Hierarchically Porous Biocatalytic MOF Microreactor as a Versatile Platform towards Enhanced Multienzyme and Cofactor&#8208;Dependent Biocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as excellent hosting matrices for enzyme immobilization, offering superior physical and chemical protection for biocatalytic reactions. However, for multienzyme and cofactor&#8208;dependent biocatalysis, the subtle orchestration of enzymes and cofactors is largely disrupted upon immobilizing in the rigid crystalline MOF network, which leads to a much reduced biocatalytic efficiency. Here we constructed hierarchically porous MOFs by controlled structural etching to enhance multienzyme and cofactor&#8208;dependent enzyme biocatalysis. The expanded size of the pores can provide sufficient space for accommodated enzymes to reorientate and spread within MOFs in their lower surface energy state as well to decrease the inherent barriers to accelerate the diffusion rate of reactants and intermediates. Moreover, the developed hierarchically porous MOFs demonstrated outstanding tolerance to inhospitable surroundings and recyclability. The ease, low cost, and potential scalability of the semi&#8208;confined strategy makes these hierarchically porous biocatalytic MOF microreactors as promising candidates for diverse biotechnological applications.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The photoelectronic properties of quantum dots (QDs) have a critical impact on the performance of quantum dot&#8208;sensitized solar cells (QDSCs).

The critical photoelectronic properties of target QDs, including bandgap, conduction band energy level, and density of defect trap states, can be conveniently tailored. Experimental results demonstrate that the ZCISSe quinary alloyed QDs can achieve an ideal balance among light&#8208;harvesting, photogenerated electron extraction, and charge collection efficiencies in QDSCs compared to its single anion or cation quaternary alloyed QD counterparts.

      <title>Masked Alkyne Equivalents for the Synthesis of Mechanically Interlocked Polyynes</title>
      <dc:description>Polyyne polyrotaxanes, encapsulated cyclocarbon catenanes and other fascinating mechanically interlocked carbon&#8208;rich architectures should become accessible if masked alkyne equivalents (MAEs) can be developed that are large enough to prevent unthreading of a macrocycle, and that can be cleanly unmasked under mild conditions. Here we report the synthesis of a new bulky MAE based on  t&#8208;  butylbicyclo[4.3.1]decatriene. This MAE was used to synthesize a polyyne [2]rotaxane and a masked&#8208;polyyne [3]rotaxane by Cadiot&#8208;Chodkiewicz coupling. Glaser cyclo&#8208;oligomerization of the [2]rotaxane gave masked cyclocarbon catenanes. The unmasking behavior of the catenanes and rotaxanes was tested by photolysis at a range of UV wavelengths. Photochemical unmasking did not proceed cleanly enough to prepare extended encapsulated polyyne polyrotaxanes. We highlight the scope and challenges involved with this approach to interlocked carbon&#8208;rich architectures.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>All&#8208;nitrogenated sugars (ANSs), in which all hydroxy groups in a carbohydrate are replaced with amino groups, are anticipated to be privileged structures with useful biological activities. However, ANS synthesis has been challenging due to the difficulty in the installation of multi&#8208;amino groups. We report herein the development of a concise synthetic route to peracetylated ANSs in seven steps from commercially available monosaccharides. The key to success is the use of the sequential Overman rearrangement, which enables formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in monosaccharides with amino groups. A variety of ANSs are available through the same reaction sequence starting from different initial monosaccharides by chirality transfer of secondary alcohols. Transformations of the resulting peracetylated ANSs such as glycosylation and deacetylation are also demonstrated. Biological studies reveal that ANS&#8208;modified cholesterol show cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines, whereas each ANS and cholesterol have no cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

      <title>Criegee Intermediates Beyond Ozonolysis: Recent Synthetic and Mechanistic Insights</title>
      <dc:description>After more than 70 years of discovery, &#8220;Criegee intermediates&#8221; (CIs) are back at the forefront of modern chemistry of short&#8208;lived reactive intermediates, playing an important role in the mechanistic context of chemical synthesis, total synthesis, pharmaceuticals, and, most importantly, climate&#8208;controlling aerosol formation as well as atmospheric chemistry. This report summarizes key aspects of CIs (from the mechanism of formation e.g. via ozonolysis of alkene and photolysis method employing diiodo&#8208; and diazo compounds to their electronic structures and chemical reactivity), highlights most recent findings and some landmark results of gas&#8208;phase kinetics, and detection/measurements. The recent progress in synthetic and mechanistic studies in CIs chemistry provide a guide to illustrate the possibilities for further investigations in this exciting field.</dc:description>

This report summarizes key aspects of CIs (from the mechanism of formation e.g. via ozonolysis of alkene and photolysis method employing diiodo&#8208; and diazo compounds to their electronic structures and chemical reactivity), highlights most recent findings and some landmark results of gas&#8208;phase kinetics, and detection/measurements. The recent progress in synthetic and mechanistic studies in CIs chemistry provide a guide to illustrate the possibilities for further investigations in this exciting field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Molecular cages self&#8208;assembled via imine condensation in water</title>
      <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly via imine condensation in aqueous media has been considered as a formidable task, due to the labile nature of imine in the presence of water. Here, by taking advantage of multivalence and ligand preorganization, a set of basket&#8208;shaped triscationic cage molecules are self&#8208;assembled in high yields as the predominant products in both water and organic solvent, by condensing a hexaformyl and bisamine. These cage products especially the chiral ones are rather stable or inert in aqueous solution, i.e., no decomposition was observed upon performing dilution, precipitation, or exposed to competitive amines or aldehydes. Such water&#8208;compatible nature allows the hosts to take advantage of hydrophobic effect to accommodate a variety of hydrophobic guests. The chiral cage  S  &#8208;  2  3+  is capable of selectively binding and distinguishing one of two enantiomers, opening up opportunities for applications such as chiral compound separation. Chiral narcissistic self&#8208;sorting and sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers effect are observed in the cage formation, when two amino precursors are involved in self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

      <title>Mixed Group 14&#8208;15 Metalates As Model Compounds For Doped Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
      <dc:description>Doping and alloying are valuable tools for modifying and enhancing the properties and performance of lead halide perovskites. However, the effects of heterovalent doping with Sb  3+  and Bi  3+  cations are still a matter of current investigation. Due to the different charge of the dopants compared to the constituting Pb  2+  ions, a simultaneous creation of defects is unavoidable and the influence of these defects and the actual metal substitution become entangled. Here, we present the first 14&#8208;15 iodido metalates, (BED)  4  PbE  2  I  16  (BED&#160;=&#160;  N  &#8208;benzylethylenediammonium; E = Sb (  1  ), Bi (  2  )), which are model compounds for doped lead iodide perovskites and display surprisingly low bandgaps of 2.01 (  1  ) and 1.88 eV (  2  ). Quantum chemical investigations show that this stems from a good electronic match between the PbI  6  and EI  6  units of the compounds. Our results provide a model system for doped perovskites, but also represent the first examples of a promising new class of metal halide materials.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Green production of NH  3  , especially Li&#8208;mediate electrochemical N  2  reduction reaction (NRR) in non&#8208;aqueous solutions, is attracting thronging research interest.

To understand the electrocatalytic process, we treated Au coated carbon fibrous paper (Au/CP) as the model catalyst.  In&#8208;situ  XRD for the first time witnessed the transformation of lithium intermediates during NRR. Au greatly improved electron transfer kinetics to catalyze metallic Li formation, and accordingly highly accelerated NRR spontaneously.

      <title>Superseding &#946;&#8208;Diketiminato Ligands: An Amido Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;Imine Ligand Stabilizes the Exhaustive Series of B=X Boranes (X = O, S, Se, Te)</title>
      <dc:description>While the C=X bond (X = O, S, Se, Te) in ketones and their heavier chalcogen analogues is an established structural entity, carbon&#180;s neighbor element boron reluctantly forms the respective B=X moieties, which has stimulated the quest for such species in the past few years. Based on the partial success achieved in this area by means of the N,N&#180;&#8208;chelating &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand (HNacNac), we present a new amido imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine ligand system (HAmIm), which gives rise to the isolation of an exhaustive series of Lewis acid free, monomeric chalcogeno B=X boranes with documented &#960;&#8208;bond character between boron and the chalcogen. The chalcogenobo&#8208;ranes are isoelectronic and isolobal the respective ketones. The chemical behavior of the oxoborane (B=O) strongly resembles the classical carbonyl reactivity in C=O bonds as demonstrated by four typical textbook examples including imine and ketal formation. The improved stability provided by the HAmIm ligand system arises (i) from the formation of more stable five&#8208;membered boron chelates vs. the six&#8208;membered NacNac analogues and (ii) from the incorporation of an imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine moiety providing enhanced &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;donation. We, therefore, propose that the new HAmIm ligand class may supersede the widely employed NacNac system in certain applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Biomimetic Amino Acid Functionalized Phenazine Flow Batteries with Long Lifetime at Near&#8208;Neutral pH</title>
      <dc:description>Aqueous organic redox flow battery is a promising electrochemical technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Here we report a biomimetic, ultra&#8208;stable AORFB utilizing an amino acid functionalized phenazine (AFP). A series of AFPs with various commercial amino acids at different substituted positions were synthesized and studied. 1,6&#8208;amino acid substituted phenazines display much higher stability during cycling when compared to 2,7&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;substituted AFPs. Mechanism investigations reveal that the reduced 2,7&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;AFPs tend to tautomerize and lose their reversible redox activities, while 1,6&#8208;AFPs possess ultra&#8208;high stability both in their oxidized and reduced states. By pairing 3,3'&#8208;(phenazine&#8208;1,6&#8208;diylbis(azanediyl))dipropionic acid (  1,6&#8208;DPAP  ) with ferrocyanide at pH 8 with 1.0 M electron concentration, this flow battery exhibits an OCV of 1.15 V and an extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.5% per year. These results show the importance of molecular engineering of redox&#8208;active organics for robust redox&#8208;flow batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Exploring a Fatigue&#8208;Free Layered Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectric for Photovoltaic Non&#8208;Volatile Memories</title>
      <dc:description>Ferroelectric materials, equipping a striking bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), have shown great potential for the next generation photovoltaic non&#8208;volatile memories. However, further applications of conventional ferroelectric materials are hindered by their poor performance. The family of hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics combining fascinating polarization and striking semiconducting properties presents significant possibilities.

Meanwhile,  BCPB  shows splendid BPVE properties with noticeable zero&#8208;bias photocurrent density (5 &#956;A/cm  2  ), and high on/off switching ratio of current (over 3&#215;10  5  ); these merits even overmatch the most known ferroelectric semiconductor BiFeO  3  .

      <title>Supramolecular Depolymerization in the Mixture of Two Poor Solvents: Mechanistic Insights and Modulation of Supramolecular Polymerization of Ionic &#960;&#8208;Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Solvents are fundamentally essential for the synthesis and processing of soft materials. Supramolecular polymers (SPs), an emerging class of soft materials, are usually stable in single and mixtures of poor solvents. In contrast to these preconceived notions, here we report the depolymerization of SPs in the mixture of two poor solvents. This surprising behavior was observed for well&#8208;known cationic perylene diimides (cPDIs) in the mixtures of water and amphiphilic organic solvents such as isopropanol (IPA). cPDIs form stable SPs in water and IPA but readily depolymerize into monomers in 50&#8208;70 vol% IPA containing water. This is due to the selective solvation of the &#960;&#8208;surface of cPDIs by alkyl chains of IPA and ionic side chains by water, as evidenced by molecular dynamic simulations. Moreover, by systematically changing the ratio between water and amphiphilic organic solvent, we could achieve an unprecedented supramolecular polymerization both by increasing and decreasing the solvent polarity.</dc:description>

      <title>Carboxylic Acid Reductase Can Catalyze Ester Synthesis in Aqueous Environments</title>
      <dc:description>Enzymatic esterification reactions under aqueous conditions are not common, as most of the well&#8208;known enzymes catalyzing esterification require the minimization of water or activated substrates for activity.&#160;This work reports a new reaction catalyzed by carboxylic acid reductase (CAR),&#160;an enzyme known to transform a broad spectrum of carboxylic acids into aldehydes, with the use of ATP, Mg  2+  , and NADPH as co&#8208;substrates. When NADPH was replaced by a nucleophilic alcohol, CAR from&#160;  Mycobacterium marinum  can catalyze esterification under aqueous conditions at room temperature. Addition of imidazole, especially at pH 10.0, significantly enhanced ester production. In comparison to other esterification enzymes such as&#160;acyltransferase and lipase,&#160;CAR gave higher esterification yields in direct esterification under aqueous conditions. The scalability of CAR catalyzed esterification was demonstrated for the synthesis of cinoxate, an active ingredient in sunscreen, with an isolated yield of 32%.

      <dc:description>Cell surface engineering with functional polymers is an effective strategy to modulate cell activity. In this work, we develop a new bio&#8208;palladium catalyzed polymerization strategy for in&#8208;situ synthesis of conjugated polymers on living cell surfaces. Through Sonagashira polymerization reaction, photoactive polyphenyleneethynylene (PPE) is synthesized on the cell surface via cell&#8208;generated bio&#8208;Pd catalyst. The in&#8208;situ formed PPE is identified by excellent light&#8208;harvest capacity and blue fluorescence on the surfaces of E. coli and C. pyrenoidosa. Besides imaging microbes for tracing the polymerization process, PPE also exhibits enhanced antibacterial activity against E. coli. Moreover, it can augment the ATP synthesis of C. pyrenoidosa through enlarging the light absorption and accelerating the cyclic electron transport of the algae. By using this bio&#8208;metal catalyzed polymerization method, functional polymers can be in&#8208;situ synthesized on the living cell surface, which paves a new way for modulating cell functions.</dc:description>

      <title>Docking of Cu(I) and Ag(I) in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Adsorption and Separation of Xenon</title>
      <dc:description>We present a metal docking strategy utilizing the precise spatial arrangement of organic struts as metal chelating sites in a MOF. Pairs of uncoordinated N&#8208;atoms on adjacent pyrazole dicarboxylate linkers distributed along the rod&#8208;shaped Al&#8211;O secondary building units in MOF&#8208;303 [Al(OH)(C5H2O4N2)] were used to chelate Cu(I) and Ag(I) with atomic precision and yield the metalated Cu&#8208; and Ag&#8208;MOF&#8208;303 compounds [(CuCl)0.50&#8208;Al(OH)(C5H2O4N2) and (AgNO3)0.49&#8208;Al(OH)(C5H2O4N2)]. The coordination geometries of Cu(I) and Ag(I) were examined using 3D electron diffraction and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy techniques. The resulting metalated MOFs showed pore sizes matching the size of Xe, thus allowing for binding of Xe from Xe/Kr mixtures with high capacity and selectivity. In particular, Ag&#8208;MOF&#8208;303 exhibited Xe uptake of 59 cm3 cm&#8208;3 at 298 K and 0.2 bar with a selectivity of 10.4, placing it among the highest performing MOFs. It also gave up to 100% improvement of the dynamic separation performance in comparison to pristine MOF&#8208;303. This metalation strategy represents a new strategy for engineering MOFs to give high&#8208;performance gas separations.</dc:description>

It also gave up to 100% improvement of the dynamic separation performance in comparison to pristine MOF&#8208;303. This metalation strategy represents a new strategy for engineering MOFs to give high&#8208;performance gas separations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Activating lattice oxygen at twisted surface in mesoporous CeO2 single crystal for efficient and durable catalytic CO oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Activating lattice oxygen linked to active sites at surface remains a fundamental challenge in many catalytic reactions. Here we create well&#8208;defined surface by directly growing porous CeO2 single crystals at 2 cm scale and confining Pt in lattice to construct isolated Pt1/CeO2 sites at continuously&#8208;twisted surface in a monolith. We demonstrate significantly enhanced activation of lattice oxygen linked to Pt ions in contrast to Ce ions in local structures. We show complete CO oxidation with air at 67 &#176;C without degradation being observed after operation of 300 hours. The isolated Pt1/CeO2 sites at twisted surfaces not only contribute to the chemisorption of CO but also effectively activate the lattice oxygen linked to Pt ion for CO oxidation. The current work would open a new route to activate lattice oxygen by incorporating well&#8208;defined active structures confined at the surfaces.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A major challenge in photocatalysis consists in improving the efficiency, for example by harnessing a large portion of the solar spectrum.

Moreover, the optimum hydrogen (H2) production activity was about 52 and 64 times higher with respect to its pristine counterpart under the AM 1.5G and visible irradiation, respectively, being equivalent to the platinum&#8208;assisted PCN.

      <dc:description>Vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskites are attracting significant attention due to their chemical diversity and interesting optoelectronic properties. With a view to understanding both the optical and magnetic properties of these compounds, two series of Ru  IV  halides are presented here;  A  2  RuCl  6  and  A  2  RuBr  6  , where  A  is K, NH  4  , Rb or Cs. We show that the optical properties and spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) behaviour can be tuned through changing the  A  cation and the halide. Within a series, the energy of the ligand to metal charge&#8208;transfer increases as the unit cell expands with the larger  A  cation, and the band gaps are higher for the respective chlorides than for the bromides. The magnetic moments of the systems are temperature&#8208;dependent due to a non&#8208;magnetic ground state with  J  eff  = 0 caused by SOC.

      <title>Inhibition of urease, a Ni&#8208;enzyme: the reactivity of a key thiol with mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted catechols elucidated by kinetic, structural and theoretical studies</title>
      <dc:description>Urease is a Ni(II)&#8208;containing enzyme able to catalyse the conversion of urea to ammonia and carbamate. Urea, the most used soil nitrogen fertiliser worldwide, is thus rapidly hydrolysed into species of nitrogen that can be taken up by plants, a function that, while essential, might also significantly decrease the efficiency of this process due to the release of gaseous species of nitrogen into the atmosphere, contributing to the green&#8208;house effect and to air pollution. Moreover, urease is also a virulence factor for ureolytic bacterial human pathogens that affect the health and livelihood of millions of people, especially, but not only, in developing nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America. For these reasons, strategies for the efficient inhibition of urease activity by molecules that interact with the enzyme and counterbalance its negative effects must be pursued. Here, the inhibition of urease from  Sporosarcina pasteurii  (SPU) and  Canavalia ensiformis  (jack bean, JBU) by a class of six aromatic poly&#8208;hydroxylated molecules, namely mono&#8208; and dimethyl&#8208;substituted catechols, was investigated on the basis of the inhibitory efficiency of the catechol scaffold. The aim was to probe the key step of a mechanism proposed for the inhibition of SPU by catechol, namely the sulfanyl radical attack on the aromatic ring, as well as to obtain critical information on the effect of substituents of the catechol aromatic ring on the inhibition efficacy of its derivatives. The crystal structures of all six SPU&#8208;inhibitors complexes, determined at high resolution, as well as kinetic data obtained on JBU and theoretical studies of the reaction mechanism using quantum mechanical calculations, revealed the occurrence of an irreversible inactivation of urease by means of a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic multistep mechanism, and indicate that, among all tested catechols, the mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;catechol is the most efficient inhibitor for urease.</dc:description>

      <title>Polymorphism of 2D Imine Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

      <title>Charge&#8208;promoted self&#8208;metalation of porphyrins on an oxide surface</title>
      <dc:description>Metalation and self&#8208;metalation reactions of porphyrins on oxide surfaces have recently gained interest. The mechanism of porphyrin self&#8208;metalation on oxides is, however, far from being understood. Herein, we show by a combination of results obtained with scanning tunneling microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and DFT computations, that the self&#8208;metalation of 2H&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;porphyrin on the surface of ultrathin MgO(001) films is promoted by charge transfer. By tuning the work function of the MgO(001)/Ag(001) substrate, we are able to control the charge and the metalation state of the porphyrin molecules on the surface.</dc:description>

      <title>Non&#8208;coordinative binding of O2 at the active center of a copper&#8208;dependent enzyme</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular oxygen (O2) is a sustainable oxidation reagent. O2 is abundant, it is strongly oxidizing but kinetically stable and its final reaction product is water. For these reasons learning how to activate O2 and how to steer its reactivity along desired reaction pathways is a longstanding challenge in chemical research.[1] Activation of ground&#8208;state diradical O2 can occur either via conversion to singlet oxygen or by one&#8208;electron reduction to superoxide. Many enzymes facilitate activation of O2 by direct fomation of a metal&#8208;oxygen coordination complex concomitant with inner sphere electron transfer. The formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) is an unusual mononuclear copper enzyme that appears to follow a different strategy. Atomic&#8208;resolution crystal structures of the precatalytic complex of FGE demonstrate that this enzyme binds O2 juxtaposed, but not coordinated to the catalytic CuI. Isostructural complexes that contain AgI instead of CuI or nitric oxide instead of O2 confirm that formation of the initial oxygenated complex of FGE does not depend on redox activity. A stepwise mechanism that decouples binding and activation of O2 is unprecedented for metal&#8208;dependent oxidases, but is reminiscent of flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>C&#8211;H activation&#8208;based ring&#8208;forming methods constitute a powerful approach for the construction of complex molecular architectures, especially those containing a congested stereocenter. Therefore, this strategy seems perfectly suited to address the synthesis of chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and bowl&#8208;shaped molecules, which are important target molecules in the field of organic electronic materials.

The current approach relies on the use of chiral bifunctional phosphine&#8208;carboxylate ligands and delivers diverse polycyclic compounds in high yield and with good to excellent enantioselectivity.

      <title>Oxidizing under Reductive Conditions: From Benzylic Ethers to Acetals with Perfect Atom&#8208;Economy by Titanocene(III)&#8208;Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>We describe a novel titanocene catalyzed method for the synthesis of acetals and hemiaminals from benzylic ethers and benzylic amines with pendant epoxides. The reaction proceeds by catalysis in single electron steps. The oxidative addition is constituted by an epoxide opening. A H&#8208;atom transfer to generate a benzylic radical serves as radical translocation step, and an organometallic oxygen rebound as reductive elimination. The reaction&#8208;mechanism was studied by high level dispersion corrected hybrid functional DFT with implicit solvation. The low&#8208;energy conformational space was searched by the efficient CREST program. The stereoselectivity can be deduced from the lowest lying benzylic radical structures. Their conformations are controlled by hyperconjugative interactions and by steric interactions between the titanocene&#8208;catalyst and the aryl groups of the substrate. A particularly interesting mechanistical aspect is that the oxidation of the benzylic center occurs under reducing conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Sulfur&#8208;coordinated organoiridium(III) complexes exert anti&#8208;breast cancer activity via inhibiting Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling</title>
      <dc:description>The sulfur&#8208;coordinated organoiridium(III) complexes  pbtIrSS  and  ppyIrSS  , which contain C,N and S,S (dithione) chelating ligands, are found to inhibit breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis  via  targeting Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling for the first time. Treatment with  pbtIrSS  and  ppyIrSS  induce the degradation of LRP6, thereby decreasing the protein levels of DVL2, &#946;&#8208;catenin and activated &#946;&#8208;catenin, resulting in downregulation of Wnt target genes CD44 and survivin. Additionally,  pbtIrSS  and  ppyIrSS  can suppress cell migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, both complexes show the ability to inhibit sphere formation and mediate stemness properties of breast cancer cells. Importantly,  pbtIrSS  exerts potent anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;metastasis effects in mouse xenograft models through the blockage of Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling. Taken together, our results indicate that  pbtIrSS  has great potential to be developed as a breast cancer therapeutic agent with a novel mechanism.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The sulfur&#8208;coordinated organoiridium(III) complexes  pbtIrSS  and  ppyIrSS  , which contain C,N and S,S (dithione) chelating ligands, are found to inhibit breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis  via  targeting Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling for the first time. Treatment with  pbtIrSS  and  ppyIrSS  induce the degradation of LRP6, thereby decreasing the protein levels of DVL2, &#946;&#8208;catenin and activated &#946;&#8208;catenin, resulting in downregulation of Wnt target genes CD44 and survivin. Additionally,  pbtIrSS  and  ppyIrSS  can suppress cell migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, both complexes show the ability to inhibit sphere formation and mediate stemness properties of breast cancer cells. Importantly,  pbtIrSS  exerts potent anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;metastasis effects in mouse xenograft models through the blockage of Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling. Taken together, our results indicate that  pbtIrSS  has great potential to be developed as a breast cancer therapeutic agent with a novel mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>DNA Triplex and Quadruplex Assembled Nanosensors for Correlating K+ and pH in Lysosomes</title>
      <dc:description>It remains an unanswered question whether the flux of K  +  and H  +  in lysosomes are correlated due to difficulties in simultaneously imaging these two ions. This question is of great value for understanding lysosomal acidification. Herein, we designed DNA quadruplex and triplex based luminescent nanosensors that can respectively monitor K  +  and pH in lysosomal lumen. Each sensor contained an upconversion nanoparticle luminophore and a gold nanoparticle quencher, producing green and blue luminescence signals for K  +  and H  +  , respectively. The sensors were tested in buffers showing dynamic ranges of 5 to 200 mM K  +  and pH 5.0 to 8.2. Co&#8208;imaging using these two sensors in cells indicated that the efflux of K  +  was accompanied with the influx of H  +  , solving this long&#8208;standing question of the lysosomal biochemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Translation of Mycobacterium Survival Strategy to Develop a Lipo&#8208;peptide based Fusion Inhibitor</title>
      <dc:description>The entry of enveloped viruses requires the fusion of viral and host cell membranes. An effective fusion inhibitor aiming at impeding such membrane fusion may emerge as a broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral agent against a wide range of viral infections.  Mycobacterium  survives inside the phagosome by inhibiting phagosome&#8208;lysosome fusion with the help of a coat protein coronin 1. Structural analysis of coronin 1 and other WD40&#8208;repeat protein suggest that the trp&#8208;asp (WD) sequence is placed at distorted &#946;&#8208;meander motif (more exposed) in coronin 1. The unique structural feature of coronin 1 was explored to identify a simple lipo&#8208;peptide sequence (myr&#8208;WD), which effectively inhibits membrane fusion by modulating the interfacial order, water penetration, and surface potential.

      <dc:description>Single&#8208;cell and  in situ  cell&#8208;based operation with nanopipette approach offers a possibility to elucidate the intracellular processes and may aid the improvement of therapy efficiency and precision. We present here a photo&#8208;responsive hydrogel&#8208;nanopipette hybrid system that can achieve single&#8208;cell operation with high spatial/temporal resolution and negligible cell&#8208;damage. This strategy overcomes long&#8208;time obstacles in nanopipette single&#8208;cell studies as high electric potential (~1000 mV) or organic solvent is always used during operations, which would inevitably impose disturbance and damage to targeted cells. The light&#8208;triggered system promotes a potential&#8208;free, non&#8208;invasive single&#8208;cell injection, resulting in a well&#8208;retained cell viability (90% survival rate). Moreover, the photo&#8208;driven injection enables a precisely dose&#8208;controllable single&#8208;cell drug delivery. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, significantly reduced lethal doses of doxorubicin (163&#8208;217 fg/cell) are demonstrated in corresponding cell lines, indicating a potential precision cell therapy strategy based on the photo&#8208;responsive hydrogel&#8208;nanopipette system.</dc:description>

      <title>Combining incompatible processes for deracemization of a Praziquantel derivative under flow conditions</title>
      <dc:description>An efficient deracemization method for conversion of the racemate to the desirable (  R  )&#8208;enantiomer has been developed by coupling incompatible racemization and crystallization processes. By a library approach a derivative that crystallizes as a conglomerate in the solid phase has been identified. Racemization occurs via reversible hydrogenation over a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) packed column at 130 &#176;C, whereas deracemization is achieved by alternating crystal growth/dissolution steps with temperature cycling between 5&#8208;15 &#176;C. These incompatible processes are combined by means of a flow system. Complete deracemization of the solid phase to the desired (  R  )&#8208;enantiomer (98% ee) takes place. Such an unprecedented deracemization by a decoupled crystallization/racemization approach can readily be turned into a practical process, and opens new opportunities for the development of essential enantiomerically pure building blocks that require harsh methods for racemization.</dc:description>

      <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Quinolines Enabled by &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>The first example of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of N&#8208;heteroaromatics is reported. A new chiral pincer manganese catalyst showed outstanding catalytic activity in the asymmetric hydrogenation of quinolines, affording high yields and enantioselectivities (up to 97% ee). A turnover number of 3840 was reached at a low catalyst loading (S/C=4000), which was competitive with the activity of most effective noble metal catalysts for this reaction. The precise regulation of the enantioselectivity were ensured by a &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective [3+2] Annulation via Benzylic and meta C&#8208;H Bond Activation</title>
      <dc:description>The palladium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with maleimides via the activation of  ortho  benzylic C&#8208;H and meta C&#8208;H bonds is reported.

The first C&#8208;H bond activation at the benzylic C&#8208;H bond is followed by a second C&#8208;H bond activation at the meta C&#8208;H bond to give five&#8208;membered cyclic products.

      <title>A Stable Triplet&#8208;Ground&#8208;State Conjugated Diradical Based on a Diindenopyrazine Skeleton</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;spin conjugated radicals have great potential in magnetic materials and organic spintronics. However, to obtain high&#8208;spin conjugated radicals is still quite challenging due to their poor stability. Herein, we report the successful synthesis and isolation of a stable triplet conjugated diradical, 10,12&#8208;diaryldiindeno[1,2&#8208;b  :2',1'&#8208;e  ]pyrazine (m&#8208;DIP). With the  m&#8208;xylylene analogue skeleton containing electron&#8208;deficient  sp2&#8208;nitrogen atoms,  m&#8208;DIP  displays significant aromatic character within pyrazine ring and its spin density mainly delocalizes on the  meta&#8208;pyrazine unit, making it a triplet ground state conjugated diradical. Our work provides an effective "spin density tuning" strategy for stable high&#8208;spin conjugated radicals.</dc:description>

      <title>Novel &#946;&#8208;Glucocerebrosidase activators that bind to a new pocket at a dimer interface and induce dimerization</title>
      <dc:description>Genetic, preclinical and clinical data link Parkinson&#180;s disease and Gaucher's disease and provides a rational entry point to disease modification therapy via enhancement of &#946;&#8208;Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity. We discovered a new class of pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazine activators effecting both Vmax and Km. They bind to human GCase and increase substrate metabolism in the lysosome in a cellular assay. We obtained the first crystal structure for an activator and identified a novel non&#8208;inhibitory binding mode at the interface of a dimer, rationalizing the observed structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR). The compound binds GCase inducing formation of a dimeric state at both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomal pHs, as confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation. Importantly, the pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazines have central nervous system (CNS) drug&#8208;like properties. Our findings are important for future drug discovery efforts in the field of GCase activation and provides a deeper mechanistic understanding of the requirements for enzymatic activation, pointing to the relevance of dimerization.</dc:description>

      <title>Impact of organic templates on the selective formation of zeolite oligomers</title>
      <dc:description>Zeolites are essential materials to industry due to their adsorption and catalytic properties. The best current approach to prepare a targeted zeolite still relies on trial and error&#8217;s synthetic procedures since a rational understanding of the impact of synthesis variables on the final structures is still missing. To discern the role of a variety of organic templates, we perform simulations of the early stages of condensation of silica oligomers by combining DFT, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Evans&#8208;Polanyi relationships and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. We investigate an extended reaction path mechanism including 258 equilibrium reactions and 242 chemical species up to silica octamers, comparing the computed concentrations of Si oligomers with  29  SI NMR experimental data. The effect of the templating agent is linked to the modification of the intramolecular H&#8208;bond network in the growing oligomer, which produces higher concentration of 4&#8208;membered ring intermediates, precursors of the key double&#8208;four ring building blocks present on more than 39 known zeolite topologies.</dc:description>
