         <title>Chiral Induction in Buckminsterfullerene Using a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Buckminsterfullerene (C60) is one of the most symmetrical molecules. Nanoconfinement of C60 within a chiral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) are able to perturb the inherent symmetry of C60 via the host&#8211;guest interactions. As a consequent, C60 confined in the MOF exhibited unprecedented substantial chiroptical properties.







Abstract
Chiral induction is an emerging topic of interest in various areas of chemistry because of its relationship to the elusive mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking in nature. Buckminsterfullerene (C60) with the shape of a highly symmetric truncated icosahedron has rarely been referred for chiral induction due to the difficult symmetry breaking. In this work, we demonstrate that a chiral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) can provide a key field for chiral induction. C60 could be incorporated into the chiral nanochannels of the MOF using an in situ self&#8208;assembly strategy. The circular dichroism spectra of the resulting nanocomposites showed an intense chiral signal in the absorption region of C60. Experimental and theoretical studies showed that this unprecedented chiral induction of C60 was attributed to hybridization of the molecular orbitals through a close association with the pore surface of the MOF. Our method can endow highly symmetric achiral compounds with chirality, paving the new way toward fabrication of novel chiral nanomaterials.

         <title>Selective Bacterial Targeting and Infection&#8208;Triggered Release of Antibiotic Colistin Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional peptide&#8211;colistin conjugate for the treatment of bacterial infections has been synthesized. The conjugate binds to E.&#8197;coli bacteria by an all&#8208;d sequence of the human peptide ubiquicidin29&#8211;41. Host immune cells, activated upon infection, secrete the enzyme neutrophil elastase that cleaves an optimized linker sequence to release free colistin, a potent antibiotic that kills the bacteria.







Abstract
In order to render potent, but toxic antibiotics more selective, we have explored a novel conjugation strategy that includes drug accumulation followed by infection&#8208;triggered release of the drug. Bacterial targeting was achieved using a modified fragment of the human antimicrobial peptide ubiquicidin, as demonstrated by fluorophore&#8208;tagged variants. To limit the release of the effector colistin only to infection&#8208;related situations, we introduced a linker that was cleaved by neutrophil elastase (NE), an enzyme secreted by neutrophil granulocytes at infection sites. The linker carried an optimized sequence of amino acids that was required to assure sufficient cleavage efficiency. The antibacterial activity of five regioisomeric conjugates prepared by total synthesis was masked, but was released upon exposure to recombinant NE when the linker was attached to amino acids at the 1&#8208; or the 3&#8208;position of colistin. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept was achieved in co&#8208;cultures of primary human neutrophils and Escherichia coli that induced the secretion of NE, the release of free colistin, and an antibacterial efficacy that was equal to that of free colistin.

         <title>N&#8208;Atom Deletion in Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excising the nitrogen in secondary amines, and&#160;coupling the two residual fragments is a skeletal editing strategy that can be used to construct molecules with new skeletons, but which has been largely unexplored. Here we report a versatile method of N&#8208;atom excision from N&#8208;heterocycles. The process uses readily available N&#8208;heterocycles as substrates, and proceeds by N&#8208;sulfonylazidonation followed by the rearrangement of sulfamoyl azide intermediates, providing various cyclic products. Examples are provided of deletion of nitrogen from natural products, synthesis of chiral O&#8208;heterocycles from commercially available chiral &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols, formal inert C&#8211;H functionalization through a sequence of N&#8208;directed C&#8211;H functionalization and N&#8208;atom deletion reactions in which the N&#8208;atom can serve as a traceless directing group.</dc:description>

         <title>An Atomic Insight into the Chemical Origin and Variation of Dielectric Constant in Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dielectric constant is a crucial physicochemical property of liquids in tuning solute&#8211;solvent interactions and solvation microstructures. Herein the dielectric constant variation of liquid electrolytes regarding to temperatures and electrolyte compositions is probed by molecular dynamics simulations. Dielectric constants of solvents reduce as temperatures increase due to accelerated mobility of molecules. For solvent mixtures with different mixing ratios, their dielectric constants either follow a linear superposition rule or satisfy a polynomial function, depending on weak or strong intermolecular interactions. Dielectric constants of electrolytes exhibit a volcano trend with increasing salt concentrations, which can be attributed to dielectric contributions from salts and formation of solvation structures. This work affords an atomic insight into the dielectric constant variation and its chemical origin, which can deepen the fundamental understanding in solution chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistical Dipole&#8208;Dipole Interactions Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Phenoxazine&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Delicately designed dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) with ordered structure have become one of the major strategies to achieve high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we report two donor&#8208;&#960; linker&#8208;donor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D) HTMs,  N01  and  N02  , which consist of facilely synthesized 4,8&#8208;di(  n  &#8208;hexyloxy)&#8208;benzo[1,2&#8208;  b  :4,5&#8208;  b'  ]dithiophene as a &#960; linker, with 10&#8208;bromohexyl&#8208;10  H  &#8208;phenoxazine and 10&#8208;hexyl&#8208;10  H  &#8208;phenoxazine as donors, respectively. Very interestingly, the results from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions show that different alkyl substituents with/without bromine termination can render the molecules to self&#8208;assemble distinctively due to varied dipole&#8208;dipole interactions among adjacent molecules. Particularly, the  N01  molecules form a two&#8208;dimensional conjugated network governed by C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br interaction between phenoxazine donors, and synchronously construct a three&#8208;dimension lamellar structure with the aid of interlaminar &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction. Consequently,  N01  as a dopant&#8208;free small&#8208;molecule HTM exhibits a higher intrinsic hole mobility and more favorable interfacial properties for hole transport, hole extraction and perovskite growth, enabling an inverted PSC to achieve a very impressive power conversion efficiency of 21.85%.</dc:description>

Macrocycle&#8208;crosslinked polymers were recently shown to be effective adsorbents for nonpolar or charged organic micropollutants through specific host&#8208;guest binding, but are rarely used for the treatment of neutral and polar organic micropollutants. This is due to the challenge of recognizing polar molecules in water by macrocyclic hosts. In this research, we report two amide naphthotube&#8208;crosslinked polymers which can effectively and rapidly adsorb a wide scope of polar organic micropollutants from water through biomimetic molecular recognition. Amide naphthotubes possess hydrogen bonding sites in their deep hydrophobic cavities and can effectively bind polar organic micropollutants in water through the hydrophobic effects and shielded hydrogen bonds. The cross&#8208;linked polymers containing amide naphthotubes are even able to remove a complex mixture of organic micropollutants from water and the used materials can be easily regenerated through washing with MeOH or EtOH. This research provides a solution for the treatment of polar organic micropollutants by using biomimetic molecular recognition in water.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bonding in beryllocene, [BeCp  2  ], took decades to establish, owing to its unexpected mixed hapticity structure (i.e., [Be(&#951;  5  &#8208;Cp)(&#951;  1  &#8208;Cp)]). Beryllium complexes containing the indenyl ligand, which is a close relative of the cyclopentadienyl anion, but which is also known to exhibit its own bonding peculiarities (e.g., facile &#951;  5  &#8644; &#951;  3  shifts), have remained unknown. Standard metathetical approaches to their synthesis (e.g., with K[Ind&#180;] + BeX  2  in an ether solvent) give rise to intractable oils from which nothing identifiable can be isolated. In contrast, mechanochemical preparation, involving the solvent&#8208;free grinding of BeBr  2  and potassium indenides, leads to the production of discrete (indenyl)beryllium complexes, including [Be(C  9  H  7  )  2  ] (  1  ) and [Be{1,3&#8208;(SiMe  3  )  2  C  9  H  5  }Br] (  2  ). The former displays &#951;  5  /&#951;  1  &#8208;coordinated ligands in the solid state, but DFT calculations indicate that a &#951;  5  /&#951;  5  &#8208;conformation is less than 5 kcal mol  &#8211;1  higher in energy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>D&#8208;amino acids (DAAs) are indispensable in regulating diverse metabolic pathways. Selective and sensitive detection of DAAs is crucial for understanding the complexity of metabolic processes and managing associated diseases. However, current DAA detection strategies mainly rely on bulky instrumentation or electrochemical probes, limiting their cellular and animal applications. Here we report an enzyme&#8208;coupled nanoprobe that can detect enantiospecific DAAs through synergistic energy transfer. This nanoprobe offers near&#8208;infrared upconversion capability, a wide dynamic detection range, and a detection limit of 2.2 &#956;M, providing a versatile platform for  in vivo  noninvasive detection of DAAs with high enantioselectivity. These results potentially allow real&#8208;time monitoring of biomolecular handedness in living animals, as well as developing antipsychotic treatment strategies  .</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Regulation on Solvation Shell and Electrode Interface for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Ion Batteries Achieved by a Low&#8208;Cost Glucose Additive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost glucose additive into traditional ZnSO4 electrolyte can greatly inhibit the dendrite growth on Zn anodes in Zn ion batteries by simultaneously modulating the solvation shell in the electrolyte and electrode interface.







Abstract
Dendrite growth and by&#8208;products in Zn metal aqueous batteries have impeded their development as promising energy storage devices. We utilize a low&#8208;cost additive, glucose, to modulate the typical ZnSO4 electrolyte system for improving reversible plating/stripping on Zn anode for high&#8208;performance Zn ion batteries (ZIBs). Combing experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations, we show that the glucose in ZnSO4 aqueous environment can simultaneously modulate solvation structure of Zn2+ and Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. The electrolyte engineering can alternate one H2O molecule from the primary Zn2+&#8208;6H2O solvation shell and restraining side reactions due to the decomposition of active water. Concomitantly, glucose molecules are inclined to absorb on the surface of Zn anode, suppressing the random growth of Zn dendrite. As a proof of concept, a symmetric cell and Zn&#8208;MnO2 full cell with glucose electrolyte achieve boosted stability than that with pure ZnSO4 electrolyte.

         <title>Molecular Basis for Two Stereoselective Diels&#8211;Alderases that Produce Decalin Skeletons**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Powerful combination of experimental methods and calculations highlights the distinct molecular mechanisms underlying stereoselective [4+2] cycloadditions catalyzed by a pair of decalin synthases, Fsa2 and Phm7, that catalyze intramolecular cycloadditions to form enantiomeric decalin scaffolds. Our proposed mechanism would open a new window on the enzymatic [4+2] cycloadditions.







Abstract
Enzymes catalyzing [4+2] cycloaddition have attracted increasing attention because of their key roles in natural product biosynthesis. Here, we solved the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of a pair of decalin synthases, Fsa2 and Phm7, that catalyze intramolecular [4+2] cycloadditions to form enantiomeric decalin scaffolds during biosynthesis of the HIV&#8208;1 integrase inhibitor equisetin and its stereochemical opposite, phomasetin. Computational modeling, using molecular dynamics simulations as well as quantum chemical calculations, demonstrates that the reactions proceed through synergetic conformational constraints assuring transition state&#8208;like substrates folds and their stabilization by specific protein&#8208;substrate interactions. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments verified the binding models. Intriguingly, the flexibility of bound substrates is largely different in two enzymes, suggesting the distinctive mechanism of dynamics regulation behind these stereoselective reactions. The proposed reaction mechanism herein deepens the basic understanding how these enzymes work but also provides a guiding principle to create artificial enzymes.

         <title>Electrochromic Polycationic Organoboronium Macrocycles with Multiple Redox States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycationic organoboronium macrocycles comprising four bipyridylboronium units in a cyclic conjugated framework are introduced, with the boron cations linked by fluorene and two electron&#8208;deficient arylborane or two electron&#8208;rich arylamine moieties. Cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemical studies reveal that multiple redox states can be reversibly accessed with transfer of up to 10&#8197;electrons and switchable electrochromic properties are realized.







Abstract
Polycationic macrocycles are attractive as they display unique molecular switching capabilities arising from their redox properties. Although diverse polycationic macrocycles have been developed, those based on cationic boron systems remain very limited. We present herein the development of novel polycationic macrocycles by introducing organoboronium moieties into a conjugated organoboron macrocyclic framework. These macrocycles consist of four bipyridylboronium units that are connected by fluorene and either electron&#8208;deficient arylborane or electron&#8208;rich arylamine moieties. Electrochemical studies reveal that the macrocycles undergo reversible multi&#8208;step redox processes with transfer of up to 10&#8197;electrons. Switchable electrochromic behavior is demonstrated via spectroelectrochemical studies and the observed color changes are rationalized by correlation with computed electronic transitions using DFT methods.

         <title>Heterogeneously Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation of Methane to a Methyl Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane is aerobically converted to an oxidation&#8208;resistant methyl ester in high yields with a solid cobalt&#8208;containing catalyst at a moderate temperature and pressure. Improved reaction conditions result from the dilution of the trifluoroacetic acid in an inert perfluoroalkane co&#8208;solvent. The fluorous character of the solvent enables the facile recovery of the product ester through a simple liquid&#8208;liquid extraction with non&#8208;fluorous solvent.







Abstract
A promising strategy to break through the selectivity&#8208;conversion limit of direct methane conversion to achieve high yields is the protection of methanol via esterification to a more stable methyl ester. We present an aerobic methane&#8208;to&#8208;methyl&#8208;ester approach that utilizes a highly dispersed, cobalt&#8208;containing solid catalyst, along with significantly more favorable reaction conditions compared to existing homogeneously&#8208;catalyzed approaches (e.g. diluted acid, O2 oxidant, moderate temperature and pressure). The trifluoroacetic acid medium is diluted (&lt;25&#8197;wt&#8201;%) with an inert fluorous co&#8208;solvent that can be recovered after the separation of the methyl trifluoroacetate via liquid&#8211;liquid extraction at ambient conditions. Silica&#8208;supported cobalt catalysts are highly active in this system, with competitive yields and turnovers in comparison to known aerobic transition metal&#8208;based catalytic systems.

         <title>Spatially Selective Imaging of Mitochondrial MicroRNAs via Optically Programmable Strand Displacement Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optically controlled DNA nanoreporter technology was reported for imaging of mitochondrial microRNAs in vitro and in vivo. This was accomplished by mitochondria&#8208;targeted localization and near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;initiated programmable strand displacement reactions.







Abstract
MicroRNA (miRNA) functions are tightly regulated by their sub&#8208;compartmental location in living cells, and the ability to imaging of mitochondrial miRNAs (mitomiRs) is essential for understanding of the related pathological processes. However, most existing DNA&#8208;based methods could not be used for this purpose. Here, we report the development of a DNA nanoreporter technology for imaging of mitomiRs in living cells through near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled DNA strand displacement reactions. The sensing function of the DNA nanoreporters are silent (OFF) during the delivery process, but can be photoactivated (ON) with NIR light after targeted mitochondrial localization, enabling spatially&#8208;restricted imaging of two types of cancer&#8208;related mitomiRs with improved detection accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate imaging of mitomiRs in vivo through spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled delivery and activation. Therefore, this study illustrates a simple methodology that may be broadly applicable for investigating the mitomiRs&#8208;associated physiological events.

         <title>Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Etherification of Branched Aldehydes via an Oxidative Umpolung Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aminocatalytic oxidative umpolung strategy for asymmetric etherification of the &#945;&#8208;position of branched aldehydes is presented. The protocol avoids pre&#8208;functionalization and employs commercially available oxygen nucleophiles. Polarity inversion proceeds via an aminocatalytic SN2 dynamic&#8208;kinetic resolution of in situ generated racemic quinone adducts.







Abstract
Saturated carbonyl compounds are, via their enolate analogues, inherently nucleophilic at the &#945;&#8208;position. In the presence of a benzoquinone oxidant, the polarity of the &#945;&#8208;position of racemic &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes is inverted, allowing for an enantioselective etherification using readily available oxygen&#8208;based nucleophiles and an amino acid&#8208;derived primary amine catalyst. A survey of benzoquinone oxidants identified p&#8208;fluoranil and DDQ as suitable reaction partners. p&#8208;Fluoranil enables the preparation of &#945;&#8208;aryloxylated aldehydes using phenol nucleophiles in up to 91&#8201;% ee, following either a one&#8208;step or a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot protocol. DDQ allows for a more general etherification protocol in combination with a broader range of alcohol nucleophiles with enantioselectivities up to 95&#8201;% ee. Control experiments and isolation of a key quinol intermediate supports a mechanism proceeding via an SN2 dynamic&#8208;kinetic resolution. These studies provide the basis for an aminocatalytic umpolung concept that allows for the asymmetric construction of tertiary ethers in the &#945;&#8208;position of aldehydes.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Driven Synergistically Enhanced Hyperpolarizability: Chiral Coordination Polymers with Nonpolar Structures Exhibiting Unusually Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematically synthesized new noncentrosymmetric nonpolar chiral coordination polymers exhibit unusually strong second&#8208;harmonic generation efficiencies attributable to the synergistic effect of polarizable metal cations and increased hyperpolarizability in the donor&#8211;acceptor system originating from the robust hydrogen bonding in the coordinated linkers.







Abstract
Four chiral coordination polymers (CPs), M[(S,S)&#8208;C14H14N2O6] and M[(R,R)&#8208;C14H14N2O6] (M=Zn or Cd), have been exclusively synthesized in high yields with the aid of newly designed chiral ligand under hydrothermal condition. The CPs crystallizing in the orthorhombic nonpolar space group, C2221, reveal three&#8208;dimensional framework structures composed of MO4 tetrahedra and the corresponding homochiral linkers. Powder second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) measurements indicate that the nonpolar CPs reveal very strong SHG efficiency of ca. 5&#8211;9 times that of KH2PO4 and exhibit type&#8208;I phase&#8208;matching behavior. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the unusually large SHG efficiency found from the nonpolar CPs should be attributable to the synergistic effect of polarizable metal cations and enhanced hyperpolarizability in the donor&#8208;acceptor system originating from the hydrogen bonding in the coordinated linkers.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Adsorbed Carboxylate Ligands on Layered Double Hydroxides/Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Promote the Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), surface&#8208;adsorbed carboxylate ligands on bi/trimetallic layered double hydroxides (LDHs)/MOFs demonstrate a synergistic effect. As a Lewis base the carboxylate ligands promote the sluggish OER by accelerating proton transfer and facilitating adsorption, activation, and dissociation of OH&#8722; ions, while also facilitating intrinsic electron redistribution and a partially distorted octahedral structure.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with carboxylate ligands as co&#8208;catalysts are very efficient for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the role of local adsorbed carboxylate ligands around the in&#8208;situ&#8208;transformed metal (oxy)hydroxides during OER is often overlooked. We reveal the extraordinary role and mechanism of surface&#8208;adsorbed carboxylate ligands on bi/trimetallic layered double hydroxides (LDHs)/MOFs for OER electrocatalytic activity enhancement. The results of X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the carboxylic groups around metal (oxy)hydroxides can efficiently induce interfacial electron redistribution, facilitate an abundant high&#8208;valence state of nickel species with a partially distorted octahedral structure, and optimize the d&#8208;band center together with the beneficial Gibbs free energy of the intermediate. Furthermore, the results of in&#8197;situ Raman and FTIR spectra reveal that the surface&#8208;adsorbed carboxylate ligands as Lewis base can promote sluggish OER kinetics by accelerating proton transfer and facilitating adsorption, activation, and dissociation of hydroxyl ions (OH&#8722;).

Synthesis of tricomponent supramolecular block copolymers with tunable microstructure is demonstrated by a kinetically controlled sequential seeded supramolecular polymerization fluorescent core&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide derivatives.







Abstract
Synthesis of supramolecular block co&#8208;polymers (BCP) with small monomers and predictive sequence requires elegant molecular design and synthetic strategies. Herein we report the unparalleled synthesis of tri&#8208;component supramolecular BCPs with tunable microstructure by a kinetically controlled sequential seeded supramolecular polymerization of fluorescent &#960;&#8208;conjugated monomers. Core&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide (cNDI) derivatives with different core substitutions and appended with &#946;&#8208;sheet forming peptide side chains provide perfect monomer design with spectral complementarity, pathway complexity and minimal structural mismatch to synthesize and characterize the multi&#8208;component BCPs. The distinct fluorescent nature of various cNDI monomers aids the spectroscopic probing of the seeded growth process and the microscopic visualization of resultant supramolecular BCPs using Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM). Kinetically controlled sequential seeded supramolecular polymerization presented here is reminiscent of the multi&#8208;step synthesis of covalent BCPs via living chain polymerization. These findings provide a promising platform for constructing unique functional organic heterostructures for various optoelectronic and catalytic applications.

         <title>Resistance&#8208;Chiral Anisotropy of Chiral Mesostructured Half&#8208;metallic Fe3O4&#160;Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Half&#8208;metallic materials are theoretically predicted to be metallic and insulating, which have not been confirmed experimentally, and the predictions are still in doubt. We report&#160; the&#160; resistance&#8208;chiral anisotropy (R&#8208;ChA), i.e., chirality&#8208;dependent electrical conductivity, in chiral mesostructured Fe  3  O  4  &#160;films (CMFFs)&#160;grown on&#160; the&#160; substrates&#160;  via  &#160;a hydrothermal method using amino acids as symmetry&#8208;breaking agents. Two levels of chirality exist in the CMFFs: primary distortion of the crystal lattice forms twisted nanoflakes, and secondary helical stacking of nanoflakes forms fan&#8208;shaped nanoplates. At temperatures below 30 K, the CMFFs exhibited metallic conductivity and insulation for one handedness and the other, respectively. The chirality&#8208;dependent effective magnetic fields were speculated to stabilize the opposite spin in the antipodal chiral frame , which &#160;led to the free transport of electrons in one handedness of the chiral structure and immobility for the other handedness.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterometal doping is a powerful method for tuning the physicochemical properties of metal nanoclusters. While the heterometals doped into such nanoclusters predominantly include transition metals with closed d&#8208;shells, the doping of open d&#8208;shell metals remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the first synthesis of a [RhHAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722;  nanocluster, in which a Rh atom with open d&#8208;shells ([Kr]4d85s1) is incorporated into the Ag24  framework by forming a RhH superatom with closed d&#8208;shells ([Kr]4d10). Combined experimental and theoretical investigations showed that the Ag24  framework was co&#8208;doped with Rh and hydride and that the RhH dopant was a superatomic construct of a Pd atom. Additional studies demonstrated that the [RhHAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722;  nanocluster was isoelectronic to the [PdAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722;  nanocluster with the superatomic 8&#8208;electron configuration (1S21P6). This study demonstrated for the first time that a superatom could be incorporated into a cluster superatom to generate a stable superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanocluster.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromoselective Synthesis of Sulfonyl Chlorides and Sulfonamides with Potassium Poly(heptazine imide) Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among external stimuli used to promote a chemical reaction, photocatalysis possesses a unique one &#8208; light. Photons are traceless reagents that provide an exclusive opportunity to alter chemoselectivity of the photocatalytic reaction varying the color of incident light. This strategy may be implemented by using a sensitizer capable to activate a specific reaction pathway depending on the excitation light. Herein, we use potassium poly(heptazine imide) (K&#8208;PHI), a type of carbon nitride, to generate selectively three different products from S&#8208;arylthioacetates simply varying the excitation light and otherwise identical conditions. Namely, arylchlorides are produced under UV/purple, sulfonyl chlorides with blue/white, and diaryldisulfides at green to red light. A combination of the negatively charged polyanion, highly positive potential of the valence band, presence of intraband states, ability to sensitize singlet oxygen, and multi&#8208;electron transfer is shown to enable this chromoselective conversion of thioacetates.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emerging CsPbI3 perovskites are highly efficient and thermally stable materials for wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the doped hole transport materials (HTMs) accelerate the undesirable phase transition of CsPbI3 in ambient. Herein, a dopant&#8208;free D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type HTM named CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F has been developed which overcomes this problem. The suitable optoelectronic properties and energy&#8208;level alignment endow CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F with excellent charge collection properties. Moreover, CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F provides multisite defect&#8208;healing effects on the defective sites of CsPbI3 surface. Inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs with CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F HTM feature high efficiencies up to 15.9%, along with 86% efficiency retention after 1000 h under ambient conditions. Inorganic perovskite solar modules were also fabricated that exhibiting an efficiency of 11.0% with a record area of 27 cm2. This work confirms that using efficient dopant&#8208;free HTMs is an attractive strategy to stabilize inorganic PSCs for their future scale&#8208;up.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Electron&#8208;Transfer (PIET) Strategy for Selective Adsorption of CO2 over C2H2 in a MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using porous materials is a promising technique but a great challenge to achieve high CO2/C2H2 uptake ratio. This work has developed a PIET strategy and obtained the second highest CO2/C2H2 adsorption ratio for porous materials. These findings will promote the development of a new generation of CO2&#8208;selective adsorption technique in C2H2 production and inspire design and synthesis of porous materials for high efficient gas adsorption and separation.







Abstract
Similarities in sizes, shapes, and physical properties between carbon dioxide (CO2) and acetylene (C2H2) make it a great challenge to separate the major impurity CO2 from products in C2H2 production. The use of porous materials is an appealing path to replace current very costly and energy&#8208;consuming technologies, such as solvent extraction and cryogenic distillation; however, high CO2/C2H2 uptake ratio with minor adsorption of C2H2 at standard pressure was only unexpectedly observed in scarce examples in recent years although the related research started early at 1950s, and general design strategies to realize this aim are still absent. This work has successfully developed an efficient PIET strategy and obtained the second highest CO2/C2H2 adsorption ratio for porous materials in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept MOF with a photochromism&#8208;active bipyridinium zwitterion. An unprecedented photocontrollable gate effect, owing to change of interannular dihedral after photoinduced generation of radical species, was also observed for the first time.

     alt="Photoinduced Electron-Transfer (PIET) Strategy for Selective Adsorption of CO2 over C2H2 in a MOF"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using porous materials is a promising technique but a great challenge to achieve high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake ratio. This work has developed a PIET strategy and obtained the second highest CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption ratio for porous materials. These findings will promote the development of a new generation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-selective adsorption technique in C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production and inspire design and synthesis of porous materials for high efficient gas adsorption and separation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarities in sizes, shapes, and physical properties between carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and acetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) make it a great challenge to separate the major impurity CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from products in C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. The use of porous materials is an appealing path to replace current very costly and energy-consuming technologies, such as solvent extraction and cryogenic distillation; however, high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake ratio with minor adsorption of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at standard pressure was only unexpectedly observed in scarce examples in recent years although the related research started early at 1950s, and general design strategies to realize this aim are still absent. This work has successfully developed an efficient PIET strategy and obtained the second highest CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption ratio for porous materials in a proof-of-concept MOF with a photochromism-active bipyridinium zwitterion. An unprecedented photocontrollable gate effect, owing to change of interannular dihedral after photoinduced generation of radical species, was also observed for the first time. These findings will inspire design and synthesis of porous materials for high efficient gas adsorption and separation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Polysulfates Block SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Uptake through Electrostatic Interactions**
</title>

Negatively charged polysulfates can bind to the positively charged patches of RBD of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and block viral interaction with host cells for infection inhibition. The synthetic linear polyglycerol sulfate (LPGS) exhibits higher virus inhibitory activity than heparin, but lower anticoagulant activity. Therefore, it is considered to be a promising substitute for heparin in clinical applications.







Abstract
Here we report that negatively charged polysulfates can bind to the spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 via electrostatic interactions. Using a plaque reduction assay, we compare inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by heparin, pentosan sulfate, linear polyglycerol sulfate (LPGS) and hyperbranched polyglycerol sulfate (HPGS). Highly sulfated LPGS is the optimal inhibitor, with an IC50 of 67&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 (approx. 1.6&#8197;&#956;m). This synthetic polysulfate exhibits more than 60&#8208;fold higher virus inhibitory activity than heparin (IC50: 4084&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1), along with much lower anticoagulant activity. Furthermore, in molecular dynamics simulations, we verified that LPGS can bind more strongly to the spike protein than heparin, and that LPGS can interact even more with the spike protein of the new N501Y and E484K variants. Our study demonstrates that the entry of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 into host cells can be blocked via electrostatic interactions, therefore LPGS can serve as a blueprint for the design of novel viral inhibitors of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Methane&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol on Mononuclear Copper(II) Sites Supported on Al2O3: Structure of Active Sites from Electron Paramagnetic Resonance**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16200-16207, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;dispersed CuII sites generated on transition alumina using a molecular approach were employed in the stepwise partial oxidation of methane to methanol. The reactive CuII centers could be identified spectroscopically due to their unique EPR signature. A structure for these unusual CuII monomers, working in pairs, was proposed based on advanced spectroscopic characterization, reactivity studies, and DFT modeling.







Abstract
The selective conversion of methane to methanol remains one of the holy grails of chemistry, where Cu&#8208;exchanged zeolites have been shown promote this reaction under stepwise conditions. Over the years, several active sites have been proposed, ranging from mono&#8208;, di&#8208; to trimeric CuII. Herein, we report the formation of well&#8208;dispersed monomeric CuII species supported on alumina using surface organometallic chemistry and their reactivity towards the selective and stepwise conversion of methane to methanol. Extensive studies using various transition alumina supports combined with spectroscopic characterization, in particular electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), show that the active sites are associated with specific facets, which are typically found in &#947;&#8208; and &#951;&#8208;alumina phase, and that their EPR signature can be attributed to species having a tri&#8208;coordinated [(Al2O)CuIIO(OH)]&#8722; T&#8208;shape geometry. Overall, the selective conversion of methane to methanol, a two&#8208;electron process, involves two monomeric CuII sites that play in concert.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Azide&#8211;Thioalkyne Cycloaddition Catalyzed by Photoactivatable Ruthenium(II) Complexes</title>

Tailored cationic RuII complexes are highly effective precatalysts for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;thioalkyne cycloaddition (see scheme). These reactions can now be carried out under very dilute conditions and in complex biorelevant media; they are also compatible with and mutually orthogonal to CuAAC. Moreover, ruthenium&#8211;arene sandwich complexes function as photoactivatable precatalysts, providing for temporal control of the reactivity.







Abstract
Tailored ruthenium sandwich complexes bearing photoresponsive arene ligands can efficiently promote azide&#8211;thioalkyne cycloaddition (RuAtAC) when irradiated with UV light. The reactions can be performed in a bioorthogonal manner in aqueous mixtures containing biological components. The strategy can also be applied for the selective modification of biopolymers, such as DNA or peptides. Importantly, this ruthenium&#8208;based technology and the standard copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) proved to be compatible and mutually orthogonal.

The bioinspired, divergent total syntheses of trichodermone and trichoderone A were accomplished from a common biogenetic precursor, aspochalasin Z. Key steps include transannular alkene cyclizations, a singlet oxygen ene reaction, and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) cascade reactions. This approach validates the proposed biosynthetic pathway from a chemical perspective and paves the way for the synthesis and characterization of other cytochalasans.







Abstract
We accomplished the divergent total syntheses of ten pentacyclic cytochalasans (aspergillin PZ, trichodermone, trichoderones, flavipesines, and flavichalasines) from a common precursor aspochalasin&#8197;D and revised the structures of trichoderone&#8197;B, spicochalasin&#8197;A, flavichalasine&#8197;C, aspergilluchalasin based on structure network analysis of the cytochalasans biosynthetic pathways and DFT calculations. The key steps of the syntheses include transannular alkene/epoxyalkene and carbonyl&#8208;ene cyclizations to establish the C/D ring of pentacyclic aspochalasans. Our bioinspired approach to these pentacyclic cytochalasans validate the proposed biosynthetic speculation from a chemical view and provide a platform for the synthesis of more than 400 valuable cytochalasans bearing different macrocycles and amino&#8208;acid residues.

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Nonaflate: A Practical Trifluoromethoxylating Reagent and its Application to the Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Synthesis of Trifluoromethoxylated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16171-16177, July 12, 2021. </description>

Trifluoromethyl nonaflate (TFNf), an odorless liquid (bp 87&#8211;89&#8201;&#176;C), was developed as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, bench&#8208;stable, and reactive trifluoromethoxylating reagent that can be easily and safely prepared in large scale. The synthetic potency of TFNf was demonstrated with the synthesis of various trifluoromethoxylated alkenes, through a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective direct hydro(halo)trifluoromethoxylation of various alkyne derivatives.







Abstract
The trifluoromethoxy group has elicited much interest among drug and agrochemical discovery teams because of its unique properties. We developed trifluoromethyl nonafluorobutanesulfonate (nonaflate), TFNf, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, bench&#8208;stable, reactive, and scalable trifluoromethoxylating reagent. TFNf is easily and safely prepared in a simple process in large scale and the nonaflyl part of TFNf can easily be recovered as nonaflyl fluoride after usage and recycled. The synthetic potency of TFNf was showcased with the underexplored synthesis of various trifluoromethoxylated alkenes, through a high regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydro(halo)trifluoromethoxylation of alkyne derivatives such as haloalkynes, alkynyl esters, and alkynyl sulfones. The synthetic merits of TFNf were further underscored with a high&#8208;yielding and smooth nucleophilic trifluoromethoxylation of alkyl triflates/bromides and primary/secondary alcohols.

         <title>All&#8208;Inorganic Quantum&#8208;Dot LEDs Based on a Phase&#8208;Stabilized &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16164-16170, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable and efficient CsPbI3 perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are demonstrated by resurfacing perovskite with the aid of inorganic ligands (KI). The resurfaced perovskites show a 7&#215; higher phase stability and higher thermal conductivity than in films with organic ligands. The PLEDs exhibit a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;23&#8201;% and a 100&#8208;fold improvement in the operating stability compared to previous EQE devices.







Abstract
The all&#8208;inorganic nature of CsPbI3 perovskites allows to enhance stability in perovskite devices. Research efforts have led to improved stability of the black phase in CsPbI3 films; however, these strategies&#8212;including strain and doping&#8212;are based on organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;capped perovskites, which prevent perovskites from forming the close&#8208;packed quantum dot (QD) solids necessary to achieve high charge and thermal transport. We developed an inorganic ligand exchange that leads to CsPbI3 QD films with superior phase stability and increased thermal transport. The atomic&#8208;ligand&#8208;exchanged QD films, once mechanically coupled, exhibit improved phase stability, and we link this to distributing strain across the film. Operando measurements of the temperature of the LEDs indicate that KI&#8208;exchanged QD films exhibit increased thermal transport compared to controls that rely on organic ligands. The LEDs exhibit a maximum EQE of 23&#8201;% with an electroluminescence emission centered at 640&#8197;nm (FWHM: &#8776;31&#8197;nm). These red LEDs provide an operating half&#8208;lifetime of 10&#8197;h (luminance of 200&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2) and an operating stability that is 6&#215; higher than that of control devices.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;N Cross&#8208;Coupling via Kinetic Resolution Enabled by a Bulky and Flexible Chiral N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand</title>

An unprecedented low&#8208;temperature, asymmetric Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of sterically hindered secondary amines with aryl chlorides via kinetic resolution is reported. A bulky yet flexible, chiral NHC ligand enables both low barrier oxidative addition and reductive elimination and high levels of enantiocontrol. Computational studies indicate that multiple &#963;&#8208;bond rotations of the C2&#8208;symmetric chiral NHC adapt to the changing needs of catalytic processes.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling has revolutionized the construction of amines. Despite the innovations of multiple generations of ligands to modulate the reactivity of the metal center, ligands for the low&#8208;temperature enantioselective amination of aryl halides remain a coveted target of catalyst engineering. Designs that promote one elementary reaction often create bottlenecks at other steps. We here report an unprecedented low&#8208;temperature (as low as &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C), enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of aryl chlorides with sterically hindered secondary amines via a kinetic resolution process (s factor up to &gt;300). A bulky yet flexible chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand is leveraged to drive both oxidative addition and reductive elimination with low barriers and control the enantioselectivity. Computational studies indicate that the rotations of multiple &#963;&#8208;bonds on the C2&#8208;symmetric chiral ligand adapt to the changing needs of catalytic processes. We expect this design would be widely applicable to diverse transition states to achieve other challenging metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Amplified Interfacial Effect in an Atomically Dispersed RuOx&#8208;on&#8208;Pd 2D Inverse Nanocatalyst for High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction</title>

An atomically dispersed RuOx&#8208;on&#8208;Pd ultrathin 2D inverse nanocatalyst with amplified oxide/metal interface effects may serve as an excellent Pt&#8208;alternative cathode electrocatalyst for fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed oxide&#8208;on&#8208;metal inverse nanocatalysts provide a blueprint to amplify the strong oxide&#8211;metal interactions for heterocatalysis but remain a grand challenge in fabrication. Here we report a 2D inverse nanocatalyst, RuOx&#8208;on&#8208;Pd nanosheets, by in situ creating atomically dispersed RuOx/Pd interfaces densely on ultrathin Pd nanosheets via a one&#8208;pot synthesis. The product displays unexpected performance toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium, which represents 8.0&#8208; and 22.4&#8208;fold enhancement in mass activity compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts, respectively, showcasing an excellent Pt&#8208;alternative cathode electrocatalyst for fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. Density functional theory calculations validate that the RuOx/Pd interface can accumulate partial charge from the 2D Pd host and subtly change the adsorption configuration of O2 to facilitate the O&#8722;O bond cleavage. Meanwhile, the d&#8208;band center of Pd nanosubstrates is effectively downshifted, realizing weakened oxygen binding strength.

We demonstrated that the delicate mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint was precisely mimicked to construct a mechanically interlocked network (MIN), which simultaneously integrates incompatible mechanical adaptivity, robustness, and dynamic stability in a single system.







Abstract
Mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joints have been widely used for thousands of years in wooden architectures in virtue of their artistic and functional performance. However, imitation of similar structural and mechanical design philosophy to construct mechanically adaptive materials at the molecular level is a challenge. Herein, we report a mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint inspired mechanically interlocked network (MIN), in which the [2]rotaxane crosslink not only mimics the joint in structure, but also reproduces its function in modifying mechanical properties of the MIN. Benefiting from the hierarchical energy dissipative ability along with the controllable intramolecular movement of the mechanically interlocked crosslink, the resultant MIN simultaneously exhibits notable mechanical adaptivity and structural stability in a single system, as manifested by decent stiffness, strength, toughness, and deformation recovery capacity.

         <title>A Family of Nonribosomal Peptides Modulate Collective Behavior in Pseudovibrio Bacteria Isolated from Marine Sponges**

Pseudovibrio are &#945;&#8208;proteobacteria proposed to contribute to marine sponge health. Lack of reverse genetics have hindered exploration of the ecological and biotechnological potential of Pseudovibrio. Here we describe reverse genetics methods that enabled identification of 12 pseudovibriamides, which we show affect motility and biofilm behavior of Pseudovibrio.







Abstract
Although swarming motility and biofilms are opposed collective behaviors, both contribute to bacterial survival and host colonization. Pseudovibrio bacteria have attracted attention because they are part of the microbiome of healthy marine sponges. Two&#8208;thirds of Pseudovibrio genomes contain a member of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#8208;polyketide synthase gene cluster family, which is also found sporadically in Pseudomonas pathogens of insects and plants. After developing reverse genetics for Pseudovibrio, we isolated heptapeptides with an ureido linkage and related nonadepsipeptides we termed pseudovibriamides&#8197;A and B, respectively. A combination of genetics and imaging mass spectrometry experiments showed heptapetides were excreted, promoting motility and reducing biofilm formation. In contrast to lipopeptides widely known to affect motility/biofilms, pseudovibriamides are not surfactants. Our results expand current knowledge on metabolites mediating bacterial collective behavior.

         <title>Exceptional Electrochemical HER Performance with Enhanced Electron Transfer between Ru Nanoparticles and Single Atoms Dispersed on a Carbon Substrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16044-16050, July 12, 2021. </description>

Carbon&#8208;based substrates with an inert surface provide weak metal&#8211;support interactions that are insufficient to effectively modulate the electronic structures of the loaded metal nanoparticles. Here we show that atomic metal species on the carbon substrate can remotely communicate with the supported metal nanoparticles, inducing synergistic electronic coupling with the nanoparticles and enabling the control of their electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Precisely regulating the electronic structures of metal active species is highly desirable for electrocatalysis. However, carbon with inert surface provide weak metal&#8211;support interaction, which is insufficient to modulate the electronic structures of metal nanoparticles. Herein, we propose a new method to control the electrocatalytic behavior of supported metal nanoparticles by dispersing single metal atoms on an O&#8208;doped graphene. Ideal atomic metal species are firstly computationally screened. We then verify this concept by deposition of Ru nanoparticles onto an O&#8208;doped graphene decorated with single metal atoms (e.g., Fe, Co, and Ni) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Consistent with theoretical predictions, such hybrid catalysts show outstanding HER performance, much superior to other reported electrocatalysts such as the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C. This work offers a new strategy for modulating the activity and stability of metal nanoparticles for electrocatalysis processes.

         <title>Folded Perylene Diimide Loops as Mechanoresponsive Motifs</title>

Two perylene diimides are combined to form a loop that acts as a supramolecular mechanophore. Mechanical deformation of polymers featuring this mechanophore triggers an instant, visually discernible, and reversible fluorescence color change that linearly correlates with the applied strain.







Abstract
A supramolecular mechanophore that can be integrated into polymers and indicates deformation by a fluorescence color change is reported. Two perylene diimides (PDIs) were connected by a short spacer and equipped with peripheral atom transfer polymerization initiators. In the idle state, the motif folds into a loop and its emission is excimer dominated. Poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) chains were grown from the motif and the mechanophore&#8208;containing polymer was blended with unmodified PMA to afford materials that display a visually discernible fluorescence color change upon deformation, which causes the loops to unfold. The response is instant, and correlates linearly with the applied strain. Experiments with a reference polymer containing only one PDI moiety show that looped mechanophores that display intramolecular excimer formation offer considerable advantages over intermolecular dye aggregates, including a concentration&#8208;independent response, direct signaling of mechanical processes, and a more pronounced optical change.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral S&#8208;nitrosation Mediated by a Dicopper Center</title>

A redox&#8208;neutral S&#8208;nitrosation of thiol has been achieved at a dicopper(I,I) center. This redox&#8208; and proton&#8208;neutral S&#8208;nitrosation process is the first functional model of ceruloplasmin in mediating S&#8208;nitrosation of external thiols, with implications for biological copper sites in the interconversion of NO./RSNO.







Abstract
A redox&#8208;neutral S&#8208;nitrosation of thiol has been achieved at a dicopper(I,I) center. Treatment of dicopper (I,I) complex with excess NO. and thiol generates a dicopper (I,I) di&#8208;S&#8208;nitrosothiol complex [CuICuI(RSNO)2]2+ or dicopper (I,I) mono&#8208;S&#8208;nitrosothiol complex [CuICuI(RSNO)]2+, which readily release RSNO in 88&#8211;94&#8201;% yield. The S&#8208;nitrosation proceeds by a mixed&#8208;valence [CuIICuIII(&#956;&#8208;O)(&#956;&#8208;NO)]2+ species, which deprotonates RS&#8208;H at the basic &#956;&#8208;O site and nitrosates RS&#8722; at the &#956;&#8208;NO site. The [CuIICuIII(&#956;&#8208;O)(&#956;&#8208;NO)]2+ complex is also competent for O&#8208;nitrosation of MeOH. A rare [CuIICuII(&#956;&#8208;NO)(OMe)]2+ intermediate was isolated and fully characterized, suggesting the S&#8208;nitrosation may proceed through the intermediary of analogous [CuIICuII(&#956;&#8208;NO)(SR)]2+ species. This redox&#8208; and proton&#8208;neutral S&#8208;nitrosation process is the first functional model of ceruloplasmin in mediating S&#8208;nitrosation of external thiols, with implications for biological copper sites in the interconversion of NO./RSNO.

A rare [Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(&#956;-NO)(OMe)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; intermediate was isolated and fully characterized, suggesting the &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-nitrosation may proceed through the intermediary of analogous [Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(&#956;-NO)(SR)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; species. This redox- and proton-neutral &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-nitrosation process is the first functional model of ceruloplasmin in mediating &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-nitrosation of external thiols, with implications for biological copper sites in the interconversion of NO&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;/RSNO.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Impact of Electrostatic Interaction on Bulk Morphology in Efficient Donor&#8211;Acceptor Photovoltaic Blends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15988-15994, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fine&#8208;tuning the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution of photoactive materials, the morphology of donor:acceptor (D:A) photovoltaic films can be effectively adjusted. A large D:A ESP difference is required to assist charge generation, but too large ESP difference may result in additional nonradiative recombination loss and lead to hypermiscibility issues.







Abstract
Bulk heterojunctions comprising mixed donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials have proven to be the most efficient device structures for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. The bulk morphology of such cells plays a key role in charge generation, recombination, and transport, thus determining the device performance. Although numerous studies have discussed the morphology&#8208;performance relationship of these cells, the method of designing OPV materials with the desired morphology remains unclear. Herein, guided by molecular electrostatic potential distributions, we have established a connection between the chemical structure and bulk morphology. We show that the molecular orientation at the D&#8208;A interface and the domain purity in the blend can be effectively modulated by modifying the functional groups. Enhancing the D&#8208;A interaction is beneficial for charge generation. However, the resulting low domain purity and increased charge transfer ratio in its hybridization with the local excitation states lead to severe charge recombination. Fine&#8208;tuning the bulk morphology can give balanced charge generation and recombination, which is crucial for further boosting the efficiency of the OPV cells.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of a Versatile Double&#8208;Allylation Reagent for Complex Diol Synthesis</title>

Make it a double: A strategy for the synthesis of novel double&#8208;allylation reagents based on the alkenylboration of alkenylboronates is presented. The ease and modularity with which the reagents can be prepared allows rapid access to a variety of complex diol motifs. In the context of these studies, we also demonstrate the first examples of the use of boronamides in allylation reactions.







Abstract
Double&#8208;allylation reagents allow for the construction of highly complex molecules in an expedient fashion. We have developed an efficient, modular, and enantioselective approach towards accessing novel variants of these reagents through Cu/Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkenylboration of alkenylboron derivatives. Importantly, we demonstrate novel use of an allylBdan reagent directly in a stereocontrolled allylation without initial deprotection to the boronic ester. These allylation products are employed in a second intermolecular allylation to access complex diol motifs, which has yet to be shown with these types of double&#8208;allylation reagents. Overall, the modularity of this approach and the ease in which complex structural motifs can be accessed in a rapid manner signify the importance and utility of this method.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Selenophene&#8208;Containing Narrow Bandgap Polymer Acceptors for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with over 15&#8201;% Efficiency and High Reproducibility</title>

A novel multi&#8208;selenophene&#8208;containing polymer acceptor PFY&#8208;3Se with a narrow band gap, high electron mobility, and improved intermolecular interaction was developed. In all&#8208;polymer solar cells, batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch insensitive PFY&#8208;3Se obtained an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 15&#8201;% with high reproducibility, which is much better than its analogue, selenophene&#8208;free PFY&#8208;0Se (13.0&#8201;%).







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) progressed tremendously due to recent advances in polymerized small molecule acceptors (PSMAs), and their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have exceeded 15&#8201;%. However, the practical applications of all&#8208;PSCs are still restricted by a lack of PSMAs with a broad absorption, high electron mobility, low energy loss, and good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility. A multi&#8208;selenophene&#8208;containing PSMA, PFY&#8208;3Se, was developed based on a selenophene&#8208;fused SMA framework and a selenophene &#960;&#8208;spacer. Compared to its thiophene analogue PFY&#8208;0Se, PFY&#8208;3Se shows a &#8776;30&#8197;nm red&#8208;shifted absorption, increased electron mobility, and improved intermolecular interaction. In all&#8208;PSCs, PFY&#8208;3Se achieved an impressive PCE of 15.1&#8201;% with both high short&#8208;circuit current density of 23.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and high fill factor of 0.737, and a low energy loss, which are among the best values in all&#8208;PSCs reported to date and much better than PFY&#8208;0Se (PCE=13.0&#8201;%). Notably, PFY&#8208;3Se maintains similarly good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch properties for realizing reproducible device performance, which is the first reported and also very rare for the PSMAs. Moreover, the PFY&#8208;3Se&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs show low dependence of PCE on device area (0.045&#8211;1.0&#8197;cm2) and active layer thickness (110&#8211;250&#8197;nm), indicating the great potential toward practical applications.

         <title>Enhancing Thermocatalytic Activities by Upshifting the d&#8208;Band Center of Exsolved Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe Ternary Alloy Nanoparticles for the Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15912-15919, July 12, 2021. </description>

Ternary Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe nanoparticles were produced by topotactic exsolution. Compared bimetallic and monometallic catalysts, the ternary Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe catalyst exhibited enhanced catalytic activity for the dry reforming of methane. DFT calculations indicated the enhanced activity originates from the optimal upshift of the d&#8208;band center of Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe catalyst.







Abstract
Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is a feasible solution to address the reduction of greenhouse gases stipulated by the Paris Climate Agreement, given that it adds value by converting trivial gases, CO2 and CH4, simultaneously into useful syngas. However, the conventional Ni catalyst undergoes deactivation due to carbon coking and particle agglomeration. Here we demonstrate a highly efficient and durable DRM catalyst: exsolved Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe ternary alloy nanoparticles on the layered perovskite PrBaMn1.7Co0.1Ni0.2O5+&#948; produced by topotactic exsolution. This method readily allows the generation of a larger number of exsolved nanoparticles with enhanced catalytic activity above that of Ni monometallic and Co&#8208;Ni bimetallic particles. The enhancement is achieved by the upshift of the d&#8208;band center of Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe relative to those of Co&#8208;Ni and Ni, meaning easier charge donation to the adsorbate. Furthermore, the exsolved catalyst shows exceptional stability, with continuous DRM operation for about 350&#8197;hours.

         <title>Exploiting Reaction&#8208;Diffusion Conditions to Trigger Pathway Complexity in the Growth of a MOF</title>

We show that human&#8208;made self&#8208;assembled materials, such as porous coordination polymers, can follow distinct growth pathways in a given energy landscape in response to a controlled diffusion of reagents.







Abstract
Coordination polymers (CPs), including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), are crystalline materials with promising applications in electronics, magnetism, catalysis, and gas storage/separation. However, the mechanisms and pathways underlying their formation remain largely undisclosed. Herein, we demonstrate that diffusion&#8208;controlled mixing of reagents at the very early stages of the crystallization process (i.e., within &#8776;40&#8197;ms), achieved by using continuous&#8208;flow microfluidic devices, can be used to enable novel crystallization pathways of a prototypical spin&#8208;crossover MOF towards its thermodynamic product. In particular, two distinct and unprecedented nucleation&#8208;growth pathways were experimentally observed when crystallization was triggered under microfluidic mixing. Full&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations also confirm the occurrence of these two distinct pathways during crystal growth. In sharp contrast, a crystallization by particle attachment was observed under bulk (turbulent) mixing. These unprecedented results provide a sound basis for understanding the growth of CPs and open up new avenues for the engineering of porous materials by using out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions.

         <title>A Synthetic Galectin Mimic</title>

A synthetic galectin mimic was designed, synthesized, and shown to bind selectively to n&#8208;octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactoside.







Abstract
Galectins are a galactoside specific subclass of carbohydrate binding proteins (lectins) involved in various cellular activities, certain cancers, infections, inflammations, and many other biological processes. The molecular basis for the selectivity of galectins is well&#8208;documented and revolves around appropriate interaction complementarity: an aromatic residue for C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and polar residues for (charge assisted) hydrogen bonds with the axial hydroxyl group of a galactoside. However, no synthetic mimics are currently available. We now report on the design and synthesis of the first galectin mimic (6), and show that it has a higher than 65&#8208;fold preference for n&#8208;octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;galactoside (8) over n&#8208;octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucoside (7) in CD2Cl2 containing 5&#8201;% [D6]DMSO (with Ka&#8805;4500&#8197;M&#8722;1 for 6:8). Molecular modeling informed by nOe studies reveal a high degree of interaction complementarity between 6 and galactoside 8, which is very similar to the interaction complementarity found in natural galectins.

         <title>Motorized Macrocycle: A Photo&#8208;responsive Host with Switchable and Stereoselective Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16129-16138, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Motorized macrocycles have been successfully synthesized by combining molecular motors with crown ether macrocycles, enabling unique photo&#8208;switchable host&#8211;guest systems controlled by the multi&#8208;stable unidirectional rotation of molecular motors. The switchable chiral cavity can be also used for the enantioselective recognition of guests.







Abstract
Designing photo&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest systems can provide versatile supramolecular tools for constructing smart systems and materials. We designed photo&#8208;responsive macrocyclic hosts, modulated by light&#8208;driven molecular rotary motors enabling switchable chiral guest recognition. The intramolecular cyclization of the two arms of a first&#8208;generation molecular motor with flexible oligoethylene glycol chains of different lengths resulted in crown&#8208;ether&#8208;like macrocycles with intrinsic motor function. The octaethylene glycol linkage enables the successful unidirectional rotation of molecular motors, simultaneously allowing the 1:1 host&#8211;guest interaction with ammonium salt guests. The binding affinity and stereoselectivity of the motorized macrocycle can be reversibly modulated, owing to the multi&#8208;state light&#8208;driven switching of geometry and helicity of the molecular motors. This approach provides an attractive strategy to construct stimuli&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest systems and dynamic materials.

         <title>Enhancing Rechargeable Persistent Luminescence via Organic Dye Sensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15886-15890, July 12, 2021. </description>

A simple dye&#8208;sensitization strategy was discovered to boost the rechargeable persistent luminescence performance of the persistent luminescence nanoparticles. The dye sensitized nanoparticles are used for PersL imaging guided tumorectomy. They provide simultaneous enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;background afterglow intraoperative anatomic tumor navigation and simple microscopic fluorescent cellular imaging.







Abstract
Owing to their unique afterglow ability, long&#8208;wavelength light activatable persistent luminescence (PersL) nanoparticles (PLNPs) have been emerging as an important category of imaging probes. Long&#8208;wavelength LED light has been shown to be effective in recharging these nanoparticles. However, finding a simple and effective method to amplify such renewable PersL signals under long&#8208;wavelength light is still a key challenge. Herein, we discovered that a dye&#8208;sensitization strategy was able to effectively boost the renewable PersL signals of the NIR emitting ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ (ZGC)) under long&#8208;wavelength LED light. Moreover, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle tumorectomy demonstration, this new class of dye sensitized ZGC enabled simultaneous intraoperative anatomic tumor navigation and effective microscopic detection of tumor cells in pathological diagnosis.

         <title>Stable Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells Based on Copper(II/I) Redox Mediators Bearing a Pentadentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16156-16163, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, copper complexes bearing pentadentate ligands, namely [Cu(tpe)]2+/+ and [Cu(tme)]2+/+, have been reported as redox mediators in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells. Strikingly, devices based on [Cu(tme)]2+/+ complexes exhibit an excellent long&#8208;term stability and maintain more than 90&#8201;% of the initial efficiency under continuous illumination, which outperform the reference devices employing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bipyridyl counterpart.







Abstract
In recent years, copper redox mediators have attracted growing interest in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs). However, experiments revealed that ubiquitously used Lewis&#8208;base additives in the electrolytes coordinate to the CuII species, which restricts further enhancement of device performance and stability. We report the application of copper complexes endowed with diamine&#8208;tripyridine pentadentate ligands, [Cu(tpe)]2+/+ (tpe=N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tris(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethylenediamine) and [Cu(tme)]2+/+ (tme=N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tris(6&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethylenediamine), as redox mediators in DSCs. Experimental measurements demonstrate that the coordination environment of Cu(II) complexes with pentadentate ligands remains unchanged in the presence of TBP, which is in stark contrast to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bipyridyl counterpart. DSCs based on [Cu(tme)]2+/+ complexes exhibit an excellent long&#8208;term stability and maintain more than 90&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after 400&#8197;h under continuous illumination, which outperform the reference devices incorporating the bipyridyl counterpart (less than 80&#8201;%) under identical conditions.

Strikingly, devices based on [Cu(tme)]&lt;sup&gt;2+/+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes exhibit an excellent long-term stability and maintain more than 90&#8201;% of the initial efficiency under continuous illumination, which outperform the reference devices employing the state-of-the-art bipyridyl counterpart.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, copper redox mediators have attracted growing interest in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). However, experiments revealed that ubiquitously used Lewis-base additives in the electrolytes coordinate to the Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; species, which restricts further enhancement of device performance and stability. We report the application of copper complexes endowed with diamine-tripyridine pentadentate ligands, [Cu(tpe)]&lt;sup&gt;2+/+&lt;/sup&gt; (tpe=&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-benzyl-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&#8242;,N&#8242;&lt;/i&gt;-tris(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)ethylenediamine) and [Cu(tme)]&lt;sup&gt;2+/+&lt;/sup&gt; (tme=&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-benzyl-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&#8242;,N&#8242;&lt;/i&gt;-tris(6-methylpyridin-2-ylmethyl)ethylenediamine), as redox mediators in DSCs. Experimental measurements demonstrate that the coordination environment of Cu(II) complexes with pentadentate ligands remains unchanged in the presence of TBP, which is in stark contrast to the state-of-the-art bipyridyl counterpart. DSCs based on [Cu(tme)]&lt;sup&gt;2+/+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes exhibit an excellent long-term stability and maintain more than 90&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after 400&#8197;h under continuous illumination, which outperform the reference devices incorporating the bipyridyl counterpart (less than 80&#8201;%) under identical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Protein Labeling and Crosslinking by Covalent Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15899-15904, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleic acid aptamers were developed that are capable of covalently labeling their protein target with a functional molecule. Additionally, with little modification, the aptamer covalently crosslinked to its target instead, thereby inhibiting its function. Covalent aptamers offer a new tool for selective protein modification, detection, and inhibition.







Abstract
We developed a new approach to selectively modify native proteins in their biological environment using electrophilic covalent aptamers. These aptamers are generated through introduction of a proximity&#8208;driven electrophile at specific nucleotide sites. Using thrombin as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate that covalent aptamers can selectively transfer a variety of functional handles and/or irreversibly crosslink to the target protein. This approach offers broad programmability and high target specificity. Furthermore, it addresses issues common to aptamers such as instability towards endogenous nucleases and residence times during target engagement. Covalent aptamers are new tools that enable specific protein modification and sensitive protein detection. Moreover, they provide prolonged, nuclease&#8208;resistant enzyme inhibition.

         <title>Altering Hydrogenation Pathways in Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation by Tuning Local Electronic Structure of Oxygen Vacancy with Dopant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16085-16092, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the local electronic structure of nearby oxygen vacancy by doping enables the control of N2 hydrogenation from the associative alternating pathway to a more favorable associative distal pathway, thus contributing to improved performance for NH3 evolution in photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.







Abstract
To avoid the energy&#8208;consuming step of direct N&#8801;N bond cleavage, photocatalytic N2 fixation undergoing the associative pathways has been developed for mild&#8208;condition operation. However, it is a fundamental yet challenging task to gain comprehensive understanding on how the associative pathways (i.e., alternating vs. distal) are influenced and altered by the fine structure of catalysts, which eventually holds the key to significantly promote the practical implementation. Herein, we introduce Fe dopants into TiO2 nanofibers to stabilize oxygen vacancies and simultaneously tune their local electronic structure. The combination of in&#8197;situ characterizations with first&#8208;principles simulations reveals that the modulation of local electronic structure by Fe dopants turns the hydrogenation of N2 from associative alternating pathway to associative distal pathway. This work provides fresh hints for rationally controlling the reaction pathways toward efficient photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.

Mn(hmds)2 enables clean hydroborations of C=X electrophiles (nitriles, amides, esters, pyridines, carbonates, diimides) at 20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C. The protocol was applied to polymer degradations (polyesters, polycarbonates) and CO2 reduction. Mechanistic studies indicate the catalytic role of MnII hydrides, for example, the isolated cluster [MnH(hmds)]6.







Abstract
Reductive transformations of easily available oxidized matter are at the heart of synthetic manipulation and chemical valorization. The applications of catalytic hydrofunctionalization benefit from the use of liquid reducing agents and operationally facile setups. Metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroborations provide a highly prolific platform for reductive valorizations of stable C=X electrophiles. Here, we report an especially facile, broad&#8208;scope reduction of various functions including carbonyls, carboxylates, pyridines, carbodiimides, and carbonates under very mild conditions with the inexpensive pre&#8208;catalyst Mn(hmds)2. The reaction could be successfully applied to depolymerizations.

Aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission dyes were rationally designed to detect amorphous protein aggregation with controllable sensitivity, color, and cellular performance (see structure). A dimethylaminophenylene group enabled selective binding and fluorescence enhancement, and the emission wavelength could be tuned by altering the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the other ring while retaining selective detection.







Abstract
Unlike amyloid aggregates, amorphous protein aggregates with no defined structures have been challenging to target and detect in a complex cellular milieu. In this study, we rationally designed sensors of amorphous protein aggregation from aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission probes (AIEgens). Utilizing dicyanoisophorone as a model AIEgen scaffold, we first sensitized the fluorescence of AIEgens to a nonpolar and viscous environment mimicking the interior of amorphous aggregated proteins. We identified a generally applicable moiety (dimethylaminophenylene) for selective binding and fluorescence enhancement. Regulation of the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups tuned the emission wavelength while retaining selective detection. Finally, we utilized the optimized probe to systematically image aggregated proteome upon proteostasis network regulation. Overall, we present a rational approach to develop amorphous protein aggregation sensors from AIEgens with controllable sensitivity, spectral coverage, and cellular performance.

         <title>Rotaxane CoII Complexes as Field&#8208;Induced Single&#8208;Ion Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16051-16058, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanically interlocked ligands enable predictable metal ion coordination, offering a new strategy to engineer their properties. A series of field&#8208;induced CoII single&#8208;ion magnets illustrates this principle. The predictable coordination behaviour of the rotaxane enables remarkably accurate calculation of their zero&#8208;field splittings, which are in agreement with experimental observations, and can be rationalized in terms of metal&#8211;ligand bonding.







Abstract
Mechanically chelating ligands have untapped potential for the engineering of metal ion properties. Here we demonstrate this principle in the context of CoII&#8208;based single&#8208;ion magnets. Using multi&#8208;frequency EPR, susceptibility and magnetization measurements we found that these complexes show some of the highest zero field splittings reported for five&#8208;coordinate CoII complexes to date. The predictable coordination behaviour of the interlocked ligands allowed the magnetic properties of their CoII complexes to be evaluated computationally a priori and our combined experimental and theoretical approach enabled us to rationalize the observed trends. The predictable magnetic behaviour of the rotaxane CoII complexes demonstrates that interlocked ligands offer a new strategy to design metal complexes with interesting functionality.

A series of field-induced Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; single-ion magnets illustrates this principle. The predictable coordination behaviour of the rotaxane enables remarkably accurate calculation of their zero-field splittings, which are in agreement with experimental observations, and can be rationalized in terms of metal&#8211;ligand bonding.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanically chelating ligands have untapped potential for the engineering of metal ion properties. Here we demonstrate this principle in the context of Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-based single-ion magnets. Using multi-frequency EPR, susceptibility and magnetization measurements we found that these complexes show some of the highest zero field splittings reported for five-coordinate Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes to date. The predictable coordination behaviour of the interlocked ligands allowed the magnetic properties of their Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes to be evaluated computationally a priori and our combined experimental and theoretical approach enabled us to rationalize the observed trends. The predictable magnetic behaviour of the rotaxane Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes demonstrates that interlocked ligands offer a new strategy to design metal complexes with interesting functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Genetic Encoding and Enzymatic Deprotection of a Latent Thiol Side Chain to Enable New Protein Bioconjugation Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
Enzymatic deprotection of a latent thiol under mild and physiological conditions expands the scope of classic thiol bioconjugation. New reaction schemes enable regioselective labeling and dual modifications for a variety of preparative applications and using the established and commercially available plethora of thiol&#8208;directed reagents.







Abstract
The thiol group of the cysteine side chain is arguably the most versatile chemical handle in proteins. To expand the scope of established and commercially available thiol bioconjugation reagents, we genetically encoded a second such functional moiety in form of a latent thiol group that can be unmasked under mild physiological conditions. Phenylacetamidomethyl (Phacm) protected homocysteine (HcP) was incorporated and its latent thiol group unmasked on purified proteins using penicillin G acylase (PGA). The enzymatic deprotection depends on steric accessibility, but can occur efficiently within minutes on exposed positions in flexible sequences. The freshly liberated thiol group does not require treatment with reducing agents. We demonstrate the potential of this approach for protein modification with conceptually new schemes for regioselective dual labeling, thiol bioconjugation in presence of a preserved disulfide bond and formation of a novel intramolecular thioether crosslink.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Engineered Nano&#8208;Ferroelectrics for High&#8208;Efficiency Piezocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>

Heteroepitaxial strain in BaTiO3 nanoparticles with a designed porous structure is induced by engineering the surface reconstruction, resulting in a significant increase of the BaTiO3 tetragonality and thus its piezoelectricity. Benefiting from high piezoelectricity, the as&#8208;synthesized BaTiO3 nanoparticles possess a superb piezocatalytic overall water&#8208;splitting activity.







Abstract
Developing nano&#8208;ferroelectric materials with excellent piezoelectric performance for piezocatalysts used in water splitting is highly desired but also challenging, especially with respect to reaching large piezo&#8208;potentials that fully align with required redox levels. Herein, heteroepitaxial strain in BaTiO3 nanoparticles with a designed porous structure is successfully induced by engineering their surface reconstruction to dramatically enhance their piezoelectricity. The strain coherence can be maintained throughout the nanoparticle bulk, resulting in a significant increase of the BaTiO3 tetragonality and thus its piezoelectricity. Benefiting from high piezoelectricity, the as&#8208;synthesized blue&#8208;colored BaTiO3 nanoparticles possess a superb overall water&#8208;splitting activity, with H2 production rates of 159&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is almost 130 times higher than that of the pristine BaTiO3 nanoparticles. Thus, this work provides a generic approach for designing highly efficient piezoelectric nanomaterials by strain engineering that can be further extended to various other perovskite oxides, including SrTiO3, thereby enhancing their potential for piezoelectric catalysis.

         <title>The Hole&#8208;Tunneling Heterojunction of Hematite&#8208;Based Photoanodes Accelerates Photosynthetic Reaction</title>

Hole&#8208;tunneling heterojunctions of atomically dispersed RuOx&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;Sn&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanodes were designed rationally to achieve an overall quantum efficiency of 5.7&#8201;% in the all&#8208;solar&#8208;driven APS cells equipped with a Ni&#8208;SNG catalyst cathode for CO2 conversion into syngas with excellent stability for 30&#8197;h under 450&#8197;nm LED irradation.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (SMIS) heterojunctions based on Sn&#8208;doped Fe2O3 nanorods (SF NRs) were designed by combining atomic deposition of an Al2O3 overlayer with chemical grafting of a RuOx hole&#8208;collector for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas conversion. The RuOx&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;SF photoanode with a 3.0&#8197;nm thick Al2O3 overlayer gave a &gt;5&#8208;fold&#8208;enhanced IPCE value of 52.0&#8201;% under 370&#8197;nm light irradiation at 1.2&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl, compared to the bare SF NRs. The dielectric field mediated the charge dynamics at the Al2O3/SF NRs interface. Accumulation of long&#8208;lived holes on the surface of the SF NRs photoabsorber aids fast tunneling transfer of hot holes to single&#8208;atom RuOx species, accelerating the O2&#8208;evolving reaction kinetics. The maximal CO&#8208;evolution rate of 265.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved by integration of double SIMS&#8208;3 photoanodes with a single&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;doped graphene CO2&#8208;reduction&#8208;catalyst cathode; an overall quantum efficiency of 5.7&#8201;% was recorded under 450&#8197;nm light irradiation.

         <title>Segmented Flow Processes to Overcome Hurdles of Whole&#8208;Cell Biocatalysis in the Presence of Organic Solvents</title>

Utilizing tools of segmented flow chemistry enables the conduction of whole&#8208;cell biocatalysis efficiently in biphasic media. Exemplified for different biotransformations with an imine reductase, aldoxime dehydratase, allene oxide synthase and cyclase, the power of flow processes is demonstrated, leading to a 3&#8208;fold increase of conversion as well as a dramatic simplified work&#8208;up and a 1.5&#8208;fold higher yield compared to the analogous batch processes.







Abstract
In modern process development, it is imperative to consider biocatalysis, and whole&#8208;cell catalysts often represent a favored form of such catalysts. However, the application of whole&#8208;cell catalysis in typical organic batch two&#8208;phase synthesis often struggles due to mass transfer limitations, emulsion formation, tedious work&#8208;up and, thus, low yields. Herein, we demonstrate that utilizing segmented flow tools enables the conduction of whole&#8208;cell biocatalysis efficiently in biphasic media. Exemplified for three different biotransformations, the power of such segmented flow processes is shown. For example, a 3&#8208;fold increase of conversion from 34&#8201;% to &gt;99&#8201;% and a dramatic simplified work&#8208;up leading to a 1.5&#8208;fold higher yield from 44&#8201;% to 65&#8201;% compared to the analogous batch process was achieved in such a flow process.

         <title>Benchmark C2H2/CO2 Separation in an Ultra&#8208;Microporous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework via Copper(I)&#8208;Alkynyl Chemistry</title>

Herein, we report the first example of using copper(I)&#8208;alkynyl chemistry in porous MOFs to address the industrially important but challenging C2H2/CO2 separation, wherein the incorporated CuI sites provide the specifically ultra&#8208;strong binding affinity for C2H2 to afford the record&#8208;high C2H2/CO2 selectivity at ambient conditions.







Abstract
Separation of acetylene from carbon dioxide remains a daunting challenge because of their very similar molecular sizes and physical properties. We herein report the first example of using copper(I)&#8208;alkynyl chemistry within an ultra&#8208;microporous MOF (CuI@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(COOH)2) to achieve ultrahigh C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity. The anchored CuI ions on the pore surfaces can specifically and strongly interact with C2H2 molecule through copper(I)&#8208;alkynyl &#960;&#8208;complexation and thus rapidly adsorb large amount of C2H2 at low&#8208;pressure region, while effectively reduce CO2 uptake due to the small pore sizes. This material thus exhibits the record high C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 185 at ambient conditions, significantly higher than the previous benchmark ZJU&#8208;74a (36.5) and ATC&#8208;Cu (53.6). Theoretical calculations reveal that the unique &#960;&#8208;complexation between CuI and C2H2 mainly contributes to the ultra&#8208;strong C2H2 binding affinity and record selectivity. The exceptional separation performance was evidenced by breakthrough experiments for C2H2/CO2 gas mixtures. This work suggests a new perspective to functionalizing MOFs with copper(I)&#8208;alkynyl chemistry for highly selective separation of C2H2 over CO2.

         <title>Single&#8208;Site vs. Cluster Catalysis in High Temperature Oxidations</title>

Metal active sites speciation on Pt&#8208;CHA is discussed for different high&#8208;temperature oxidation reactions, including 16O2/18O2 isotopic exchange experiments, methane combustion, and CO oxidation. Structure&#8211;performance relationships built on subtle changes in the active sites under working conditions are revealed.







Abstract
The behavior of single Pt atoms and small Pt clusters was investigated for high&#8208;temperature oxidations. The high stability of these molecular sites in CHA is a key to intrinsic structure&#8211;performance descriptions of elemental steps such as O2 dissociation, and subsequent oxidation catalysis. Subtle changes in the atomic structure of Pt are responsible for drastic changes in performance driven by specific gas/metal/support interactions. Whereas single Pt atoms and Pt clusters (&gt; ca. 1&#8197;nm) are unable to activate, scramble, and desorb two O2 molecules at moderate T (200&#8201;&#176;C), clusters &lt;1&#8197;nm do so catalytically, but undergo oxidative fragmentation. Oxidation of alkanes at high T is attributed to stable single Pt atoms, and the C&#8208;H cleavage is inferred to be rate&#8208;determining and less sensitive to changes in metal nuclearity compared to its effect on O2 scrambling. In contrast, when combustion involves CO, catalysis is dominated by metal clusters, not single Pt atoms.

Current approved FGFR inhibitors lack selectivity within the FGFR family, which may contribute to their poor tolerability. Here, we describe DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192, a selective FGFR1&amp;2 degrader that destabilized wildtype FGFR1&amp;2 and FGFR2 fusion proteins, had potent anti&#8208;proliferative activity in FGFR2&#8208;dependent cells, and possessed pharmacokinetics properties suitable for in vivo degradation. Thus, FGFR degradation may be a promising therapeutic approach.







Abstract
Aberrant activation of FGFR signaling occurs in many cancers, and ATP&#8208;competitive FGFR inhibitors have received regulatory approval. Despite demonstrating clinical efficacy, these inhibitors exhibit dose&#8208;limiting toxicity, potentially due to a lack of selectivity amongst the FGFR family and are poorly tolerated. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192, a bivalent degrader that couples the pan&#8208;FGFR inhibitor BGJ398 to a CRL2VHL E3 ligase recruiting ligand, which preferentially induces FGFR1&amp;2 degradation while largely sparing FGFR3&amp;4. DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192 exhibited two&#8208;digit nanomolar DC50s for both wildtype FGFR2 and several FGFR2&#8208;fusions, resulting in degradation&#8208;dependent antiproliferative activity in representative gastric cancer and cholangiocarcinoma cells. Importantly, DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192 induced degradation of a clinically relevant FGFR2 fusion protein in a xenograft model. Taken together, we demonstrate that DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192 has potential as a prototype FGFR degrader.

Herein we modulate the perylene skeleton to effect organ&#8208;specificity and present an example of lung&#8208;specific distribution on the basis of a twisted perylene PDIC&#8208;NC. The in vitro and in vivo biological functions of PDIC&#8208;NC are demonstrated and its molecular mechanism for the inhibiting activity on tumour cells is revealed.







Abstract
The systemic use of pharmaceutical drugs for cancer patients is a compromise between desirable therapy and side effects because of the intrinsic shortage of organ&#8208;specific pharmaceutical drug. Design and construction of pharmaceutical drug to achieve the organ&#8208;specific delivery is thus desperately desirable. We herein regulate perylene skeleton to effect organ&#8208;specificity and present an example of lung&#8208;specific distribution on the basis of bay&#8208;twisted PDIC&#8208;NC. We further demonstrate that PDIC&#8208;NC can target into mitochondria to act as cellular respiration inhibitor, inducing insufficient production of adenosine triphosphate, promoting endogenous H2O2 and .OH burst, elevating calcium overload, efficiently triggering the synergistic apoptosis, autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress of lung cancer cells. The antitumor performance of PDIC&#8208;NC is verified on in vivo xenografted, metastasis and orthotopic lung cancer, presenting overwhelming evidences for potentially clinical application. This study contributes a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of twisted perylene to well attain lung&#8208;specific distribution, and meanwhile achieves intensive lung cancer chemotherapy.

         <title>Plastic Waste Conversion over a Refinery Waste Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16101-16108, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the path to finding better catalysts for polyolefin plastic waste conversion to aromatics, we have found that a waste refinery catalyst performed better than the fresh catalyst with decreased accumulation of deactivating carbonaceous deposits. Fluorescence microscopy and vibrational spectroscopy has been used to elucidate the interaction of the polymer with the catalyst and to map the location and type of bulky aromatic species.







Abstract
Polypropylene (PP) makes up a large share of our plastic waste. We investigated the conversion of PP over the industrial Fluid Catalytic Cracking catalyst (FCC&#8208;cat) used to produce gasoline from crude oil fractions. We studied transport limitations arising from the larger size of polymers compared to the crude oil&#8208;based feedstock by testing the components of this catalyst separately. Infrared spectroscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed the role of the FCC matrix in aromatization, and the zeolite Y domains in coking. An equilibrium catalyst (ECAT), discarded during FCC operation as waste, produced the same aromatics content as a fresh FCC&#8208;cat, while coking decreased significantly, likely due to the reduced accessibility and activity of the zeolite domains and an enhanced cracking activity of the matrix due to metal deposits present in ECAT. This mechanistic understanding provides handles for further improving the catalyst composition towards higher aromatics selectivity.

         <title>Electronic&#8208;State Manipulation of Surface Titanium Activates Dephosphorylation Over TiO2 Near Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16149-16155, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate for the first time that TiO2 with a F&#8208;modified (001) surface can activate p&#8208;NPP dephosphorylation near room temperature. The electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of fluorine imposed on the TiO2(001) surface strongly manipulates the electronic state of surrounding Ti5C atoms by making them very acidic, facilitating not only the bidentate adsorption of p&#8208;NPP but also its subsequent activation.







Abstract
Dephosphorylation that removes a phosphate group from substrates is an important reaction for living organisms and environmental protection. Although CeO2 has been shown to catalyze this reaction, cerium is low in natural abundance and has a narrow global distribution (&gt;90&#8201;% of these reserves are located within six countries). It is thus imperative to find another element/material with high worldwide abundance that can also efficiently extract the phosphate out of agricultural waste for phosphorus recycle. Using para&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate (p&#8208;NPP) as a model compound, we demonstrate that TiO2 with a F&#8208;modified (001) surface can activate p&#8208;NPP dephosphorylation at temperatures as low as 40&#8201;&#176;C. By probe&#8208;assisted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), it was revealed that the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of fluorine makes Ti atoms (the active sites) on the (001) surface very acidic. The bidentate adsorption of p&#8208;NPP on this surface further promotes its subsequent activation with a barrier &#8776;20&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 lower than that of the pristine (001) and (101) surfaces, allowing the activation of this reaction near room temperature (from &gt;80&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>A Distannylated Monomer of a Strong Electron&#8208;Accepting Organoboron Building Block: Enabling Acceptor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymers for n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Applications</title>

A distannylated monomer of strong electron&#8208;deficient double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) is readily synthesized and used to develop acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8208;A) type conjugated polymers by Stille polycondensation. The resulting polymers show ultralow LUMO energy levels and can be effectively n&#8208;doped, and thus lead to excellent thermoelectric performance.







Abstract
Acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8208;A) copolymerization is an effective strategy to develop high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymers. However, the development of A&#8208;A type conjugated polymers is challenging due to the synthetic difficulty. Herein, a distannylated monomer of strong electron&#8208;deficient double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit is readily synthesized and used to develop A&#8208;A type conjugated polymers by Stille polycondensation. The resulting polymers show ultralow LUMO energy levels of &#8722;4.4&#8197;eV, which is among the lowest value reported for organoboron polymers. After n&#8208;doping, the resulting polymers exhibit electric conductivity of 7.8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor of 24.8&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. This performance is among the best for n&#8208;type polymer thermoelectric materials. These results demonstrate the great potential of A&#8208;A type organoboron polymers for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type thermoelectrics.

The electron&#8208;rich cyanidometalates [Fe(CN)3]7&#8722; and [Ru(CN)3]7&#8722; represent the first examples of group&#8197;8 elements with an oxidation state of &#8722;IV. DFT calculations reveal a nominal d10s0 configuration, which corresponds to an effective charge of 2&#8722;. The high negative charge also weakens the C&#8722;N bonds by the population of antibonding states.







Abstract
Exceptionally electron&#8208;rich, nearly trigonal&#8208;planar tricyanidometalate anions [Fe(CN)3]7&#8722; and [Ru(CN)3]7&#8722; were stabilized in LiSr3[Fe(CN)3] and AE3.5[M(CN)3] (AE=Sr, Ba; M=Fe, Ru). They are the first examples of group&#8197;8 elements with the oxidation state of &#8722;IV. Microcrystalline powders were obtained by a solid&#8208;state route, single crystals from alkali metal flux. While LiSr3[Fe(CN)3] crystallizes in P63/m, the polar space group P63 with three&#8208;fold cell volume for AE3.5[M(CN)3] is confirmed by second harmonic generation. X&#8208;ray diffraction, IR and Raman spectroscopy reveal longer C&#8722;N distances (124&#8211;128&#8197;pm) and much lower stretching frequencies (1484&#8211;1634&#8197;cm&#8722;1) than in classical cyanidometalates. Weak C&#8722;N bonds in combination with strong M&#8722;C &#960;&#8208;bonding is a scheme also known for carbonylmetalates. Instead of the formal notation [Fe&#8722;IV(CN&#8722;)3]7&#8722;, quantum chemical calculations reveal non&#8208;innocent intermediate&#8208;valent CN1.67&#8722; ligands and a closed&#8208;shell d10 configuration for Fe, that is, Fe2&#8722;.

         <title>Limonin as a Starting Point for the Construction of Compounds with High Scaffold Diversity</title>

Many compound collections used in high&#8208;throughput screening are composed of members whose structural complexity is considerably lower than that of natural products. Here the natural product limonin was leveraged to generate 98 architecturally complex compounds with significant scaffold diversity. Phenotypic screening of the collection led to the discovery of novel anticancer compounds.







Abstract
Structurally complex natural products have been a fruitful source for the discovery and development of new drugs. In an effort to construct a compound collection populated by architecturally complex members with unique scaffolds, we have used the natural product limonin as a starting point. Limonin is an abundant triterpenoid natural product and, through alteration of its heptacyclic core ring system using short synthetic sequences, a collection of 98 compounds was created, including multiple members with novel ring systems. The reactions leveraged in the construction of these compounds include novel ring cleavage, rearrangements, and cyclizations, and this work is highlighted by the discovery of a novel B&#8208;ring cleavage reaction, a unique B/C&#8208;ring rearrangement, an atypical D&#8208;ring cyclization, among others. Computational analysis shows that 52 different scaffolds/ring systems were produced during the course of this work, of which 36 are unprecedented. Phenotypic screening and structure&#8211;activity relationships identified compounds with activity against a panel of cancer cell lines.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Activation of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes and Cyclobutanes: An Alternative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Cleavage Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15928-15934, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrochemical activation of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropanes and D&#8211;A cyclobutanes has been applied for the formal insertion of molecular oxygen into these compounds. C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cleavage of the ring moieties was achieved either by direct anodic electrolysis or by utilizing a DDQ&#8208;assisted electrochemical strategy. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and supportive experiments provided mechanistic understanding of the electrocatalytic process.







Abstract
We describe the first electrochemical activation of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes and D&#8211;A cyclobutanes leading after C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cleavage to the formation of highly reactive radical cations. This concept is utilized to formally insert molecular oxygen after direct or DDQ&#8208;assisted anodic oxidation of the strained carbocycles, delivering &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;hydroxy ketones and 1,2&#8208;dioxanes electrocatalytically. Furthermore, insights into the mechanism of the oxidative process, obtained experimentally and by additional quantum&#8208;chemical calculations are presented. The synthetic potential of the reaction products is demonstrated by diverse derivatizations.

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;Based Hydrogen Sulfide Nanomotors Induce Multiple Acidosis in Tumor Cells by Destroying Tumor Metabolic Symbiosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16139-16148, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the chemical reaction in a tumor environment, L&#8208;cysteine can be catalyzed by cystathionine &#946;&#8208;synthase in the tumor microenvironment to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and L&#8208;serine, to construct a H2S&#8208;driven nanomotor. The nanomotors can move in the tumor microenvironment, destroy tumor metabolic symbiosis and inhibit tumor growth specifically.







Abstract
Destruction of tumor metabolism symbiosis is an attractive cancer treatment method which targets tumor cells with little harm to normal cells. Yet, a single intervention strategy and poor penetration of the drug in tumor tissue result in limited effect. Herein, we propose a zero&#8208;waste zwitterion&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S)&#8208;driven nanomotor based on the basic principle of reaction in human body. When loaded with monocarboxylic acid transporter inhibitor &#945;&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxycinnamic acid (&#945;&#8208;CHCA), the nanomotor can move in tumor microenvironment and induce multiple acidosis of tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth through the synergistic effect of motion effect, driving force H2S and &#945;&#8208;CHCA. Given the good biosafety of the substrate and driving gas of this kind of nanomotor, as well as the limited variety of nanomotors currently available to move in the tumor microenvironment, this kind of nanomotor may provide a competitive candidate for the active drug delivery system of cancer treatment.

         <title>Isomeric Dibenzoheptazethrenes for Air&#8208;Stable Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16230-16236, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dibenzoheptazethrene isomers with low diradical character, large singlet&#8211;triplet gaps, and narrow energy gaps were synthesized. Both compounds exhibited remarkably high stability, which allowed for the fabrication of single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors in air. A hole mobility of up to 0.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 was obtained with good bias&#8208;stress and storage stability.







Abstract
Singlet diradicaloids hold great potential as semiconductors for organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). However, their relative low material and device stabilities impede the practical applications. Here, to achieve balanced stability and performance, two isomeric dibenzoheptazethrene derivatives with singlet diradical character were synthesized in a concise manner. Benefitting from the aromatic stabilization, both compounds display a small diradical character and large singlet&#8211;triplet gap, as corroborated by variable&#8208;temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, single&#8208;crystal analysis, and theoretical calculations. OFET devices based on single crystals showed a high hole mobility of 0.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is the highest for zethrene&#8208;based semiconductors. Both isomers exhibited remarkable material stability in air&#8208;saturated solutions as well as excellent bias&#8208;stress and storage stability in device under ambient air.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Long&#8208;Lived Triplet Excited State in Water at Room Temperature: Insights on the Molecular Design of Tridecafullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 16109-16118, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented ultra&#8208;long&#8208;lived triplet excited state (93&#8197;ms in water at 25&#8201;&#176;C) has been measured for a globular glycodendrimeric tridecafullerene. The photophysics of S1 and T1, T1 quenching by O2 and N3&#8722;, and molecular modelling provide unequivocal evidence of the role played by the molecular design of the spacers connecting the core&#8211;shell C60 units and the C60&#8208;sugars on the degree of water solvation and its effect on this remarkable finding.







Abstract
Suitably engineered molecular systems exhibiting triplet excited states with very long lifetimes are important for high&#8208;end applications in nonlinear optics, photocatalysis, or biomedicine. We report the finding of an ultra&#8208;long&#8208;lived triplet state with a mean lifetime of 93&#8197;ms in an aqueous phase at room temperature, measured for a globular tridecafullerene with a highly compact glycodendrimeric structure. A series of three tridecafullerenes bearing different glycodendrons and spacers to the C60 units have been synthesized and characterized. UV/Vis spectra and DLS experiments confirm their aggregation in water. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence experiments suggest a different degree of inner solvation of the multifullerenes depending on their molecular design. Efficient quenching of the triplet states by O2 but not by waterborne azide anions has been observed. Molecular modelling reveals dissimilar access of the aqueous phase to the internal structure of the tridecafullerenes, differently shielded by the glycodendrimeric shell.

We report the finding of an ultra-long-lived triplet state with a mean lifetime of 93&#8197;ms in an aqueous phase at room temperature, measured for a globular tridecafullerene with a highly compact glycodendrimeric structure. A series of three tridecafullerenes bearing different glycodendrons and spacers to the C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; units have been synthesized and characterized. UV/Vis spectra and DLS experiments confirm their aggregation in water. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence experiments suggest a different degree of inner solvation of the multifullerenes depending on their molecular design. Efficient quenching of the triplet states by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but not by waterborne azide anions has been observed. Molecular modelling reveals dissimilar access of the aqueous phase to the internal structure of the tridecafullerenes, differently shielded by the glycodendrimeric shell.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Fabrication and Atomic&#8208;Scale Characterization of Triply Linked, Laterally &#960;&#8208;Extended Porphyrin Nanotapes**
</title>

Herein, we describe the first on&#8208;surface preparation of porphyrin nanotapes (Por NTs) on a gold surface. Structural and electronic characterization reveals that the Por NTs carry one unpaired electron at each end, which leads to magnetic end states. This study provides an alternative and versatile route to the fabrication of Por NTs and a detailed atomic&#8208;scale characterization of their structural and electronic properties.







Abstract
Porphyrin nanotapes (Por NTs) are promising structures for their use as molecular wires thanks to a high degree of &#960;&#8208;conjugation, low HOMO&#8212;LUMO gaps, and exceptional conductance. Such structures have been prepared in solution, but their on&#8208;surface synthesis remains unreported. Here, meso&#8211;meso triply fused Por NTs have been prepared through a two&#8208;step synthesis on Au(111). The diradical character of the on&#8208;surface formed building block PorA2, a phenalenyl &#960;&#8208;extended ZnIIPor, facilitates intermolecular homocoupling and allows for the formation of laterally &#960;&#8208;extended tapes. The structural and electronic properties of individual Por NTs are addressed, both on Au(111) and on a thin insulating NaCl layer, by high&#8208;resolution scanning probe microscopy/spectroscopy complemented by DFT calculations. These Por NTs carry one unpaired electron at each end, which leads to magnetic end states. Our study provides a versatile route towards Por NTs and the atomic&#8208;scale characterization of such tapes.

         <title>Identification of Kinetic and Spectroscopic Signatures of Copper Sites for Direct Oxidation of Methane to Methanol</title>

Kinetic and spectroscopic signatures of dimeric and monomeric copper species hosted in mordenite and reacting with methane have been identified.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;exchanged zeolites of different topologies possess high activity in the direct conversion of methane to methanol via the chemical looping approach. Despite a large number of studies, identification of the active sites, and especially their intrinsic kinetic characteristics remain incomplete and ambiguous. In the present work, we collate the kinetic behavior of different copper species with their spectroscopic identities and track the evolution of various copper motifs during the reaction. Using time&#8208;resolved UV/Vis and in situ EPR, XAS, and FTIR spectroscopies, two types of copper monomers were identified, one of which is active in the reaction with methane, in addition to a copper dimeric species with the mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo structure. Kinetic measurements showed that the reaction rate of the copper monomers is somewhat slower than that of the dicopper mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo species, while the activation energy is two times lower.

         <title>Exploring Structure and Function of Redox Intermediates in [NiFe]&#8208;Hydrogenases by an Advanced Experimental Approach for Solvated, Lyophilized and Crystallized Metalloenzymes</title>

A multifunctional setup for in situ spectroscopy on gas&#8208;processing metalloenzymes enables the controlled preparation of redox states in various sample forms. This setup allowed the first NRVS characterization of the Nia&#8722;C state of [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenases, provided new insights into the reductive activation of these enzymes, and revealed a so&#8208;far unknown redox state of the oxygen&#8208;tolerant membrane&#8208;bound hydrogenase from R.&#8197;eutropha.







Abstract
To study metalloenzymes in detail, we developed a new experimental setup allowing the controlled preparation of catalytic intermediates for characterization by various spectroscopic techniques. The in situ monitoring of redox transitions by infrared spectroscopy in enzyme lyophilizate, crystals, and solution during gas exchange in a wide temperature range can be accomplished as well. Two O2&#8208;tolerant [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenases were investigated as model systems. First, we utilized our platform to prepare highly concentrated hydrogenase lyophilizate in a paramagnetic state harboring a bridging hydride. This procedure proved beneficial for 57Fe nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy and revealed, in combination with density functional theory calculations, the vibrational fingerprint of this catalytic intermediate. The same in situ IR setup, combined with resonance Raman spectroscopy, provided detailed insights into the redox chemistry of enzyme crystals, underlining the general necessity to complement X&#8208;ray crystallographic data with spectroscopic analyses.

         <title>Introduction of a Luminophore into Generic Polymers via Mechanoradical Coupling with a Prefluorescent Reagent</title>

Polymeric mechanoradicals were formed in situ under ball&#8208;milling conditions to undergo radical&#8211;radical coupling with a prefluorescent nitroxide&#8208;based reagent in order to incorporate a luminophore into the polymer main chains via a covalent bond. The method allows the direct and conceptually simple preparation of luminescent polymeric materials from a wide range of generic polymers such as polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, and polyethylene.







Abstract
Herein, we report a novel strategy for introducing a luminophore into generic polymers facilitated by mechanical stimulation. In this study, polymeric mechanoradicals were formed in situ under ball&#8208;milling conditions to undergo radical&#8211;radical coupling with a prefluorescent nitroxide&#8208;based reagent in order to incorporate a luminophore into the polymer main chains via a covalent bond. This method allowed the direct and conceptually simple preparation of luminescent polymeric materials from a wide range of generic polymers such as polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, and polyethylene. These results indicate that the present mechanoradical coupling strategy may help to transform existing commodity polymers into more valuable functional materials.

Firefly&#8208;like persistent luminescence nanoparticles for accurate imaging guided tumor surgery are reported by Gang Han and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;15886. Organic dye molecules act as &#8220;wings&#8221; and can be conjugated with persistent luminescence nanoparticles. Such dye&#8208;sensitized nanoparticles emit boosted afterglow signals for a long period of time without the need for additional light input, reminiscent of a firefly.

Divergent syntheses of a series of bioactive pentacyclic cytochalasans are reported by Pema&#8208;Tenzin Puno, Jun Deng, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;15963. Inspired by nature's way of synthesizing various secondary metabolites from a common precursor to maximize the number of natural products, total synthesis and structure revision of pentacyclic cytochalasans were realized from a common precursor aspochalasin&#8197;D based on bioinspired structure network analysis and DFT calculations.

         <title>Innovative Synthetic Procedures for Luminogens Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15724-15742, July 12, 2021. </description>

Innovative synthetic procedures involving transition metals, acid, or base are being rapidly developed for the facile synthesis of a diverse range of luminogens that show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIEgens). These emerging synthetic possibilities will enable AIEgens to be used in a wealth of multidisciplinary applications.







Abstract
As a consequence of their intrinsic advantageous properties, luminogens that show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIEgens) have received increasing global interest for a wide range of applications. Whereas general synthetic methods towards AIEgens largely rely on tedious procedures and limited reaction types, various innovative synthetic methods have now emerged as complementary, and even alternative, strategies. In this Review, we systematically highlight advancements made in metal&#8208;catalyzed functionalization and metal&#8208;free&#8208;promoted pathways for the construction of AIEgens over the past five years, and briefly illustrate new perspectives in this area. The development of innovative synthetic procedures will enable the facile synthesis of AIEgens with great structural diversity for multifunctional applications.

         <title>Advancing the Logic of Chemical Synthesis: C&#8722;H Activation as Strategic and Tactical Disconnections for C&#8722;C Bond Construction</title>

The advent of new synthetic methods has historically motivated the evolution of retrosynthetic logic. A significant recent advance is C&#8722;C bond formation enabled by C&#8722;H activation, but it has only seen modest application in synthesis. This Review compares traditional synthetic routes towards complex targets with reconceptualized ones utilizing C&#8722;H activation, highlighting the strategic advantages of this powerful approach.







Abstract
The design of synthetic routes by retrosynthetic logic is decisively influenced by the transformations available. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation has emerged as a powerful strategy for C&#8722;C bond formation, with myriad methods developed for diverse substrates and coupling partners. However, its uptake in total synthesis has been tepid, partially due to their apparent synthetic intractability, as well as a lack of comprehensive guidelines for implementation. This Review addresses these issues and offers a guide to identify retrosynthetic opportunities to generate C&#8722;C bonds by C&#8722;H activation processes. By comparing total syntheses accomplished using traditional approaches and recent C&#8722;H activation methods, this Review demonstrates how C&#8722;H activation enabled C&#8722;C bond construction has led to more efficient retrosynthetic strategies, as well as the execution of previously unattainable tactical maneuvers. Finally, shortcomings of existing processes are highlighted; this Review illustrates how some highlighted total syntheses can be further economized by adopting next&#8208;generation ligand&#8208;enabled approaches.

         <title>Efficient Aerobic Oxidation of Organic Molecules by Multistep Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15686-15704, July 12, 2021. </description>

Recent progress in aerobic oxidations using electron transfer mediators (ETMs) via multistep electron relay is highlighted. The coupled catalytic systems significantly facilitate the transport of the electrons from the reduced substrate&#8208;selective redox catalyst (SSRC) to O2, thereby increasing the efficiency of the aerobic oxidation. This strategy has become powerful and valuable in synthetic organic chemistry.







Abstract
This Minireview presents recent important homogenous aerobic oxidative reactions which are assisted by electron transfer mediators (ETMs). Compared with direct oxidation by molecular oxygen (O2), the use of a coupled catalyst system with ETMs leads to a lower overall energy barrier via stepwise electron transfer. This cooperative catalytic process significantly facilitates the transport of electrons from the reduced form of the substrate&#8208;selective redox catalyst (SSRCred) to O2, thereby increasing the efficiency of the aerobic oxidation. In this Minireview, we have summarized the advances accomplished in recent years in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed as well as metal&#8208;free aerobic oxidations of organic molecules in the presence of ETMs. In addition, the recent progress of photochemical and electrochemical oxidative functionalization using ETMs and O2 as the terminal oxidant is also highlighted. Furthermore, the mechanisms of these transformations are showcased.

Designer hoops: By incorporating aromatic units with specific electronic (i.e. donor/acceptor) or structural (i.e. chirality) properties, it is possible to modify cycloparaphenylenes and conjugated hoops according to design. This Review provides an overview of such structurally designed hoops, their structural, optoelectronic, and host properties, and potential (future) applications.







Abstract
In the last 13&#8197;years several synthetic strategies were developed that provide access to [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) and related conjugated nanohoops. A number of potential applications emerged, including optoelectronic devices, and their use as templates for carbon nanomaterials and in supramolecular chemistry. To tune the structural or optoelectronic properties of carbon nanohoops beyond the size&#8208;dependent effect known for [n]CPPs, a variety of aromatic rings other than benzene were introduced. In this Review, we provide an overview of the syntheses, properties, and applications of conjugated nanohoops beyond [n]CPPs with intrinsic donor/acceptor structure or such that contain acceptor, donor, heteroaromatic or polycyclic aromatic units within the hoop as well as conjugated nanobelts.

         <title>Pseudo Natural Products&#8212;Chemical Evolution of Natural Product Structure</title>

Pseudo&#8208;natural products provide new opportunities in the discovery of bioactive small molecules and can be regarded as a human&#8208;driven chemical evolution of natural product structure.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;natural products (PNPs) combine natural product (NP) fragments in novel arrangements not accessible by current biosynthesis pathways. As such they can be regarded as non&#8208;biogenic fusions of NP&#8208;derived fragments. They inherit key biological characteristics of the guiding natural product, such as chemical and physiological properties, yet define small molecule chemotypes with unprecedented or unexpected bioactivity. We iterate the design principles underpinning PNP scaffolds and highlight their syntheses and biological investigations. We provide a cheminformatic analysis of PNP collections assessing their molecular properties and shape diversity. We propose and discuss how the iterative analysis of NP structure, design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of PNPs can be regarded as a human&#8208;driven branch of the evolution of natural products, that is, a chemical evolution of natural product structure.

We propose and discuss how the iterative analysis of NP structure, design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of PNPs can be regarded as a human-driven branch of the evolution of natural products, that is, a chemical evolution of natural product structure.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Selectivity of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Converted In2O3 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15844-15848, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
15&#8208;nm In2O3 nanocubes as the precatalyst are observed to exhibit greater CO2 reduction selectivity towards formate than bulk&#8208;like samples as well as smaller nanoparticles. This unique size dependence is rationalized as a result of the competition among different reaction pathways, suggesting that smaller is not always better in the catalyst design.







Abstract
The size modulation of catalyst particles represents a useful dimension to tune catalytic performances by impacting not only their surface areas but also local electronic structures. It, however, has remained inadequately explored and poorly elucidated. Here, we report the interesting size&#8208;dependent selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction on In2O3 nanocrystals. 5&#8208;nm nanoparticles and 15&#8208;nm nanocubes with focused size distribution are prepared via a facile solvothermal reaction in oleylamine by carefully controlling a set of experimental parameters. They serve as the precatalysts, and are reduced to In nanocrystals while largely inherit the original size feature during electrochemical CO2 reduction. Catalyst derived from 15&#8208;nm nanocubes exhibits greater formate selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%) at lower overpotential and negligible side reactions compared to bulk&#8208;like samples (indium foil and 200&#8208;nm cubes) as well as the catalyst derived from smaller 5&#8208;nm nanoparticles. This unique size dependence is rationalized as a result of the competition among different reaction pathways by our theoretical computations. Smaller is not always better in the catalyst design.

         <title>Stable Acidic Water Oxidation with a Cobalt&#8211;Iron&#8211;Lead Oxide Catalyst Operating via a Cobalt&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Healing Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15821-15826, July 12, 2021. </description>

The [Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Pb]Ox water oxidation anode catalyst facilitates long&#8208;term O2 evolution reaction in acidic electrolytes at elevated temperatures. Through a cobalt&#8208;selective self&#8208;healing mechanism, this catalyst operates in the absence of dissolved Pb2+ and Fe3+ precursors deeming it a prospective anode material for low&#8208;cost water electrolyzer systems.







Abstract
The instability and expense of anodes for water electrolyzers with acidic electrolytes can be overcome through the implementation of a cobalt&#8208;iron&#8208;lead oxide electrocatalyst, [Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Pb]Ox, that is self&#8208;healing in the presence of dissolved metal precursors. However, the latter requirement is pernicious for the membrane and especially the cathode half&#8208;reaction since Pb2+ and Fe3+ precursors poison the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art platinum H2 evolving catalyst. To address this, we demonstrate the invariably stable operation of [Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Pb]Ox in acidic solutions through a cobalt&#8208;selective self&#8208;healing mechanism without the addition of Pb2+ and Fe3+ and investigate the kinetics of the process. Soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that low concentrations of Co2+ in the solution stabilize the catalytically active Co(Fe) sites. The highly promising performance of this system is showcased by steady water electrooxidation at 80&#177;1&#8201;&#176;C and 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, using a flat electrode, at an overpotential of 0.56&#177;0.01&#8197;V on a one&#8208;week timescale.

         <title>Non&#8208;Planar Perylene Bisimide Analogues with Inserted Carbonyl and Methylene Subunits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15838-15843, July 12, 2021. </description>

The synthesis and properties of perylene bisimide (PBI) analogues with an inserted carbonyl or methylene moiety are described. The carbonyl&#8208;inserted PBI derivative immediately underwent intersystem crossing in its excited state. The deprotonation of the methylene&#8208;inserted PBI derivative afforded the corresponding carbanion, which underwent redox&#8208;induced reversible C&#8722;C bond formation to provide the corresponding &#963;&#8208;dimer almost quantitatively.







Abstract
The synthesis and properties of dinaphthotropone bisimide (DNTrBI) and dinaphthocycloheptatriene bisimide (DNCHepBI) are described. Their molecular design is conceptually based on the insertion of a carbon atom into a perylene bisimide (PBI) core. These molecules adopt non&#8208;planar structures due to the presence of a seven&#8208;membered ring. The PBI derivative into which a carbonyl group was inserted (DNTrBI) immediately underwent nonradiative decay and/or intersystem crossing in its excited state. The PBI derivative into which a methylene group was inserted (DNCHepBI) was susceptible to deprotonation on account of the two electron&#8208;withdrawing naphthalene monoimide units. Subsequent aerobic oxidation resulted in the formation of a C&#8722;C bond at the central methylene unit, thus affording a &#963;&#8208;dimer. The formation of this C&#8722;C bond is dynamically redox&#8208;active, i.e., electron injection into the &#963;&#8208;dimer almost quantitatively regenerated the deprotonated DNCHepBI.

         <title>Engineering a Second&#8208;Order DNA Logic&#8208;Gated Nanorobot to Sense and Release on Live Cell Membranes for Multiplexed Diagnosis and Synergistic Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A smart DNA logic&#8208;gated nanorobot was fabricated, which was able to identify five cell lines and kill target cells by integrating multiaptamers and multiple drugs. Logic&#8208;gated biocomputing was achieved in physiological conditions within 30&#8197;minutes via a single input of one molecule.







Abstract
Tumor biomarker&#8208;based theranostics have achieved broad interest and success in recent years. However, single biomarker&#8208;based recognition can cause false&#8208;positive feedback, including the on&#8208;target off&#8208;tumor phenomenon, in the absence of tumor&#8208;specific antigen. Multibiomarker&#8208;based recognition molecules often elicit nonspecific and undesired internalization when they bind to &#8220;bystander&#8221; cells. We report a universal DNA tetrahedral scaffold (DTS) that anchors on the cell membrane to load multiple aptamers and therapeutics for precise and effective theranostics. This DNA logic&#8208;gated nanorobot (DLGN) not only facilitates precise discrimination among five cell lines, but also triggers synergistic killing of effector aptamer&#8208;tethered synergistic drugs (EASDs) to target cancer cells. Logic&#8208;gated recognition integrated into aptamer&#8208;functionalized molecular machines will prompt fast tumor profiling, in&#8197;situ capture and isolation, and safe delivery of precise medicine.

The three&#8208;step biosynthetic reaction from L&#8208;Val to 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid was reconstituted in vitro. The aziridine synthesis by non&#8208;heme iron and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent oxygenase TqaL, aziridine ring opening by haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase&#8208;type hydrolase TqaF, and oxidative decarboxylation by NovR/CloR&#8208;like non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase TqaM, were characterized. This work presents the first molecular basis for aziridine biogenesis.







Abstract
Aziridine is a characteristically reactive molecule with increased bioactivity due to its strained ring structure. Here, we investigated the biosynthesis of 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) in Penicillium, and successfully reconstituted the three&#8208;step biosynthesis from L&#8208;Val to AIB in vitro. This previously unknown aziridine formation pathway proceeded with the non&#8208;heme iron and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent (FeII/&#945;KG) oxygenase TqaL, followed by aziridine ring opening by the haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase (HAD)&#8208;type hydrolase TqaF, and subsequent oxidative decarboxylation by the NovR/CloR&#8208;like non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase TqaM. Furthermore, the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the C&#8722;N bond forming FeII/&#945;KG oxygenase TqaL was solved at 2.0&#8197;&#197; resolution. This work presents the first molecular basis for aziridine biogenesis, thereby expanding the catalytic repertoire of the FeII/&#945;KG oxygenases. We also report the unique aziridine ring opening by a HAD&#8208;type hydrolase and the remarkable oxidative decarboxylation by a non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase to produce AIB.

         <title>Quantitative Nano&#8208;amperometric Measurement of Intravesicular Glutamate Content and its Sub&#8208;Quantal Release by Living Neurons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15803-15808, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanowire electrochemical biosensor for the quantitative measurement of the intravesicular glutamate (Glu) content inside living neurons and its released fractions was developed. It is shown that only ca. one third to one half of intravesicular Glu molecules are released by individual vesicles during exocytotic events. The sensor opens new possibilities for exploring the regulatory mechanisms of glutamatergic neurotransmission and plasticity.







Abstract
Quantitative measurements of intravesicular glutamate (Glu) and of transient exocytotic release contents directly from individual living neurons are highly desired for understanding the mechanisms (full or sub&#8208;quantal release?) of synaptic transmission and plasticity. However, this could not be achieved so far due to the lack of adequate experimental strategies relying on selective and sensitive Glu nanosensors. Herein, we introduce a novel electrochemical Glu nanobiosensor based on a single SiC nanowire that can selectively measure in real&#8208;time Glu fluxes released via exocytosis by large Glu vesicles (ca. 125&#8197;nm diameter) present in single hippocampal axonal varicosities as well as their intravesicular content before exocytosis. These measurements revealed a sub&#8208;quantal release mode in living hippocampal neurons, viz., only ca. one third to one half of intravesicular Glu molecules are released by individual vesicles during exocytotic events. Importantly, this fraction remained practically the same when hippocampal neurons were pretreated with L&#8208;Glu&#8208;precursor L&#8208;glutamine, while it significantly increased after zinc treatment, although in both cases the intravesicular contents were drastically affected.

         <title>A Promising NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Sensor for Peptide&#8208;Mediated Long&#8208;Term Monitoring of Kidney Dysfunction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15809-15815, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biological metabolism pathways of fluorophores can be altered by elaborately selected hydrophilic peptides. Hepatic cleared organic molecules and fast renal cleared ultrasmall nanoparticles can be retained in the kidney after being conjugated to a peptide with high polarity. Based on the selected peptide, a ROS&#8208;responsive activatable bilateral NIR&#8208;II sensor was designed to detect early kidney injury and report on kidney dysfunctional progression.







Abstract
Kidney disease is usually &#8220;silent&#8221; at the early stage but can lead to severe kidney failure later on. The development of bioimaging probes with rapid distribution and long&#8208;term retention in the kidney is significant for the precise diagnosis of renal diseases. Here, a strategy for the peptide&#8208;mediated delivery and long&#8208;term accumulation (&gt;48&#8197;h) of second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) fluorophores into the kidney is demonstrated. It is shown that both the hepatic&#8208;cleared organic molecules and fast renal&#8208;cleared ultrasmall nanoparticles can be retained in the kidney after conjugation to the peptide with high polarity. Moreover, a ROS&#8208;responsive activatable bilateral NIR&#8208;II sensor was designed based on the kidney targeting peptide, which enables both in&#8197;vivo long&#8208;term kidney monitoring and in&#8197;vitro urine analysis. The capability of the peptide&#8208;based sensor to detect early kidney injury and report on kidney dysfunctional progression is particularly crucial for chemotherapy regimen optimization and timely renoprotective intervention during medication.

         <title>Electrochemical Generation of Hypervalent Bromine(III) Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>
A straightforward electrochemical synthesis of chelation&#8208;stabilized hypervalent bromine(III) compounds is presented. The electrolysis proceeds at room temperature in an undivided cell under galvanostatic conditions, giving &#955;3&#8208;bromanes in good yields on the gram scale from bromoarenes. The reactivity of &#955;3&#8208;bromanes can be enhanced by Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acid additives as demonstrated in &#955;3&#8208;bromane&#8208;mediated oxidative biaryl formation.







Abstract
In sharp contrast to hypervalent iodine(III) compounds, the isoelectronic bromine(III) counterparts have been little studied to date. This knowledge gap is mainly attributed to the difficult&#8208;to&#8208;control reactivity of &#955;3&#8208;bromanes as well as to their challenging preparation from the highly toxic and corrosive BrF3 precursor. In this context, we present a straightforward and scalable approach to chelation&#8208;stabilized &#955;3&#8208;bromanes by anodic oxidation of parent aryl bromides possessing two coordinating hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropanyl substituents. A series of para&#8208;substituted &#955;3&#8208;bromanes with remarkably high redox potentials spanning a range from 1.86&#8197;V to 2.60&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgNO3 was synthesized by the electrochemical method. We demonstrate that the intrinsic reactivity of the bench&#8208;stable bromine(III) species can be unlocked by addition of a Lewis or a Br&#248;nsted acid. The synthetic utility of the &#955;3&#8208;bromane activation is exemplified by oxidative C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bond forming reactions.

KC8 reduction of a hypervalent arsenic heterocycle 4 affords the 1,4&#8208;diarsinine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diide 5 as a red crystalline solid. The C4As2 ring of 5, formally comprising 8&#8197;&#960;&#8208;electrons, is planar and exhibits antiaromatic character. Two&#8208;electron oxidation of 5 with AgOTf gives the 6&#960;&#8208;electron C4As2&#8208;compound 6, which is an aromatic system.

         <title>Synthesis of a Nitrogenase PN&#8208;Cluster Model with [Fe8S7(&#956;&#8208;Sthiolate)2] Core from the All&#8208;Ferric [Fe4S4(Sthiolate)4] Cubane Synthon</title>

A long&#8208;awaited challenging nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster model [{(TbtS)(OEt2)Fe4S3}2(&#956;&#8208;STbt)2(&#956;6&#8208;S)] (2) with two bridging thiolates has been synthesized for the first time from the all&#8208;ferric thiolate iron&#8208;sulfur cubane cluster Fe4S4(STbt)4 (1).







Abstract
Constructing synthetic models of the nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge. Here, we report an optimal nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster model [{(TbtS)(OEt2)Fe4S3}2(&#956;&#8208;STbt)2(&#956;6&#8208;S)] (2) [Tbt=2,4,6&#8208;tris{bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl}phenyl] that is the closest synthetic mimic constructed to date. Of note is that two thiolate ligands and one hexacoordinated sulfide are connecting the two Fe4S3 incomplete cubanes similar to the native PN&#8208;cluster, which has never been achieved. Cluster 2 has been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and relevant physico&#8208;chemical methods. The variable temperature magnetic moments of 2 indicate a singlet ground state (S=0). The M&#246;ssbauer spectrum of 2 exhibits two doublets with an intensity ratio of 3:1, which suggests the presence of two types of iron sites. The synthetic pathway of the cluster 2 could indicate the native PN&#8208;cluster maturation process as it has been achieved from the Fe4S4 cubane Fe4S4(STbt)4 (1).

         <title>Heteroatom Cycloaddition at the (BN)2 Bay Region of Dibenzoperylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 29, Page 15798-15802, July 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first acid&#8208;catalyzed heteroatom cycloaddition at the (BN)2 bay region of a dibenzoperylene with different aldehydes. This new method allows the synthesis of heteroatom&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the formation of 1,3,5,2,4&#8208;oxadiazadiborinane (B2N2CO) rings.







Abstract
Cycloaddition&#8208;dehydration involving a BNBN&#8208;butadiene analogue at the bay region of a dibenzoperylene and a non&#8208;enolizable aldehyde provides a novel strategy for incorporation of the oxadiazadiborinane (B2N2CO) ring into the scaffold of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon resulting in highly emissive compounds.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Dependent Second&#8208;order Nonlinear Optical Effects in 1D Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites Bulk Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of chirality into organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) is expected to achieve excellent photoelectric and nonlinear materials related to circular dichroism. Chirality&#8208;dependent circular photogalvanic effect and spin transport have already been studied in OIHPs. However, chirality&#8208;dependent second harmonic generation (SHG) is rarely studied in bulk single crystal of OIHPs. Due to the existence of asymmetric center and intrinsic chirality in the chiral OIHPs, the different efficiencies of SHG signal occurs when the circularly polarized light (CPL) with different phases passes through the chiral crystal, which is defined as second harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD). Here, the SHG&#8208;CD effect has been successfully developed in bulk single crystals chiral one&#8208;dimensional (1D) [(  R  /  S  )&#8208;3&#8208;aminopiperidine]PbI  4  , which crystallize in a chiral space group  P  2  1  2  1  2  1  . More importantly, it is the first time to distinguish CPL using chirality&#8208;dependent SHG&#8208;CD effect in OIHPs bulk single crystals. Furthermore, such SHG&#8208;CD technology breaks through the conventional CPL detection using chiral semiconductor, thus extending the detection range to near infrared region (NIR). In this way, the anisotropy factor (g  SHG&#8208;CD  ) through SHG&#8208;CD signal is as high as 0.21. The results not only expand the applications of chiral OIHPs in nonlinear optics (NLO) field, but also provide a new method to distinguish the CPL in NIR.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of element&#8208;carbon double bonds is of great importance for the development and understanding of reactive &#960;&#8208;bonded systems in chemistry. The seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic system 4b is readily made by internal C&#8211;H activation at a pendent isopropyl methyl group of the respective [(IPr)C6F5BH]+ borenium ion. Subsequent deprotonation with the IMes carbene gives the neutral cyclic boraalkene system 5b. The B=C double bond in compound 5b adds carbon dioxide, CS2, sulfur dioxide, phenyl isocyanate, an acetylene ester or two NO molecules to give the corresponding four&#8208;membered ring annulated heterocycles. With sulfur or selenium 5b gives the respective three&#8208;membered ring systems. N2O reacts with 5b to give a mixture of the related oxaborinane 18 and a unique [B]OH containing diazoalkane product 19.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbenes and their analogues have constantly enthralled chemists with their intriguing reactivity of ambiphilic character stemming from their electronic structures. Phosphenium and arsenium ions are fiercely reactive cationic species, the stabilization of which has been so far achieved in condensed phase by dispersing the positive charge through electromeric conjugation with at least one electron rich substituent (frequently amido groups). Although observed in gas phase, the isolation of dicoordinate phosphenium and arsenium ions lacking such stabilizing ligands has eluded chemists for decades. Herein we show that by judicious choice of aromatic substituents dicoordinate, donor&#8208;free, Lewis&#8208;superacidic phosphenium and arsenium ions can be kinetically stabilized. They feature singlet electronic ground states possessing a vacant p&#8208;orbital and an electron lone pair with predominantly s&#8208;character.</dc:description>

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for the Efficient Capture and Purification of Propylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorptive separation of propylene/propane (C  3  H  6  /C  3  H  8  ) mixture is highly desired for its potential energy saving on replacing currently deployed and energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation technique. Realizing efficient C  3  H  6  /C  3  H  8  separation in the emerging hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is very challenging and has been rarely reported due to the lack of functional sites for preferential gas binding. By virtue of crystal engineering, we herein report a rare example of functionalized HOF (termed as  HOF&#8208;16  ) with free &#8210;COOH sites for the e&#64259;cient separation of C  3  H  6  /C  3  H  8  mixtures. Under ambient conditions,  HOF&#8208;16  shows a significant C  3  H  6  /C  3  H  8  uptake difference (by 76%) and selectivity (5.4) in contrast to those of other carboxylic acid&#8208;based HOFs. Modeling studies indicate that free &#8210;COOH groups together with the suitable pore confinement facilitate the recognition and high&#8208;density packing of gas molecules. The separation performance of  HOF&#8208;16  has also been validated by breakthrough experiments.  HOF&#8208;16  is stable in harsh condition including strong acidity and water.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanism of Dehydrating Bimodules in trans&#8208;Acyltransferase Polyketide Biosynthesis: A Showcase Study on Hepatoprotective Hangtaimycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bioassay&#8208;guided fractionation led to the isolation of hangtaimycin (HTM) from Streptomyces spectabilis CCTCC M2017417 and the discovery of its hepatoprotective properties. Structure elucidation by NMR suggested the need for a structural revision. A putative HTM degradation product was also isolated and its structure was confirmed by total synthesis. The biosynthetic gene cluster was identified and resembles a hybrid trans&#8208;AT PKS/NRPS biosynthetic machinery whose first PKS enzyme contains an internal dehydrating bimodule, which is usually found split in other trans&#8208;AT PKSs. The mechanisms of such dehydrating bimodules have often been proposed, but have never been deeply investigated. Here we present in vivo mutations and in vitro enzymatic experiments that give first and detailed mechanistic insights into catalysis by dehydrating bimodules.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Alkoxy&#8208; and Hydroxy&#8208;Carbonylations of Functionalized Alkenes Assisted by &#946;&#8208;Carbonyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient asymmetric alkoxy&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;carbonylation of &#946;&#8208;carbonyl functionalized alkenes was developed, providing practical and easy access to various densely functionalized chiral molecules with high optical purity. Control experiments revealed the key role of the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl group in determining the enantioselectivity and promoting the activity as rationalized by DFT calculations.







Abstract
As a fundamental type of carbonylation reaction, the alkoxy&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;carbonylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons constitutes one of the most important industrial applications of homogeneous catalysis. However, owing to the difficulties in controlling multi&#8208;selectivities for asymmetric hydrocarbonylation of alkenes, this reaction is typically limited to vinylarenes and analogues. In this work, a highly efficient asymmetric alkoxy&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;carbonylation of &#946;&#8208;carbonyl functionalized alkenes was developed, providing practical and easy access to various densely functionalized chiral molecules with high optical purity from broadly available alkenes, CO, and nucleophiles (&gt;90 examples, 84&#8211;99&#8201;% ee). This protocol features mild reaction conditions and a broad substrate scope, and the products can be readily transformed into a diverse array of chiral heterocycles. Control experiments revealed the key role of the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl group in determining the enantioselectivity and promoting the activity, which facilitates chiral induction by coordination to the transition metal as rationalized by DFT calculations. The strategy of utilizing an innate functional group as the directing group on the alkene substrate might find further applications in catalytic asymmetric hydrocarbonylation reactions.

Arginine&#8208;specific 1,3&#8208;diketone&#8208;linked reactive nucleotides are reported for the enzymatic construction of DNA probes and cross&#8208;linking with peptides and proteins.







Abstract
Linear or branched 1,3&#8208;diketone&#8208;linked thymidine 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;mono&#8208; and triphosphate were synthesized through CuAAC click reaction of diketone&#8208;alkynes with 5&#8208;azidomethyl&#8208;dUMP or &#8208;dUTP. The triphosphates were good substrates for KOD XL DNA polymerase in primer extension synthesis of modified DNA. The nucleotide bearing linear 3,5&#8208;dioxohexyl group (HDO) efficiently reacted with arginine&#8208;containing peptides to form stable pyrimidine&#8208;linked conjugates, whereas the branched 2&#8208;acetyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;butyl (PDO) group was not reactive. Reaction with Lys or a terminal amino group formed enamine adducts that were prone to hydrolysis. This reactive HDO modification in DNA was used for bioconjugations and cross&#8208;linking with Arg&#8208;containing peptides or proteins (e.g. histones).

         <title>Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxides with Ultra&#8208;Small Micropores for C2 Hydrocarbon Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zeolitic cobalt molybdate was designed and synthesized for C2 hydrocarbon separation. The separation performance was able to be tuned by changing the composition of the material. The material showed good separation performance for C2 hydrocarbon even at high temperatures.







Abstract
Separation of C2 hydrocarbons, C2H6, C2H4, and C2H2, remains significant challenges in chemical industry. However, there are only few adsorbents that can effectively isolate C2 hydrocarbons from their mixtures particularly at a high temperature. Herein, we design a zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on &#1013;&#8208;Keggin polyoxometalates with metal ion linkers. Single gas adsorption of the material shows the different adsorption performances for the C2 hydrocarbons and the strong interaction of the material with the C2 hydrocarbons. Dynamic competitive adsorption experiments show that the material efficiently separates each of the binary C2 hydrocarbon mixtures and even the ternary C2 hydrocarbon mixtures with high selectivity. The material keeps high separation performance even the temperature was increased to 85&#8201;&#176;C. The material is stable and is able to be reused without loss of the separation performance.

         <title>Synergistic Polarization Engineering on Bulk and Surface for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic polarization engineering on bulk and surface of Bi4Ti3O12 is realized by coupling corona poling and surface I&#8208;grafting, which strengthen ferroelectric polarization for facilitating the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers and enrich the reactive sites, largely improving the photocatalytic activity for reducing CO2 in CO.







Abstract
Sluggish charge kinetics and low CO2 affinity seriously inhibit CO2 photoreduction. Herein, the synchronous promotion of charge separation and CO2 affinity of Bi4Ti3O12 is realized by coupling corona poling and surface I&#8208;grafting. Corona poling enhances ferroelectric polarization of Bi4Ti3O12 by aligning the domains direction, which profoundly promotes charge transfer along opposite directions across bulk. Surface I&#8208;grafting forms a surface local electric field for further separating charge carriers and provides abundant active sites to enhance CO2 adsorption. The two modifications cooperatively further increase the ferroelectric polarization of Bi4Ti3O12, which maximize the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges, resulting in an enhanced CO production rate of 15.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (nearly 9 times) with no sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. This work discloses that ferroelectric polarization and surface ion grafting can promote CO2 photoreduction in a synergistic way.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot and Shape&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot, gram&#8208;scale and shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of two covalent organic cages is presented. They can convert into high&#8208;yielding per&#8208;hydroxylated analogues that exhibits great potential for further modification. The [2]cage can be utilized as gas chromatographic stationary phase for high&#8208;resolution separation of benzene/cyclohexane and toluene/methylcyclohexane.







Abstract
Organic cages are fascinating because of their well&#8208;defined 3D cavities, excellent stability, and accessible post&#8208;modification. However, the synthesis is normally realized by fragment coupling approach in low yields. Herein, we report one&#8208;pot, gram&#8208;scale and shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of two covalent organic cages (box&#8208;shaped [4]cage and triangular prism&#8208;shaped [2]cage) in yields of 46&#8201;% and 52&#8201;%, involving direct condensation of triangular 1,3,5&#8208;tris(2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)benzene monomer with paraformaldehyde and isobutyraldehyde, respectively. The cages can convert into high&#8208;yielding per&#8208;hydroxylated analogues. The [2]cage can be utilized as gas chromatographic stationary phase for high&#8208;resolution separation of benzene/cyclohexane and toluene/methylcyclohexane. By changing the central moiety of the triangular monomer and/or aldehyde, this synthetic method would have the potential to be a general strategy to access diverse cages with tunable shape, size, and electronic properties.

         <dc:description>Herein, we report a [5+2] cycloaddition between readily accessible 1&#8208;indanones and internal alkynes through Rh&#8208;catalyzed activation of less strained C&#8722;C bonds. The reaction is enabled by a strongly &#963;&#8208;donating NHC ligand and a carefully modified temporary directing group. A wide range of functional groups is tolerated, and the method provides straightforward access to diverse benzocycloheptenones that are hard to access otherwise. DFT studies of the reaction mechanism imply the migration insertion as the turnover&#8208;limiting step and suggest beneficial &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions in the transition states.</dc:description>

         <title>Recognition of the true and false resonance Raman optical activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) possesses all aspects of a sensitive tool for molecular detection, but its measurement remains challenging. We demonstrate that reliable recording of RROA of chiral colorful compounds is possible, but only after considering the effect of the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) on the ROA spectra induced by the dissolved chiral compound. We show RROA for a number of model vitamin B  12  derivatives that are chemically similar but exhibit distinctively different spectroscopic behavior. The ECD/ROA effect is proportional to the concentration and dependent on the optical pathlength of the light propagating through the sample. It can severely alter relative band intensities and signs in the natural RROA spectra. The spectra analyses are supported by computational modeling based on density functional theory. Neglecting the ECD effect during ROA measurement can lead to misinterpretation of the recorded spectra and erroneous conclusions about the molecular structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective bond cleavage in RAFT agents promoted by low&#8208;energy electron attachment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical polymerization with reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT polymerization) has been successfully applied to generate polymers of well&#8208;defined architecture.&#160; For RAFT polymerization a source of radicals is required. Recent work has demonstrated that for minimal side&#8208;reactions and high spatio&#8208;temporal control these should be formed directly from the RAFT agent or macroRAFT agent (usually carbonothiosulfanyl compounds) thermally, photochemically or by electrochemical reduction. In this work, we investigated low&#8208;energy electron attachment to a common RAFT agent (cyanomethyl benzodithioate), and, for comparison, a simple carbonothioylsulfanyl compound (dimethyl trithiocarbonate, DMTTC) in the gas phase by means of mass spectrometry and quantum chemical calculations. We observe for both compounds that specific cleavage of the C&#8208;S bond is induced upon low&#8208;energy electron attachment at electron energies close to zero eV. This applies even in the case of a poor homolytic leaving group (&#8729;CH  3  in DMTTC). All other dissociation reactions found at higher electron energies are much less abundant. The present results show a high control of the chemical reactions induced by electron attachment.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrolactonization Reactions Driven by a Pentafluorobenzoyl Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrolactones constitute a privileged class of natural and synthetic products with a broad range of applications in the fine chemicals and pharmaceutical industry. Despite all the progress made towards their synthesis, notably from  seco  &#8208;acids, a macrolactonization promoter system that is effective, selective, flexible, readily available, and, insofar as possible, compatible with manifold functional groups is still lacking. Herein, we describe a strategy that relies on the formation of a mixed anhydride incorporating a pentafluorophenyl group which, due to its high electronic activation enables a convenient access to macrolactones, macrodiolides and esters with a broad versatility. Kinetic studies and DFT computations were performed to rationalize the reactivity of the pentafluorophenyl group in macrolactonization reactions.</dc:description>

Reversible Li plating/stripping at both high current density of 60&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and areal capacity of 60&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved by designing an ultra&#8208;thin graphene quantum dot overlayer capable of efficient Li&#8208;ion adsorbing at the nanoscale on Li&#8208;metal.







Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;current&#8208;density and high&#8208;area&#8208;capacity operation of Li metal anodes offers promising opportunities for high&#8208;performing next&#8208;generation batteries. However, high&#8208;rate Li deposition suffers from undesired Li&#8208;ion depletion especially at the electrolyte&#8208;anode interface, which compromises achievable capacity and lifetime. Here, electronegative graphene quantum dots are synthesized and assembled into an ultra&#8208;thin overlayer capable of efficient Li&#8208;ion adsorbing at the nanoscale on Li&#8208;metal to fully relieve Li&#8208;ion depletion. The protected Li anode achieves long&#8208;term reversible Li plating/stripping over 1000&#8197;h at both superior current density of 60&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and areal capacity of 60&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Implementation of the protected anode allows for the construction of Li&#8208;air full battery with both enhanced rate capability and cycling performance.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral (dihydro)furo&#8208;fused heterocycles are significant structural motifs in numerous natural products, functional materials and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, developing efficient methods for preparing compounds with these privileged scaffolds is an important endeavor in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we develop an effective, modular method by a dipeptide&#8208;phosphonium salt&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereoselective cascade reaction of readily available linear &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with aromatic alkenes, affording a wide variety of structurally fused heterocyclic molecules in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities. Of note, this method provides a platform for building three types of valuable dihydrofuro&#8208;fused rigid tricyclic architectures that have great synthetic challenges. Moreover, mechanistic investigations revealed that the bifunctional phosphonium salt catalyst controlled the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities of this cascade transformation, particularly proceeding through the initial ketone &#945;&#8208;addition followed by  O  &#8208;participated substitution; and the multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between Br&#248;nsted acid moieties of catalyst and nitro group of aromatic alkene were crucial in asymmetric induction. Given the generality, versatility, and high efficiency of this method, we anticipate that it will have broad synthetic utilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Molecules or Semiconductors in Photocatalysis?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the realm of solids, Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) offer unique possibilities for a rationale&#8208;based engineering of tailored physical properties. These derive from the modular, molecular make&#8208;up of MOFs, which allows for the selection and modification of the organic and inorganic building units that construct them. The adaptable properties make MOFs interesting materials for photocatalysis, an area of increasing significance. But the molecular and porous nature of a MOs leaves the field, in some areas, juxtapositioned between semiconductor physics and homogeneous photocatalysis. While descriptors from both fields are applied in tandem, the gap between theory and experiment has widened in some area&#8217;s, and arguably needs fixing.
Here we review, on the basis of the literature, where MOFs have shown to be similar to conventional semiconductors in photocatalysis, and where they have shown to be more like infinite molecules in solution. We do this from the perspective of band theory, which in the context of photocatalysis, covers both the molecular and nonmolecular principles of relevance.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypsochromic Shift of Multiple&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Induced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence by Oxygen Atom Incorporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiple&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence material that comprised oxygen, nitrogen, and boron atoms (&#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;O&#8208;Me) was synthesized via one&#8208;shot double borylation. An OLED device employing the fabricated &#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;O&#8208;Me exhibits deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum and a high external quantum efficiency with minimum efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Herein, we reported an ultrapure blue multiple&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;O&#8208;Me) with a high photoluminescence quantum yield and a large rate constant for reverse intersystem crossing. Because of restricted &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the HOMO rather than the LUMO induced by oxygen atom incorporation, &#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;O&#8208;Me shows a hypsochromic shift compared to the parent MR&#8208;TADF material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA). An organic light&#8208;emitting diode based on this material exhibits an emission at 465&#8197;nm, with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 23&#8197;nm and Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates of (0.13, 0.10), and a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 29.5&#8201;%. Moreover, &#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;O&#8208;Me facilitates a drastically improved efficiency roll&#8208;off and a device lifetime compared to &#957;&#8208;DABNA, which demonstrates significant potential of the oxygen atom incorporation strategy.

         <dc:description>
Two modular&#8208;agent probes (MAPs) with same agents (small molecule scaffold module for construction and photodynamic reaction, module T for enhancing the internalization by tumor cells and module M for causing mitochondrial dysfunction) but different spatial arrangements are designed. T&#8208;AIE&#8208;M with larger RGD binding angle performed higher specificities, while TM&#8208;AIE characterizing longer &#945;&#8208;helix structure displayed superior toxicity.







Abstract
To overcome a series of challenges in tumor therapy, modular&#8208;agent probes (MAPs) comprised of various functional modules have been proposed. Researchers have tried to optimize the MAPs by exploiting the new modules or increasing the numbers of module, while neglecting the configuration of various modules. Here, we focus on the different spatial arrangements of existing modules. By utilizing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivative with stereochemical structure and dual modifiable end&#8208;group sites as small molecule scaffold, two MAPs with same modular agents (module T for enhancing the internalization of MAPs by tumor cells and module M for causing mitochondrial dysfunction) but different spatial arrangements (on the one side, TM&#8208;AIE, and two sides, T&#8208;AIE&#8208;M, of the molecule scaffold) are designed. T&#8208;AIE&#8208;M with larger RGD binding angle performed higher specificity, while TM&#8208;AIE characterizing longer &#945;&#8208;helix structure displayed superior toxicity.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mediated In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly Promotes In Vivo Bioorthogonal Reaction for Pretargeted Multimodality Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pretargeted multimodality imaging strategy based on combination the enzyme&#8208;mediated fluorogenic reaction and in situ self&#8208;assembly with the IEDDA reaction. A trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) bearing small&#8208;molecule probe is first activated by the target enzyme, leading to in situ self&#8208;assembly and enrichment of the TCOs. This allows subsequent labelling of radioisotope s via the IEDDA reaction, providing NIR FL, MRI and PET signals for in vivo imaging.







Abstract
Pretargeted imaging has emerged as a promising approach to advance nuclear imaging of malignant tumors. Herein, we combine the enzyme&#8208;mediated fluorogenic reaction and in situ self&#8208;assembly with the inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction to develop an activatable pretargeted strategy for multimodality imaging. The trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) bearing small&#8208;molecule probe, P&#8208;FFGd&#8208;TCO, can be activated by alkaline phosphatase and in situ self&#8208;assembles into nanoaggregates (FMNPs&#8208;TCO) retained on the membranes, permitting to (1) amplify near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence (FL) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals, and (2) enrich TCOs to promote IEDDA ligation. The Gallium&#8208;68 (68Ga) labeled tetrazine can readily conjugate the tumor&#8208;retained FMNPs&#8208;TCO to enhance radioactivity uptake in tumors. Strong NIR FL, MRI, and positron emission tomography (PET) signals are concomitantly achieved, allowing for pretargeted multimodality imaging of ALP activity in HeLa tumor&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>Chemical Characterization of a Volatile Dubnium Compound, DbOCl3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dubnium obeys Mendeleev's periodicity. Fifty years after the discovery of this element, its chemical behavior was experimentally revisited. From the gas chromatographic investigation of the volatile oxychloride compound, a trend of decreasing volatility along Group&#8197;5 elements was deduced, in agreement with the expectations by the laws established in the Periodic Table.







Abstract
The formation and the chemical characterization of single atoms of dubnium (Db, element 105), in the form of its volatile oxychloride, was investigated using the on&#8208;line gas phase chromatography technique, in the temperature range 350&#8211;600&#8201;&#176;C. Under the exactly same chemical conditions, comparative studies with the lighter homologues of Group&#8197;5 in the Periodic Table clearly indicate the volatility sequence being NbOCl3 &gt; TaOCl3 &#8805; DbOCl3. From the obtained experimental results, thermochemical data for DbOCl3 were derived. The present study delivers reliable experimental information for theoretical calculations on chemical properties of transactinides.

         <title>A TiSe2&#8208;Graphite Dual Ion Battery: Fast Na&#8208;Ion Insertion and Excellent Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TiSe2&#8208;graphite Na&#8208;DIB with fast kinetics and excellent cycling stability is for the first time proposed by combing a TiSe2 Na&#8208;ion anode with an anion&#8208;storing graphite cathode. Compared with other Na&#8208;DIBs, the TiSe2&#8208;graphite Na&#8208;DIB significantly improves the Na&#8208;ion insertion kinetics with superior cycle stability. The Na&#8208;ion and PF6&#8722; storage mechanism is investigated.







Abstract
The sodium dual ion battery (Na&#8208;DIB) technology is proposed as highly promising alternative over lithium&#8208;ion batteries for the stationary electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of anode materials seriously impedes their practical implementation. Herein, a Na&#8208;DIB based on TiSe2&#8208;graphite is reported.

&lt;p&gt;A TiSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-graphite Na-DIB with fast kinetics and excellent cycling stability is for the first time proposed by combing a TiSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Na-ion anode with an anion-storing graphite cathode. Compared with other Na-DIBs, the TiSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-graphite Na-DIB significantly improves the Na-ion insertion kinetics with superior cycle stability. The Na-ion and PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; storage mechanism is investigated.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sodium dual ion battery (Na-DIB) technology is proposed as highly promising alternative over lithium-ion batteries for the stationary electrochemical energy-storage devices. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of anode materials seriously impedes their practical implementation. Herein, a Na-DIB based on TiSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-graphite is reported. The high diffusion coefficient of Na-ions (3.21&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;11&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;1.20&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;9&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and the very low Na-ion diffusion barrier (0.50&#8197;eV) lead to very fast electrode kinetics, alike in conventional surface capacitive storage systems. In-situ investigations reveal that the fast Na-ion diffusion involves four insertion stage compositions. A prototype cell shows a reversible capacity of 81.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, excellent stability with 83.52&#8201;% capacity retention over 200&#8197;cycles and excellent rate performance, suggesting its potential for next-generation large scale high-performance stationary energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enhanced Band Convergence and Ultra&#8208;Low Thermal Conductivity Lead to High Thermoelectric Performance in SnTe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high thermoelectric performance in SnTe is demonstrated via simultaneous modulation of electronic structure and inhibition of the phonon propagation.







Abstract
SnTe, a structural analogue of champion thermoelectric (TE) material PbTe, has recently attracted wide attention for TE energy conversion. Herein, we demonstrate a co&#8208;doping strategy to improve the TE performance of SnTe via simultaneous modulation of electronic structure and phonon transport. The electrical transport is optimized by 3&#8197;mol&#8201;% Ag doping in self&#8208;compensated SnTe (i.e., Sn1.03Te). Further, Mg doping in SnAg0.03Te resulted in highly converged valence bands, which enhanced the Seebeck coefficient markedly. The energy gap between two uppermost valence bands (&#916;Ev) decreases to 0.10&#8197;eV in Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te compared to 0.35&#8197;eV in pristine SnTe. The optimized p&#8208;type carrier concentration and highly converged valence bands gave a high power factor of ca. 27&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 at 865&#8197;K in Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te. The lattice thermal conductivity of Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te reached to an ultra&#8208;low value of &#8776;0.23&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 865&#8197;K due to the formation of MgTe nanoprecipitates in SnTe matrix. These combined effects resulted in a high TE figure of merit, zT&#8776;1.55 at 865&#8197;K in Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te.

         <title>Loading Linear Arrays of CuII Inside Aromatic Amide Helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Very stable helices of oligoamides uptake CuII ions in their cavity through deprotonation with minimal alteration of their shape, unlike most metallo&#8208;organic structures which generally differ from their organic precursors. The outcome is the formation of intramolecular linear arrays of up to 16 CuII centers, forming a molecular mimic of a metal wire completely surrounded by an organic sheath.







Abstract
The very stable helices of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarboxylic acid oligoamides are shown to uptake CuII ions in their cavity through deprotonation of their amide functions with minimal alteration of their shape, unlike most metallo&#8208;organic structures which generally differ from their organic precursors. The outcome is the formation of intramolecular linear arrays of a defined number of CuII centers (up to sixteen in this study) at a 3&#8197;&#197; distance, forming a molecular mimic of a metal wire completely surrounded by an organic sheath. The helices pack in the solid state so that the arrays of CuII extend intermolecularly. Conductive&#8208;AFM and cyclic voltammetry suggest that electrons are transported throughout the metal&#8208;loaded helices in contrast with hole transport observed for analogous foldamers devoid of metal ions.

         <title>Liposomes with Water as a pH&#8208;Responsive Functionality for Targeting of Acidic Tumor and Infection Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new lipid, DCPA, was prepared, possessing a hydrophilic, pyridine betaine group that can be hydrogen&#8208;bonded with water yielding DCPA&#8208;H2O. Self&#8208;assembled DCPA&#8208;H2O liposomes become rapidly protonated at relatively high pH (&lt;7.0) due to the high HOMO binding energy of DCPA&#8208;H2O. As a result, DCPA&#8208;H2O liposomes target faster to solid tumors and infectious biofilms than natural DPPC or cationic DCPM liposomes.







Abstract
A lipid named DCPA was synthesized under microwave&#8208;assisted heating. DCPA possesses a pyridine betaine, hydrophilic group that can be complexed with water through hydrogen bonding (DCPA&#8208;H2O). DCPA&#8208;H2O liposomes became protonated relatively fast already at pH&lt;6.8, due to the high HOMO binding energy of DCPA&#8208;H2O. In murine models, DCPA&#8208;H2O liposomes had longer blood circulation times than natural DPPC or cationic DCPM liposomes, while after tail&#8208;vein injection DCPA&#8208;H2O liposomes targeted faster to solid tumors and intra&#8208;abdominal infectious biofilms. Therapeutic efficacy in a murine, infected wound&#8208;healing model of tail&#8208;vein injected ciprofloxacin&#8208;loaded DCPA&#8208;H2O liposomes exceeded the ones of clinically applied ciprofloxacin as well as of ciprofloxacin&#8208;loaded DPPC or DCPM liposomes.

         <title>Branched Aggregates with Tunable Morphology via Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Azobenzene&#8208;Derived Molecular Double Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diverse branched supermicelles can be prepared by particle&#8211;particle connection of primary tapered worm&#8208;like aggregates from azobenzene&#8208;containing Janus molecular double brushes (MDBs), which further enables biomimetic morphology evolution from Antedon&#8208; to starfish&#8208;shaped architectures upon UV irradiation.







Abstract
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly is one of the most effective approaches to fabricate nature&#8208;inspired materials with subtle nanostructures. We report a distinct hierarchical self&#8208;assembly process of molecular double brushes (MDBs) with each graft site carrying a poly(azobenzene&#8208;acrylate) (PAzo) chain and a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) chain. Asymmetric tapered worm (ATW) nanostructures with chain&#8208;end reactivity assembling from the azobenzene&#8208;derived MDBs serve as primary subunits to prepare branched supermicelles by increasing water content (Cw) in THF/water. Various natural Antedon&#8208;shaped multiarm worm&#8208;like aggregates (MWAs) can be created via the particle&#8211;particle connection of ATWs. Intriguingly, the azobenzene moieties undergo trans&#8211;cis isomerization upon UV irradiation and further promote a morphology evolution of MWAs. Multiscale supermicelles comprised of starfish shapes with differing central body and arm morphologies (e.g., compare to the biological specimens Luidia ciliaris and Crossaster papposus) were prepared by manipulating irradiation time.

         <title>A Cationic Micelle as In Vivo Catalyst for Tumor&#8208;Localized Cleavage Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic micelles accelerate desilylation&#8208;induced cleavage chemistry over 1400&#8208;fold under physiological conditions. This micelle&#8208;catalyzed desilylation strategy unveils the potential that micelles may act beyond carriers but as in vivo catalysts for local perturbing or activation.







Abstract
The emerging strategies of accelerating the cleavage reaction in tumors through locally enriching the reactants is promising. Yet, the applications are limited due to the lack of the tumor&#8208;selectivity for most of the reactants. Here we explored an alternative approach to leverage the rate constant by locally inducing an in vivo catalyst. We found that the desilylation&#8208;induced cleavage chemistry could be catalyzed in vivo by cationic micelles, and accelerated over 1400&#8208;fold under physiological condition. This micelle&#8208;catalyzed controlled release platform is demonstrated by the release of a 6&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;benzothiazole derivative (HQB) in two cancer cell lines and a NIR dye in mouse tumor xenografts. Through intravenous injection of a pH&#8208;sensitive polymer micelles, we successfully applied this strategy to a prodrug activation of hydroxyl camptothecin (OH&#8208;CPT) in tumors. Its &#8220;decaging&#8221; efficiency is 42&#8208;fold to that without cationic micelles&#8208;mediated catalysis. This micelle&#8208;catalyzed desilylation strategy unveils the potential that micelle may act beyond a carrier but a catalyst for local perturbing or activation.

         <title>Plasma Tuning Local Environment of Hexagonal Boron Nitride for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hexagonal boron nitride (  h  &#8208;BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides. However, high crystallinity of commercial  h  &#8208;BN and elusive cognition of active sites hindered the enhancement of utilization efficiency. Herein, four kinds of plasmas (N  2  , O  2  , H  2  , Ar) were accordingly employed to regulate the local chemical environment of  h  &#8208;BN. N  2  &#8208;treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520 &#176;C. Spectroscopy demonstrated that &#8220;three&#8208;boron center&#8221; N&#8208;defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane. While the sintering effect of the &#8220;BO  x  &#8221; species in O  2  &#8208;treated BN, led to the suppressed catalytic performance (12.4% conversion at 520 &#176;C).</dc:description>

         <title>A Top&#8208;Down Strategy to Realize Surface Reconstruction of Small&#8208;Sized Platinum&#8208;Based Nanoparticles for Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A top&#8208;down thermal annealing strategy has been proposed for the precise surface reconstruction of Pt&#8208;based nanoparticles. The reconstructed nanoparticles display excellent stability at high temperature, yet serve as highly active and selective catalysts for the hydrogenations of phenylacetylene and 4&#8208;nitrostyrene.







Abstract
Over the past decades, despite the substantial efforts that have been devoted to the modifications of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) to tailor their selectivities for hydrogenation reactions, there are still a lack of facile strategies for precisely regulation of the surface properties of NPs, especially for those with small sizes. In this work, we propose a top&#8208;down thermal annealing strategy for tuning the surface properties of Pt&#8208;based NPs (&#8776;4&#8197;nm) without the occurrence of aggregation. Compared to conventional bottom&#8208;up methods, the present top&#8208;down strategy can precisely regulate the surface compositions of Pt&#8208;Cd NPs and other ternary Pt&#8208;Cd&#8208;M NPs (M=Fe, Ni, Co, Mn, and Sn). The optimized Pt&#8208;Cd NPs exhibit excellent selectivity toward phenylacetylene and 4&#8208;nitrostyrene hydrogenations with a styrene selectivity and 4&#8208;aminophenyl styrene selectivity of 95.2&#8201;% and 94.5&#8201;%, respectively. This work provides a general strategy for the surface reconstructions of Pt&#8208;based NPs, and promotes fundamental research on catalyst design for heterogeneous catalysis.

Imaging mass spectrometry is used to investigate the effects of modafinil on the alteration of lipid composition on fly brain. Modafinil induces a decrease in PC and SM contents and increases the levels of PEs and PIs. The lipid changes caused by modafinil are similar to the effects of methylphenidate, which also improves cognition.







Abstract
Modafinil, a widely used psychoactive drug, has been shown to exert a positive impact on cognition and is used to treat sleep disorders and hyperactivity. Using time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometric imaging, we studied the changes of brain lipids of Drosophila melanogaster induced by modafinil to gain insight into the functional mechanism of modafinil in the brain. We found that upon modafinil treatment, the abundance of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin species in the central brain of Drosophila is significantly decreased, whereas the levels of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol in the brains show significant enhancement compared to the control flies. The alteration of brain lipids caused by modafinil is consistent with previous studies about cognition&#8208;related drugs and offers a plausible mechanism regarding the action of modafinil in the brain as well as a potential target for the treatment of certain disorders.

         <title>A General Approach to Convert Hemicyanine Dyes into Highly Optimized Photoacoustic Scaffolds for Analyte Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed PA&#8208;HD, a new sulfur&#8208;substituted dye platform exhibiting enhanced properties for photoacoustic probe development. To demonstrate generalizability, we employed PA&#8208;HD to access probes for beta&#8208;galactosidase and nitroreductase activities, as well as H2O2. Each probe was tested in live cells and in vivo. For instance, the H2O2 probe was employed to visualize oxidative stress in an Alzheimer's disease model.







Abstract
Most photoacoustic (PA) imaging agents are based on the repurposing of existing fluorescent dye platforms that exhibit non&#8208;optimal properties for PA applications. Herein, we introduce PA&#8208;HD, a new dye scaffold optimized for PA probe development that features a 4.8&#8208;fold increase in sensitivity and a red&#8208;shift of the &#955;abs from 690&#8197;nm to 745&#8197;nm to enable ratiometric imaging. Computational modeling was used to elucidate the origin of these enhanced properties. To demonstrate the generalizability of our remodeling efforts, we developed three probes for &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;Gal), nitroreductase activity (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;NTR), and H2O2 (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;H2O2). We generated two cancer models to evaluate PA&#8208;HD&#8208;Gal and PA&#8208;HD&#8208;NTR. We employed a murine model of Alzheimer's disease to test PA&#8208;HD&#8208;H2O2. There, we observed a PA signal increase at 735&#8197;nm of 1.79&#177;0.20&#8208;fold relative to background, indicating the presence of oxidative stress. These results were confirmed via ratiometric calibration, which was not possible using the parent HD platform.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF, a unique cubic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) comprising hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) supertetrahedral units and FeIII ions arranged in a diamond topology is reported. Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF is a highly crystalline, porous and deep black material featuring high electrical conductivity.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a unique cubic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF, comprising hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) supertetrahedral units and FeIII ions, arranged in a diamond topology. The MOF is synthesized under solvothermal conditions, yielding a highly crystalline, deep black powder, with crystallites of 300&#8211;500&#8197;nm size and tetrahedral morphology. Nitrogen sorption analysis indicates a highly porous material with a surface area exceeding 1400&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF shows broadband absorption from 475 up to 1900&#8197;nm with excellent absorption capability of 98.5&#8201;% of the incoming light over the visible spectral region. Electrical conductivity measurements of pressed pellets reveal a high intrinsic electrical conductivity of up to 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Quantum mechanical calculations predict Fe&#8208;HHTP&#8208;MOF to be an efficient electron conductor, exhibiting continuous charge&#8208;carrier pathways throughout the structure.

         <title>Helical Microporous Nanorods Assembled by Polyoxometalate Clusters for the Photocatalytic Oxidation of Toluene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical microporous nanorods (HMNRs) assembled by polyoxometalate (POM) clusters were synthesized by a hydrothermal method, in an attempt to combine the superior photocatalytic performance of POMs and the unique structure of microporous materials without loading POMs onto other microporous materials. The HMNRs exhibit an outstanding performance in photocatalytic toluene oxidation.







Abstract
Microporous materials are extensively used in catalysis due to their unique pore structures. Among them, microporous materials loaded with polyoxometalates (POMs) exhibit considerable potential for catalysis thanks to the combination of the outstanding redox&#8208;catalytic properties of POMs and the characteristics of microporous materials. Based on this, we developed a facile hydrothermal method to synthesize helical microporous nanorods (HMNRs) using POM clusters as building blocks, combining the properties of both POMs and microporous materials while circumventing the complicated loading process. The HMNRs show an enhanced photocatalytic performance for toluene oxidation. Comparatively high activity, superior selectivity towards benzaldehyde, and prominent cycling stability were achieved, manifesting a promising prospect for a future application in photocatalysis.

         <title>Unveiling Five Naked Structures of Tartaric Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformational landscape of the chiral and astrochemical tartaric acid molecule has been revealed for the first time using a combination of laser ablation and rotational spectroscopy techniques. Five different structures have been characterized, being ruled by different hydrogen bonding patterns. Also, this data enables the first attempt to detect this molecule in the interstellar medium.







Abstract
The unbiased, naked structures of tartaric acid, one of the most important organic compounds existing in nature and a candidate to be present in the interstellar medium, has been revealed in this work for the first time. Solid samples of its naturally occurring (R,R) enantiomer have been vaporized by laser ablation, expanded in a supersonic jet, and characterized by Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. In the isolation conditions of the jet, we have discovered up to five different structures stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond networks dominated by O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O=C and O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O motifs extended along the entire molecule. These five forms, two with an extended (trans) disposition of the carbon chain and three with a bent (gauche) disposition, can serve as a basis to represent the shape of tartaric acid. This work also reports the first set of spectroscopy data that can be used to detect tartaric acid in the interstellar medium.

         <title>Electrodeposition of Zinc onto Au(111) and Au(100) from the Ionic Liquid [MPPip][TFSI]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The improvement of rechargeable zinc/air batteries was a hot topic in recent years. Predominantly, the influence of water and of additives on the structure of the Zn deposit and the possible dendrite formation were studied. However, the effect of the surface structure of the underlying substrate was not focused on in detail, yet. In this contribution we show the differences in electrochemical deposition of Zn onto Au(111) and Au(100) from the ionic liquid N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. The fundamental processes were initially characterized via cyclic voltammetry and in situ scanning tunnelling microscopy. Bulk deposits were then examined using Auger electron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Clearly different structures of Zn deposits are observed during the initial stages of electrocrystallisation on both electrodes, which reveals the strong influence of the crystallographic orientation on the metal deposition of zinc on gold.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The improvement of rechargeable zinc/air batteries was a hot topic in recent years. Predominantly, the influence of water and of additives on the structure of the Zn deposit and the possible dendrite formation were studied. However, the effect of the surface structure of the underlying substrate was not focused on in detail, yet. In this contribution we show the differences in electrochemical deposition of Zn onto Au(111) and Au(100) from the ionic liquid N-methyl-N-propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. The fundamental processes were initially characterized via cyclic voltammetry and in situ scanning tunnelling microscopy. Bulk deposits were then examined using Auger electron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Clearly different structures of Zn deposits are observed during the initial stages of electrocrystallisation on both electrodes, which reveals the strong influence of the crystallographic orientation on the metal deposition of zinc on gold.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unravelling the Hydration Barrier of Lignin Oleate Nanoparticles for Acid&#8208; and Base&#8208;Catalyzed Functionalization in Dispersion State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) are promising renewable nanomaterials with applications ranging from biomedicine to water purification. However, instability of LNPs under acidic and basic conditions severely limits their functionalization for improved performance. Here, we show that controlling the degree of esterification can significantly improve the stability of lignin oleate nanoparticles (OLNPs) in acidic and basic aqueous dispersions. The high stability of OLNPs is attributed to the alkyl chains accumulated in the shell of the particle, which delays protonation/deprotonation of carboxylic acid and phenolic hydroxyl groups. Owing to the enhanced stability, acid&#8208; and base&#8208;catalyzed functionalization of OLNPs at pH 2.0 and pH 12.0 via oxirane ring&#8208;opening reactions were successfully performed. We also demonstrate these new functionalized particles as efficient pH&#8208;switchable dye adsorbents and anticorrosive particulate coatings.</dc:description>

         <title>Red Light&#8208;Mediated Photoredox Catalysis Enables Self&#8208;Reporting Nitric Oxide Release for Efficient Antibacterial Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitric oxide (NO) serves as not only a key regulator of many physiological processes but also a potent therapeutic agent. The local delivery of NO is important to achieve target therapeutic outcomes due to the toxicity of NO at high concentrations. Although light stimulus represents a non&#8208;invasive tool with spatiotemporal precision to mediate NO release, many photoresponsive NO&#8208;releasing molecules can only respond to ultraviolet (UV) or near&#8208;UV visible light with low penetration and high phototoxicity. Here, we report that coumarin&#8208;based NO donors with maximal absorbances at 328 nm can be activated under (deep) red light (630 or 700 nm) irradiation in the presence of palladium(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin, enabling stoichiometric and self&#8208;reporting NO release with a photolysis quantum yield of 8% via photoredox catalysis. This NO&#8208;releasing platform with ciprofloxacin loading can eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm in vitro and treat cutaneous abscesses in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Creation of High&#8208;Performance Heterogeneous Photocatalysts by Controlling Ligand Desorption and Particle Size of Gold Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand&#8208;desorption process during calcination was elucidated for metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported thiolate&#8208;protected gold (Au) 25&#8208;atom metal nanoculusters (NCs) using five experimental techniques. Furthermore, based on obtained knowledge, a method was established to form a metal&#8208;oxide layer on the surface of Au NCs while preventing their aggregation, thereby succeeding in creating a water&#8208;splitting photocatalyst with high activity and stability.







Abstract
Recently, the creation of new heterogeneous catalysts using the unique electronic/geometric structures of small metal nanoclusters (NCs) has received considerable attention. However, to achieve this, it is extremely important to establish methods to remove the ligands from ligand&#8208;protected metal NCs while preventing the aggregation of metal NCs. In this study, the ligand&#8208;desorption process during calcination was followed for metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported 2&#8208;phenylethanethiolate&#8208;protected gold (Au) 25&#8208;atom metal NCs using five experimental techniques. The results clearly demonstrate that the ligand&#8208;desorption process consists of ligand dissociation on the surface of the metal NCs, adsorption of the generated compounds on the support and desorption of the compounds from the support, and the temperatures at which these processes occurred were elucidated. Based on the obtained knowledge, we established a method to form a metal&#8208;oxide layer on the surface of Au NCs while preventing their aggregation, thereby succeeding in creating a water&#8208;splitting photocatalyst with high activity and stability.

However, to achieve this, it is extremely important to establish methods to remove the ligands from ligand-protected metal NCs while preventing the aggregation of metal NCs. In this study, the ligand-desorption process during calcination was followed for metal-oxide-supported 2-phenylethanethiolate-protected gold (Au) 25-atom metal NCs using five experimental techniques. The results clearly demonstrate that the ligand-desorption process consists of ligand dissociation on the surface of the metal NCs, adsorption of the generated compounds on the support and desorption of the compounds from the support, and the temperatures at which these processes occurred were elucidated.

         <title>Structural Changes during the Growth of Atomically Precise Metal Oxido Nanoclusters from Combined Pair Distribution Function and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of tools for combined, automated analysis of pair distribution function (PDF) and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) data enabled the identification of intermediate species in the formation of atomically precise [Bi38O45] nanoclusters (see picture). By studying cluster&#8211;solvent interactions it was also found that the solvent can affect the metal oxido structure.







Abstract
The combination of in situ pair distribution function (PDF) analysis and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) enables analysis of the formation mechanism of metal oxido nanoclusters and cluster&#8211;solvent interactions as they take place. Herein, we demonstrate the method for the formation of clusters with a [Bi38O45] core. Upon dissolution of crystalline [Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]&#8901;3&#8201;H2O in DMSO, an intermediate rapidly forms, which slowly grows to stable [Bi38O45] clusters. To identify the intermediate, we developed an automated modeling method, where smaller [BixOy] structures based on the [Bi38O45] framework are tested against the data. [Bi22O26] was identified as the main intermediate species, illustrating how combined PDF and SAXS analysis is a powerful tool to gain insight into nucleation on an atomic scale. PDF also provides information on the interaction between nanoclusters and solvent, which is shown to depend on the nature of the ligands on the cluster surface.

         <title>Designing Cation&#8211;Solvent Fully Coordinated Electrolyte for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Full Cell Based On Solid&#8211;Solid Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cation&#8211;solvent fully coordinated ether electrolyte simultaneously resolves the problems at both the Li anode and S@pPAN cathode. Benefitting from the electrolyte solvation structure, a long&#8208;life and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;sulfur pouch cell was prepared. (solvent separated ion pair (SSIP), contact ion pair (CIP), aggregate (AGG).)







Abstract
Sulfur chemistry based on solid&#8211;liquid dissolution&#8208;deposition route inevitably encounters shuttle of lithium polysulfides, its parasitic interaction with lithium (Li) anode and flood electrolyte environment. The sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) cathode favors solid&#8208;solid conversion mechanism in carbonate ester electrolytes but fails to pair high&#8208;capacity Li anode. Herein, we rationally design a cation&#8208;solvent fully coordinated ether electrolyte to simultaneously resolve the problems of both Li anode and S@pPAN cathode. Raman spectroscopy reveals a highly suppressed solvent activity and a cation&#8208;solvent fully coordinated structure (molar ratio 1:1). Consequently, Li electrodeposit evolves into round&#8208;edged morphology, LiF&#8208;rich interphase, and high reversibility. Moreover, S@pPAN cathode inherits a neat solid&#8208;phase redox reaction and fully eliminated the dissolution of lithium polysulfides. Finally, we harvest a long&#8208;life Li&#8208;S@pPAN pouch cell with slight Li metal excessive (0.4 time) and ultra&#8208;lean electrolyte design (1&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mgS&#8722;1), delivering 394&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 energy density based on electrodes and electrolyte mass.

         <title>Inorganic Synthesis Based on Reactions of Ionic Liquids and Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical reactivity of ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents can intentionally be exploited as a synthetic tool to prepare inorganic materials that are difficult or even impossible to obtain by traditional synthetic routes. This Review summarizes recent developments in inorganic syntheses that take advantage of reactions with ionic liquids or deep eutectic solvents.







Abstract
Ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents are of growing interest as solvents for the resource&#8208;efficient synthesis of inorganic materials. This Review covers chemical reactions of various deep eutectic solvents and types of ionic liquids, including metal&#8208;containing ionic liquids, [BF4]&#8722;&#8208; or [PF6]&#8722;&#8208;based ionic liquids, basic ionic liquids, and chalcogen&#8208;containing ionic liquids. Cases in which cations, anions, or both are incorporated into the final products are also included. The purpose of this Review is to raise caution about the chemical reactivity of ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents and to establish a guide for their proper use.

         <title>Mechanosynthesis of Higher&#8208;Order Cocrystals: Tuning Order, Functionality and Size in Cocrystal Design**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanosynthesis gives ternary and quaternary hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic cocrystals held together via synergistic intermolecular interactions. Notably, higher&#8208;order ternary and quaternary cocrystals can be readily obtained either via serial synthetic routes from the individual components or via one&#8208;pot approaches.







Abstract
The ability to rationally design and predictably construct crystalline solids has been the hallmark of crystal engineering research. To date, numerous examples of multicomponent crystals comprising organic molecules have been reported. However, the crystal engineering of cocrystals comprising both organic and inorganic chemical units is still poorly understood and mostly unexplored. Here, we report a new diverse set of higher&#8208;order cocrystals (HOCs) based on the structurally versatile&#8212;yet largely unexplored&#8212;phosph(V/V)azane heterosynthon building block. The novel ternary and quaternary cocrystals reported are held together by synergistic and orthogonal intermolecular interactions. Notably, the HOCs can be readily obtained either via sequential or one&#8208;pot mechanochemical methods. Computational modelling methods reveal that the HOCs are thermodynamically driven to form and that their mechanical properties strongly depend on the composition and intermolecular forces in the crystal, offering untapped potential for optimizing material properties.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Branched Aromatic &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids by Biocatalytic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transaminase&#8208;based dynamic kinetic resolution was developed for the preparation of &#946;&#8208;branched aromatic &#945;&#8208;amino acids with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. The reaction was facilitated by the use of a thermophilic enzyme that tolerates elevated temperatures and pH values and exhibits broad substrate promiscuity. The utility of the process was demonstrated in the total synthesis of jomthonic acid&#8197;A (see scheme).







Abstract

     alt="Stereoselective Synthesis of &#946;-Branched Aromatic &#945;-Amino Acids by Biocatalytic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A transaminase-based dynamic kinetic resolution was developed for the preparation of &#946;-branched aromatic &#945;-amino acids with high diastereo- and enantioselectivity. The reaction was facilitated by the use of a thermophilic enzyme that tolerates elevated temperatures and pH values and exhibits broad substrate promiscuity. The utility of the process was demonstrated in the total synthesis of jomthonic acid&#8197;A (see scheme).

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Constructing an Acidic Microenvironment by MoS2 in Heterogeneous Fenton Reaction for Pollutant Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have successfully constructed an acidic microenvironment on the surface of CoFe2O4 by chemical bonding MoS2, which ensures the stable circulation of iron ions in the slipping plane and truly overcomes the limitation of pH in pollutant control, thereby expanding the applicability of Fenton technology.







Abstract
Although Fenton or Fenton&#8208;like reactions have been widely used in the environment, biology, life science, and other fields, the sharp decrease in their activity under macroneutral conditions is still a large problem. This study reports a MoS2 cocatalytic heterogeneous Fenton (CoFe2O4/MoS2) system capable of sustainably degrading organic pollutants, such as phenol, in a macroneutral buffer solution. An acidic microenvironment in the slipping plane of CoFe2O4 is successfully constructed by chemically bonding with MoS2. This microenvironment is not affected by the surrounding pH, which ensures the stable circulation of Fe3+/Fe2+ on the surface of CoFe2O4/MoS2 under neutral or even alkaline conditions. Additionally, CoFe2O4/MoS2 always exposes &#8220;fresh&#8221; active sites for the decomposition of H2O2 and the generation of 1O2, effectively inhibiting the production of iron sludge and enhancing the remediation of organic pollutants, even in actual wastewater. This work not only experimentally verifies the existence of an acidic microenvironment on the surface of heterogeneous catalysts for the first time, but also eliminates the pH limitation of the Fenton reaction for pollutant remediation, thereby expanding the applicability of Fenton technology.

         <title>Synthesis of Azaylide&#8208;Based Amphiphiles by the Staudinger Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of new amphiphiles through the Staudinger reaction is reported. These azaylide&#8208;based amphiphiles are stable against hydrolysis even in water and form ca. 2&#8197;nm spherical aggregates through self&#8208;assembly. Furthermore, the obtained amphiphiles are capable of encapsulation of hydrophobic organic dyes in water.







Abstract
Catalyst&#8208; and reagent&#8208;free reactions are powerful tools creating various functional molecules and materials. However, such chemical bonds are usually hydrolysable or require specific functional groups, which limits their use in aqueous media. Herein, we report the development of new amphiphiles through the Staudinger reaction. Simple mixing of chlorinated aryl azide with a hydrophilic moiety and various triarylphosphines (PAr3) gave rise to azaylide&#8208;based amphiphiles NPAr3, rapidly and quantitatively. The obtained NPAr3 formed ca. 2&#8197;nm&#8208;sized spherical aggregates (NPAr3)n in water. The hydrolysis of NPAr3 was significantly suppressed as compared with those of non&#8208;chlorinated amphiphiles nNPAr3. Computational studies revealed that the stability is mainly governed by the decrease in LUMO around the phosphorus atom owing to the o&#8208;substituted halogen groups. Furthermore, hydrophobic dyes such as Nile red and BODIPY were encapsulated by the spherical aggregates (NPAr3)n in water.

         <title>CaMn3IVO4 Cubane Models of the Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Complex: Spin Ground States S&lt;9/2 and the Effect of Oxo Protonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To better describe the Sn&#8208;state intermediates of Photosystem&#8197;II, a ferromagnetically coupled CaMn3IVO4 subunit with an S=9/2 ground state has been proposed. This assignment has played a key role in the mechanism of water oxidation, but electronic&#8208;structure studies of CaMn3IVO4 complexes remain rare. Through cluster desymmetrization or oxo protonation, lower spin ground states are found to be accessible, challenging prior models.







Abstract
We report the single crystal XRD and MicroED structure, magnetic susceptibility, and EPR data of a series of CaMn3IVO4 and YMn3IVO4 complexes as structural and spectroscopic models of the cuboidal subunit of the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex (OEC). The effect of changes in heterometal identity, cluster geometry, and bridging oxo protonation on the spin&#8208;state structure was investigated. In contrast to previous computational models, we show that the spin ground state of CaMn3IVO4 complexes and variants with protonated oxo moieties need not be S=9/2. Desymmetrization of the pseudo&#8208;C3&#8208;symmetric Ca(Y)Mn3IVO4 core leads to a lower S=5/2 spin ground state. The magnitude of the magnetic exchange coupling is attenuated upon oxo protonation, and an S=3/2 spin ground state is observed in CaMn3IVO3(OH). Our studies complement the observation that the interconversion between the low&#8208;spin and high&#8208;spin forms of the S2 state is pH&#8208;dependent, suggesting that the (de)protonation of bridging or terminal oxygen atoms in the OEC may be connected to spin&#8208;state changes.

&lt;/sub&gt;-state intermediates of Photosystem&#8197;II, a ferromagnetically coupled CaMn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; subunit with an &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=9/2 ground state has been proposed. This assignment has played a key role in the mechanism of water oxidation, but electronic-structure studies of CaMn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; complexes remain rare. Through cluster desymmetrization or oxo protonation, lower spin ground states are found to be accessible, challenging prior models.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the single crystal XRD and MicroED structure, magnetic susceptibility, and EPR data of a series of CaMn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and YMn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; complexes as structural and spectroscopic models of the cuboidal subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). The effect of changes in heterometal identity, cluster geometry, and bridging oxo protonation on the spin-state structure was investigated. In contrast to previous computational models, we show that the spin ground state of CaMn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; complexes and variants with protonated oxo moieties need not be &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=9/2. Desymmetrization of the &lt;i&gt;pseudo&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric Ca(Y)Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; core leads to a lower &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=5/2 spin ground state. The magnitude of the magnetic exchange coupling is attenuated upon oxo protonation, and an &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=3/2 spin ground state is observed in CaMn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH). Our studies complement the observation that the interconversion between the low-spin and high-spin forms of the S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; state is pH-dependent, suggesting that the (de)protonation of bridging or terminal oxygen atoms in the OEC may be connected to spin-state changes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>Metal complexes can be considered a &#8216;paradigm of promiscuity&#8217; when it comes to their reactions with proteins. They often form adducts with a variety of donor atoms in an unselective manner. We have characterized the adducts formed between a series of isostructural  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes with Ru, Os, Rh, and Ir centers and the model protein hen egg white lysozyme by X&#8208;ray crystallography and mass spectrometry. Distinctive behavior for the metal compounds was observed with the more labile Ru and Rh complexes targeting a surface l&#8208;histidine moiety through cleavage of  p&#8208;  cymene or NHC co&#8208;ligands, respectively. In contrast, the more inert Os and Ir derivatives were detected in an electronegative binding pocket after undergoing ligand exchange of a chlorido ligand for an amino acid side chain. Computational studies supported the binding profiles and hinted at the role of the protein microenvironment for metal complexes eliciting selectivity for specific binding sites on the protein.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn batteries promise high energy density but suffer from Zn dendritic growth and poor low&#8208;temperature performance. Here, we overcome both challenges by using an eutectic 7.6 m ZnCl2 aqueous electrolyte with 0.05 m SnCl2 additive, which in&#8208;situ forms a zincophilic/zincophobic Sn/Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#8226;H2O bilayer interphase and enables low temperature operation. Zincophilic Sn decreases Zn plating/stripping overpotential and promotes uniform Zn plating, while zincophobic Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#8226;H2O top&#8208;layer suppresses Zn dendrite growth. The eutectic electrolyte has a high ionic conductivity of ~0.8 mS cm&#8208;1 even at &#8208;70 &#176;C due to the distortion of hydrogen bond network by solvated Zn2+ and Cl&#8208;. The eutectic electrolyte enables Zn||Ti half&#8208;cell a high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of &gt;99.7% for 200 cycles and Zn||Zn cell steady charge/discharge for 500 h with a low overpotential of 8 mV at 3 mA cm&#8208;2. Practically, Zn||VOPO4 batteries maintain &gt;95% capacity with a CE of &gt;99.9% for 200 cycles at &#8208;50 &#176;C, and retain ~30% capacity at &#8208;70 &#176;C of that at 20 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Void Space versus Surface Functionalization for Proton Conduction in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Void space and pore surface functionalization are important structural factors for the design of proton&#8208;conductive MOFs. The priority of these factors was studied systematically, and a MOF with lower porosity and high pore surface functionalization was found to have remarkably high proton conductivity. On the other hand, high porosity proved inefficient in inducing high proton conductivity (see picture).







Abstract
Void space and functionality of the pore surface are important structural factors for proton&#8208;conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) impregnated with conducting media. However, no clear study has compared their priority factors, which need to be considered when designing proton&#8208;conductive MOFs. Herein, we demonstrate the effects of void space and pore&#8208;surface modification on proton conduction in MOFs through the surface&#8208;modified isoreticular MOF&#8208;74(Ni) series [Ni2(dobdc or dobpdc), dobdc=2,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate and dobpdc=4,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;(1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl)&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate]. The MOF with lower porosity with the same surface functionality showed higher proton conductivity than that with higher porosity despite including a smaller amount of conducting medium. Density functional theory calculations suggest that strong hydrogen bonding between molecules of the conducting medium at high porosity is inefficient in inducing high proton conductivity.

         <dc:description>A combined strategy of building blocks recognition and molecular network construction, termed the building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN), was first presented to facilitate the&#160;efficient discovery of novel natural products. By mapping the BBMN of the total alkaloid fraction of  Flueggea suffruticosa  , three  Securinega  alkaloids (SEAs) with unusual chemical architectures, suffranidines A&#8211;C (  1  &#8211;  3  ), were discovered and isolated. Compound  1  characterizes an unprecedented 8/5/6/5/6/6/6/6&#8208;fused octacyclic scaffold with a unique cage&#8208;shaped 3&#8208;azatricyclo[6.4.0.0  3,11  ]dodecane core. Compounds  2  and  3  are highly modified SEA dimers that incorporate additional C6 motifs. A hypothetical biosynthetic pathway for  1  &#8211;  3  was proposed. In addition,  1  significantly induced neuronal differentiation and neurite extension by upregulating eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2)&#8208;mediated protein synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral V&#8208;shaped Pyrenes: Hexagonal Packing, Superhelix and Amplified Chiroptical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we designed symmetric and asymmetric chiral V&#8208;shaped pyrenes by linking achiral pyrenes to  trans  &#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexane diamine scaffolds with varied spacers to investigate their circular dichroism ( CD) and circularly polarized excimer emission (CPEE). In molecular solution, the symmetric V&#8208;shaped molecules (  P1  ,  P2  ,  P3  ) displayed spacer &#8208;dependent CD and CPEE originated from the intramolecular excimers while the asymmetric V&#8208;shaped  B  was silent in CD and CPEE. Upon self&#8208;assembly, the chiral V&#8208;shaped conf ormation facilitated a helical hexagonal packing. Notably,  P1  self&#8208;assembled into delicate superhelices with optimum chiroptical activities and the largest  g  abs  for pyrene derivatives to date . T he asymmetric  B  formed two distinct hexagonal aggregates as twists and rectangular nanotubes with greatly amplified CPEE . T his work demonstrates unprecedented hexagonal superhelices from chiral V&#8208;shaped scaffolds and provides a deep insight into the relationship among the molecular conformation , supramolecular architectures and their chiroptical performance.</dc:description>

Deprotonation of a boron&#8208;bound exocyclic methyl group in a B&#8208;methyl borole yields the first 5&#8208;boratafulvene anion &#8211; an isomer to boratabenzene. Boratafulvene was structurally characterised and its electronic structure probed by DFT calculations.

The non&#8208;aromatic boratafulvene reacts as a C&#8208;centered nucleophile with mild electrophile Me  3  SnCl to give a stannylmethyl borole, regenerating the anti&#8208;aromaticity. As nucleophilic synthons for boroles, boratafulvenes thus open an entirely new avenue for synthetic strategies toward this highly reactive class of heterocycles.

         <title>A Highly Strained All&#8208;Phenylene Conjoined Bismacrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the precise synthesis of a 3D highly strained all&#8208;phenylene conjoined bismacrocycle (SCPP[10]). Theoretical calculations indicate that this bismacrocycle has a very high strain energy of 110.59&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and the largest interphenylene torsion angle of 46.07&#176;. A 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex of SCPP[10] and PCBM was formed and investigated.







Abstract
Herein, we report the precise synthesis of a 3D highly strained all&#8208;phenylene bismacrocycle, termed conjoined (1,4)[10]cycloparaphenylenophane (SCPP[10]). This structure consists of a twisted benzene ring which is bridged twice by phenylene units anchored in two para&#8208;positions. The conjoined structure of SCPP[10] was confirmed in real space at the atomic scale by scanning tunneling microscopy. Theoretical calculations indicate that this bismacrocycle has a very high strain energy of 110.59&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and the largest interphenylene torsion angle of 46.07&#176; caused by multiple repulsive interactions. Furthermore, a 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex of SCPP[10] and [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester was investigated, which represents the first peanut&#8208;shaped 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex based on bismacrocycles.

[o&#8208;C5H4NHOH]2[I7O18(OH)]&#8901;3&#8201;H2O exhibits the first example of [I7O18(OH)]
 branched polyiodate chains and high SHG effect. The asymmetric (o&#8208;C5H4NHOH)+ is in favor of polymerization and inducing the formation of the NCS structure.







Abstract
An organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid polyiodate, namely, [o&#8208;C5H4NHOH]2[I7O18(OH)]&#8901;3&#8201;H2O (I), featuring a novel branched polyiodate chain has been obtained by evaporation method. [o&#8208;C5H4NHOH]2[I7O18(OH)]&#8901;3&#8201;H2O (I) crystalizes in the polar space group Ia and features an [I7O18(OH)]
 branched polyiodate chain in which [I3O9]3&#8722; trimers are grafted on the same side of the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chain based on [I4O11(OH)]3&#8722; tetramers. The asymmetric organic amine groups are beneficial to the polymerization of iodate groups and inducing the formation of the non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) structure. Compound I exhibits a rather large Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208; Generation (SHG) signal of 8.5&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP) upon 1064&#8197;nm laser radiation, a moderate band gap of 3.90&#8197;eV and a high laser&#8208;induced&#8208;damage&#8208;threshold (LIDT) of 182.34&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, hence it is a promising new SHG material. The relationship between the structures of the organic amine groups and the overall structures has been also analyzed.

         <title>Li2S6&#8208;Integrated PEO&#8208;Based Polymer Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li2S6 is used as an additive for a PEO&#8208;LiTFSI polymer electrolyte and serves to improve the Li+&#8208;ion conductivity of the electrolyte by reducing the crystalline volume in the PEO as well as aiding in the formation of a thin stable layer that stabilizes the interface with lithium metal. This leads to an impressive electrochemical performance at 40&#8201;&#176;C in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state full cells with a lithium metal anode and an LiFePO4 or LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode.







Abstract
The integration of Li2S6 within a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolyte is demonstrated to improve the polymer electrolyte's ionic conductivity because the strong interplay between O2&#8722;(PEO) and Li+ from Li2S6 reduces the crystalline volume within the PEO. The Li/electrolyte interface is stabilized by the in situ formation of an ultra&#8208;thin Li2S/Li2S2 layer via the reaction between Li2S6 and lithium metal, which increases the ionic transport at the interface and suppresses lithium dendrite growth. A symmetric Li/Li cell with the Li2S6&#8208;integrated composite electrolyte has excellent cyclability and a high critical current density of 0.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Impressive electrochemical performance is demonstrated with all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO4 and high&#8208;voltage Li/LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cells at 40&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Robust Molecular Dipole&#8208;Enabled Defect Passivation and Control of Energy&#8208;Level Alignment for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust route simultaneously allows effective defect passivation and reduced energy difference between the valence band edge of the perovskite and the highest occupied molecular orbital of the hole transport layer (HTL) via the judicious placement of strongly polar molecules at the perovskite/HTL interface.







Abstract
The ability to passivate defects and modulate the interface energy&#8208;level alignment (IEA) is key to boost the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we report a robust route that simultaneously allows defect passivation and reduced energy difference between perovskite and hole transport layer (HTL) via the judicious placement of polar chlorine&#8208;terminated silane molecules at the interface. Density functional theory (DFT) points to effective passivation of the halide vacancies on perovskite surface by the silane chlorine atoms. An integrated experimental and DFT study demonstrates that the dipole layer formed by the silane molecules decreases the perovskite work function, imparting an Ohmic character to the perovskite/HTL contact. The corresponding PSCs manifest a nearly 20&#8201;% increase in power conversion efficiency over pristine devices and a markedly enhanced device stability. As such, the use of polar molecules to passivate defects and tailor the IEA in PSCs presents a promising platform to advance the performance of PSCs.

         <title>Selective Separation of Hexachloroplatinate(IV) Dianions Based on Exo&#8208;Binding with Cucurbit[6]uril</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A instantaneous co&#8208;crystallization protocol relying on the selective recognition of the [PtCl6]2&#8722; dianions by the exo&#8208;binding of cucurbit[6]uril has been demonstrated. This protocol could be exploited to recover platinum from spent vehicular three&#8208;way catalytic converters and other platinum&#8208;bearing metal scrap in a fast, efficient, and highly selective manner.







Abstract
The recognition and separation of anions attracts attention from chemists, materials scientists, and engineers. Employing exo&#8208;binding of artificial macrocycles to selectively recognize anions remains a challenge in supramolecular chemistry. We report the instantaneous co&#8208;crystallization and concomitant co&#8208;precipitation between [PtCl6]2&#8722; dianions and cucurbit[6]uril, which relies on the selective recognition of these dianions through noncovalent bonding interactions on the outer surface of cucurbit[6]uril. The selective [PtCl6]2&#8722; dianion recognition is driven by weak [Pt&#8722;Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C] hydrogen bonding and [Pt&#8722;Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O] ion&#8211;dipole interactions. The synthetic protocol is highly selective. Recognition is not observed in combinations between cucurbit[6]uril and six other Pt&#8208; and Pd&#8208; or Rh&#8208;based chloride anions. We also demonstrated that cucurbit[6]uril is able to separate selectively [PtCl6]2&#8722; dianions from a mixture of [PtCl6]2&#8722;, [PdCl4]2&#8722;, and [RhCl6]3&#8722; anions. This protocol could be exploited to recover platinum from spent vehicular three&#8208;way catalytic converters and other platinum&#8208;bearing metal waste.

         <title>General &#945;&#8208;Amino 1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazole Synthesis via Late&#8208;Stage Reductive Functionalization of Tertiary Amides and Lactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An iridium&#8208;catalyzed reductive three&#8208;component coupling reaction for the synthesis of medicinally relevant &#945;&#8208;amino 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles from abundant tertiary amides or lactams, carboxylic acids, and (N&#8208;isocyanimino) triphenylphosphorane, is described. Proceeding under mild conditions using (&lt;1 mol%) Vaska&#8217;s complex (IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2) and tetramethyldisiloxane to access the key reactive iminium ion intermediates, a broad range of structurally complex &#945;&#8208;amino 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole architectures were efficiently accessed from diverse carboxylic acid feedstock coupling partners. Extension to &#945;&#8208;amino heterodiazole synthesis was readily achieved by exchanging the carboxylic acid coupling partner for C&#8208;, S&#8208;, or N&#8208;centered Br&#248;nsted acids, and provided rapid and modular access to these desirable, yet difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access, heterocycles. Furthermore, the high chemoselectivity of the catalytic reductive activation step allowed the late&#8208;stage functionalization of 10 drug molecules, including the synthesis of novel heterodiazole&#8208;fused drug&#8208;drug conjugates.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective C&#8722;F Bond Allylation of Trifluoromethylalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective C&#8722;F bond functionalization of CF3  group represents an appealing strategy for the incorporation of pharmaceutically privileged difluoromethylene moiety. Despite the recent significant advancement attained in the functionalization of Ar&#8208;CF3  molecules, prescriptions amenable for alkenyl&#8208;CF3  congeners remain sufficiently inadequate. Herein, we report a strategically novel protocol for the C&#8722;F bond elaboration of trifluoromethylalkene derivatives. By using readily available allyl metallics as nucleophilic coupling partner, the present reaction enables an expedient construction of structurally diversified CF2  &#8208;bridged 1,5&#8208;dienes. Furthermore, the exquisite selectivity observed in this transformation is revealed to be based on the underlying mechanism that consists of a cascade of nucleophilic SN2'&#160;defluorinative allylation and electronically promoted Cope rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Applying Machine Learning in Rechargeable Batteries from Microscale to Macroscale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emerging machine learning (ML) methodologies are widely applied in chemistry and materials science studies and are constructing a data&#8208;driven research paradigm. This review summarizes the applications of ML in rechargeable batteries from microscale to macroscale. Specifically, ML affords an emerging strategy to explore new functional for density functional theory calculations and new potentials for molecular dynamics simulations, which are expected to significantly enhance the challenging description concerning with interfaces or amorphous structures. Besides, ML possesses great potential to mine and unveil valuable information from both experimental and theoretical datasets. A quantitative &#8220;structure&#8211;function&#8221; correlation can thusly be established, the application of which includes predicting ionic conductivity of solids as well as forecasting battery lifespan. ML also exhibits great advantages in strategy optimization, such as fast&#8208;charge protocols. Lastly, an outlook on the future combination of multi&#8208;scale simulations, experiments, and ML is provided and the role of human in the data&#8208;driven research paradigm is highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Conversion of CO2 and Propargylamines Triggered by Triply Synergistic Catalytic Effect in MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclization of propargylamines with CO2 to obtain 2&#8208;oxazolidone heterocyclic compounds is an essential reaction in industry, but it is usually catalyzed by noble&#8208;metal catalysts with organic bases as co&#8208;catalyst under harsh conditions. Herein a unique Cu(I)/Cu(II) mixed valence copper&#8208;based framework {[(CuI6I5)Cu3IIL6(DMA)3](NO3)&#183;9DMA}n (1) with good solvent and thermal stability was synthesized, and high density of uncoordinated amino groups are evenly distributed in the large nanoscopic channels. Catalytic explorations show that 1 can effectively catalyze the reaction of propargylamines with CO2, and the yield can reach 99%. The turnover frequency (TOF) reaches a record value of 230 h&#8208;1, which is much higher than the reported noble&#8208;metal catalysts. Importantly, this is the first case that heterogeneous catalyst can catalyze the green conversion of propargylamines with CO2 without solvents and co&#8208;catalysts under low temperature and atmospheric pressure. The mechanism study shows that the triply synergistic catalytic effect among Cu(I)/Cu(II) and uncoordinated amino groups promote the high efficiency of the reaction and come true the green conversion of CO2. Furthermore, 1 also can directly catalyze this reaction with high efficiency when using the simulated flue gas as CO2 source. This work can inspire the design of more efficient catalysts in the green conversion of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Harvesting Supramolecular Phosphors: Highly Efficient Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Solution and Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution phase room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from organic phosphors is seldom realized. Herein we report one of the highest quantum yield solution state RTP (~41.8 %) in water, from a structurally simple phthalimide phosphor, by employing an organic&#8208;inorganic supramolecular scaffolding strategy. We further use these supramolecular hybrid phosphors as a light&#8208;harvesting scaffold to achieve delayed fluorescence from orthogonally anchored Sulforhodamine acceptor dyes via an efficient triplet to singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET), which is rarely achieved in solution. Electrostatic cross&#8208;linking of the inorganic scaffold at higher concentrations further facilitates the formation of self&#8208;standing hydrogels with efficient RTP and energy&#8208;transfer mediated long&#8208;lived fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell MFI zeolite synthesized using a simple di&#8208;quaternary ammonium structure&#8208;directing agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of a pentasil&#8208;type zeolite with ultra&#8208;small few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell crystalline domains, which we call FDP (few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell crystalline domain pentasil), is reported. FDP is made using bis&#8208;1,5(tributyl ammonium) pentamethylene cations as structure directing agent (SDA). This di&#8208;quaternary ammonium SDA combines (i) butyl ammonium, in place of the commonly used, for MFI synthesis, propyl ammonium, and (ii) a five&#8208;carbon nitrogen&#8208;connecting chain, in place of the six&#8208;carbon connecting chain SDAs that are known to fit well within the MFI pores. Although each modification, singularly implemented, is known to hinder nucleation and growth rates of MFI, they have not been, hitherto, combined to synergistically act on MFI morphology. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and electron microscopy imaging of FDP indicate ca. 10 nm crystalline domains organized in hierarchical micro&#8208;/meso&#8208;porous aggregates exhibiting mesoscopic order with an aggregate particle size that can be up to ca. 4 &#956;m. The synthesis of FDP is attributed to conflicting crystal shaping trends attributed to distinct moieties being incorporated in a single SDA. Specifically, the pentamethylene moiety is known to favor early crystal growth along the b&#8208;axis, while the butyl moieties are known to hinder growth along the b&#8208;axis. We attribute the obtained ultrasmall crystalline domains to the conflicting trends of the frustrated SDA. It is demonstrated that Al and Sn can be incorporated into the FDP zeolite framework to produce active and selective methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon and glucose isomerization catalysts, respectively.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Here we report on the design, synthesis, and assembly of an enzymatic programmable peptide system inspired by endocytic processes to induce molecular assemblies formation spatiotemporally in living cancer cells, resulting in glioblastoma cell death mainly in necroptosis. Our results indicate the stability and glycosylation of molecules play an essential role in determining the final bioactivity. Detailed mechanistic studies by CLSM, Flow cytometry, Western blot, and Bio&#8208;EM suggest the site&#8208;specific formation of assemblies, which could induce the LMP and activate the downstream cell death pathway. Moreover, we also demonstrate that our strategy can boost the activity of commercial chemotherapy drug by escaping lysosome sequestration. We expected this work would be expanded towards artificial intelligent biomaterials for cancer therapy and imaging precisely.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoresponsive Supramolecular Polypseudorotaxanes with Infinite Switching Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemoresponsive supramolecular systems with infinite switching capability are important for applications in recycled materials and intelligent devices. To attain this objective, here a chemoresponsive polypseudorotaxane is reported on the basis of a bis(  p  &#8208;phenylene)&#8211;34&#8211;crown&#8211;10 macrocycle (  H  ) and a cyano&#8208;substituted viologen guest (  G  ).  H  and  G  form a [2]pseudorotaxane (  H  &#8835;  G  ) both in solution and in the solid state. Upon addition of AgSF  6  , a polypseudorotaxane (denoted as [  H&#183;G&#183;  Ag]  n  ) forms as synergistically driven by host&#8211;guest complexation and metal&#8208;coordination interactions. [  H&#183;G&#183;  Ag]  n  depolymerizes into a [3]pseudorotaxane (denoted as  H  2  &#183;G&#183;  Ag  2  &#183;  acetone  2  ) upon addition of  H  and AgSF  6  , while it reforms with successive addition of  G  . The transformations between [  H&#183;G&#183;  Ag]  n  and  H  2  &#183;G&#183;  Ag  2  &#183;  acetone  2  can be switched for infinite cycles, superior to the conventional chemoresponsive supramolecular polymeric systems with limited switching capability. Therefore, by taking advantage of the adaptive macrocycle/guest complexation characters, the current study opens up new avenues toward precision engineering of chemoresponsive supramolecular polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Polymer Molecular Weight Distribution through a Latent Mediator Strategy with Temporal Programming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer molecular weight distribution (MWD) is a key parameter of polymers. Here we present a robust method for controlling polymer MWD in controlled cationic polymerizations. A latent mediator strategy was designed and combined with temporal programming to regenerate mediators at different times during polymerization. Both the breadths and shapes of MWD curves were tuned easily by adjusting an external light source. Bimodal, trimodal and tetramodal distributions were obtained, and the breadths could be varied from 1.06 to 2.09. Polymers with different MWDs prepared by this method had good chain end fidelity, which was demonstrated with successful chain&#8208;extension experiments. In addition, the introduction of temporal programming with a computer&#8208;controlled single chip for the light source opened an avenue for the use of artificial intelligence in polymer synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;C Cleavage of Benzocyclobutenones Enabled by a Blocking Strategy via Ni Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C activation remains a great challenge. The transformations of benzocyclobutenones (BCBs) usually involve the cleavage of C1&#8722;C2 bond. In this work, an unprecedented highly selective cleavage of C1&#8722;C8 bond with the insertion of alkynes is achieved by using blocking strategy via Ni catalysis, providing an efficient method for synthesis of 1,8&#8208;disubstituted naphthalenes. Notably, the blocking group could be readily removed after the transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Doubly Decorated Platinum&#8211;Gallium Intermetallics as Stable Catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising chemical process that can satisfy the increasing global demand for propylene. However, the Pt&#8208;based catalysts that have been reported thus far are typically deactivated at &#8805;600&#176;C by side reactions and coke formation. Thus, such catalysts possess an insufficient life. Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively. Pb is deposited on the three&#8208;fold Pt  3  sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron&#8208;enriched single&#8208;atom&#8208;like Pt  1  site, is placed around the nanoparticles. Thus, PtGa&#8211;Ca&#8211;Pb/SiO  2  exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600&#176;C (  k  d  = 0.00033 h  &#8722;1  ,  &#964;  = 3067 h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1 month for the first time.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>&#8220;Water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; (WIS) electrolytes using super&#8208;concentrated organic lithium (Li) salts are attracting tremendous interest for high energy aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries, owing to their wide electrochemical stability window that enables the application of high&#8208;energy electrode couples. However, the high salt cost, high viscosity, poor wettability and environmental hazards remain a great challenge. Herein, we present a &#8220;localized water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; (LWIS) electrolyte based on low&#8208;cost lithium nitrate (LiNO  3  ) salt and 1,5&#8208;pentanediol (PD) as inert diluent. The addition of PD not only maintains the solvation structure of the WIS electrolyte and improves the electrolyte stability via hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions with water and NO  3  &#8208;  molecules, but also dramatically reduces the total salt concentration. Furthermore, by in&#8208;situ gelling the LWIS electrolyte with tetraethylene glycol diacrylate (TEGDA) monomer, the electrolyte stability window can be further expanded to 3.0 V. The as&#8208;developed Mo  6  S  8  |LWIS gel electrolyte|LiMn  2  O  4  (LMO) batteries delivered outstanding cycling performance with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.53 % at after 250 cycles at 1 C.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen bonding tetraphenylethene anion receptors: anion&#8208;induced emissive aggregates and photoswitchable recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of tetraphenylethene (TPE) derivatives functionalized with highly potent electron deficient perfluoroaryl iodo&#8208;triazole halogen bond (XB) donors for anion recognition are reported.  1  H NMR titration experiments, fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering measurements, TEM imaging and X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis reveal that the tetra&#8208;substituted halogen bonding receptor forms luminescent nanoscale aggregates, the formation of which is driven by XB&#8208;mediated anion coordination. This anion&#8208;coordination induced aggregation effect serves as a powerful sensory mechanism, capable of luminescence chloride sensing at parts per billion concentration. Furthermore, the doubly substituted geometric isomers act as unprecedented photoswitchable XB donor anion receptors, where the composition of the photostationary state can be modulated by the presence of a coordinating halide anion.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Flow Z&#8208;stereoselective Olefin Metathesis: Development and Applications in the Synthesis of Pheromones and Macrocyclic Odorant Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first continuous flow Z&#8208;selective olefin metathesis process is reported. Key to realizing this process was the adequate choice of stereoselective catalysts combined with the design of an appropriate continuous reactor setup. The designed continuous process permits various self&#8208;, cross&#8208; and macro&#8208;ring&#8208;closing&#8208; metathesis reactions, delivering products in high selectivity and short residence times. This technique is exemplified by direct application to the preparation of a range of pheromones and macrocyclic odorant molecules and culminates in a telescoped Z&#8208;selective cross&#8208;metathesis/Dieckmann cyclisation sequence to access (Z)&#8208;Civetone, incorporating a serial array of continually stirred tank reactors.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopic Evidences of Key Intermediate Species and Role of NiFe Dual&#8208;Catalytic Center in Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NiFe&#8208;based electrocatalysts have attracted great interests due to the low price and high activity in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the complex reaction mechanism of NiFe&#8208;catalyzed OER has not been fully explored yet. Detection of intermediate species can bridge the gap between OER performances and catalyst component/structure properties. Here, we performed label&#8208;free surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopic (SERS) monitoring of interfacial OER process on Ni  3  FeO  x  nanoparticles (NPs) in alkaline medium. By using bifunctional Au@Ni  3  FeO  x  core&#8208;satellite superstructures as Raman signal enhancer, we found direct spectroscopic evidences from intermediate O&#8208;O  &#8208;  species. According to the SERS results, Fe atoms are the catalytic sites for the initial OH  &#8208;  to O&#8208;O  &#8208;  oxidation. The O&#8208;O  &#8208;  species adsorbed across neighboring Fe and Ni sites experiences further oxidation caused by electron transfer to Ni(III) and eventually forms O  2  product. This work shows spectroscopic evidence of interfacial intermediates and confirms the dual&#8208;metal&#8208;centered catalysis in OER on NiFe oxides, which may provide a guidance for rational design of high&#8208;performance OER electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Physicochemical Understanding of the Impact of Pore Environment and Species of Adsorbates on Adsorption Behaviour</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For better design of adsorbents, it is important to know the intermolecular interaction among adsorbates and host material, leading to improved guest selectivity and uptake capacity. In this study, we demonstrate the influence of the interaction among adsorbates and substrate, controlled by the pore environment and species of adsorbates, on the adsorption behaviour. Especially, we report the unique CO2 adsorption behaviour of MOF&#8208;205 due to distinct pore geometry. The precise analysis through gas adsorption crystallography with molecular simulation shows that capillary condensation of CO2 in MOF&#8208;205 occurs preferentially in the large dodecahedral pore rather than the small tetrahedral pore, because the interaction of CO2 with MOF&#8208;205 framework relatively weaker than that among CO2 molecules, while Ar and N2 are sequentially filled into two different pores of MOF&#8208;205 following their size. Comparison of the materials with different pore environments reveals that the relative strength of the adsorbate&#8208;adsorbate and adsorbate&#8208;substrate interaction gives rise to different shapes of isotherm, which can lead to a detailed physicochemical understanding of the adsorption behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>RNA&#8208;cleaving deoxyribozymes differentiate methylated cytidine isomers in RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deoxyribozymes are emerging as modification&#8208;specific endonucleases for the analysis of epigenetic RNA modifications. Here, we report RNA&#8208;cleaving deoxyribozymes that differentially respond to the presence of natural methylated cytidines, 3&#8208;methylcytidine (m3C), N4&#8208;methylcytidine (m4C), and 5&#8208;methyl&#173;cytidine (m5C), respectively. Using in vitro selection, we found several DNA catalysts, which are selectively activated by only one of the three cytidine isomers, and display 10&#8208; to 30&#8208;fold accelerated cleavage of their target m3C&#8208;, m4C&#8208; or m5C&#8208;modified RNA. An additional deoxy&#173;ribozyme is strongly inhibited by any of the three methylcytidines, but effectively cleaves unmodified RNA. The mXC&#8208;detecting deoxy&#173;ribozymes are program&#173;able for the interrogation of natural RNAs of interest, as demonstrated for human mitochondrial tRNAs containing known m3C and m5C sites. The results underline the potential of synthetic functional DNA to shape highly selective active sites</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;induced &#8220;molecular piping&#8221; of cyclic peptide nanotubes to form bent tubular structures is described. The process is based on the [4+4] photocycloaddition of anthracene moieties, whose structural changes derived from the interdigitated flat disposition of precursors to the corresponding cycloadduct moieties, induced the geometrical modifications in nanotubes packing that provokes their curvature. For this purpose, we designed a new class of cyclic peptide nanotubes formed by&#160;b&#8208; and&#160;a&#8208;amino acids. The presence of the former predisposes the peptide to stack in a parallel fashion with the&#160;b&#8208;residues aligned along the nanotube and the homogeneous distribution of anthracene pendants.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalently Aligned MoS2&#8208;CNTs Hetero&#8208;Architecture for High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advanced 2D nanosheets architectures that fundamentally promote ions dynamic transportation and storage capacity, are significantly pivotal for high&#8208;performance electrochemical capacitors (ECs). However, the restacking microstructure, weak interlayer conduction and blocked electroactive utilization usually lead to a low energy density. Herein, we develop an ordered hetero&#8208;architecture of MoS  2  &#8208;CNTs, in which CNTs are vertically grafted within MoS  2  framework by C&#8208;Mo covalent bond. Benefiting from this  in situ  vertical&#8208;bridge, high&#8208;speed interlaminar conductivity, unimpeded ions&#8208;diffusion channels and sufficient pseudocapacitive reactivity, the MoS  2  &#8208;CNTs presents ultra&#8208;large capacitance (5485 F g  &#8208;1  ) and good structural stability in KOH electrolyte. Moreover, the all&#8208;unified solid&#8208;state flexible ECs via direct&#8208;write printing construction deliver high energy density (226 mWh g  &#8208;1  ), good capacitance (723 F g  &#8208;1  ) and stable high/low temperature operating ability. Specifically, the flexible ECs can efficiently power display and wearable health monitoring device, which opens up a prominent way to design new multi&#8208;structural electrodes for next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage technology and wearable applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Brush Surfactants: Versatile Emulsifiers for Stabilizing and Structuring Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using amphiphilic molecular brushes to stabilize emulsions usually requires the synthesis of specific side chains, which can be a time&#8208;consuming and difficult challenge to meet. By taking advantage of the electrostatic interactions between water&#8208;soluble molecular brushes and oil&#8208;soluble oligomeric ligands, the in&#8208;situ formation, assembly and jamming of molecular brush surfactants (MBSs) at the oil&#8208;water interface is described. With MBSs, stable emulsions including o/w, w/o and o/w/o can be easily prepared by varying the molar ratios of the molecular brushes to the ligands. Moreover, when jammed, the binding energy of MBSs at the interface is sufficiently strong to allow the stabilization of liquids in nonequilibrium shapes, i.e., structuring liquids, producing an elastic film at the interface with exceptional mechanical properties. These structured liquids have numerous potential applications, including chemical biphasic reactions, liquid electronics, and all&#8208;liquid biomimetic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Integration of Bimetallic Electronic Synergy with Oxide Site Isolation for Boosting Selective Hydrogenation of Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene is an important process to purify ethylene streams in industry. However, among current approaches reported in literature, high ethylene selectivity has been generally achieved at large expense of activity. Here we show that Ga  2  O  3  coating of Ag@Pd core&#8208;shell bimetallic particle catalysts, allows improving the ethylene selectivity to a much greater extent than coating of monometallic Pd particles, while preserving a remarkable intrinsic activity, about 50 times higher than the benchmark catalyst of Pd  1  Ag single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs). Importantly, the resulting catalyst also shows excellent long&#8208;term stability, by suppressing coke formation efficiently. Spectroscopic characterization reveals that weakened ethylene adsorption by bimetallic electronic synergy, and oxide site isolation are both essential for the high ethylene selectivity and high&#8208;coking resistance. H&#8208;D exchange measurements further show that the Ga  2  O  3  &#8208;coated Ag@Pd catalyst possesses a much higher activity of H  2  activation than that of Pd  1  Ag SAAs, thus boosting the hydrogenation activity at the same time.</dc:description>

Importantly, the resulting catalyst also shows excellent long-term stability, by suppressing coke formation efficiently. Spectroscopic characterization reveals that weakened ethylene adsorption by bimetallic electronic synergy, and oxide site isolation are both essential for the high ethylene selectivity and high-coking resistance. H-D exchange measurements further show that the Ga  2  O  3  -coated Ag@Pd catalyst possesses a much higher activity of H  2  activation than that of Pd  1  Ag SAAs, thus boosting the hydrogenation activity at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
