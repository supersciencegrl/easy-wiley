         <title>Yb2&#8208;Tb Upconversion in a Hetero&#8208;Trimetallic Molecular Lanthanide Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanides are at the forefront of photon upconversion in molecular systems; however, the chemical nature of the lanthanides makes site&#8208;specific coordination chemistry difficult to achieve. Here, we employ kinetically stabile building blocks to achieve hetero&#8208;trimetallic 4f complexes with complete site&#8208;specific chemical control. We observe efficient Yb2 &#8594; Tb upconversion in aqueous solution despite relatively long intermetallic distances.








ABSTRACT
Photon Upconversion in molecular hetero&#8208;metallic lanthanide systems is challenged by the lack of chemical diversity displayed by the lanthanide ions. Here, we report the multi&#8208;photon photophysical properties of a series of molecular hetero&#8208;trimetallic lanthanide complexes Yb2Ln (Ln = Eu3+, Gd3+, Tb3+) assembled from kinetically inert building blocks providing site&#8208;specific chemical control regarding introduction of differing lanthanide ions. The hetero&#8208;trimetallic complex Yb2Tb shows efficient Yb2 &#8594; Tb photon upconversion via cooperative sensitization in both D2O and H2O. By contrast, Yb2Eu does not show Yb2 &#8594; Eu upconversion, while Yb2Gd has been used as a spectroscopic blank. We find that the Yb2 &#8594; Tb energy transfer appears to be independent of OH quenching from the solvent. Additionally, we report the intermetallic distances in the complex using density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the Yb2 &#8594; Tb cooperative sensitization upconversion energy transfer remains effective despite relatively long intermetallic distances between donor pairs (13.5&#8211;25 &#197;) and between the Yb donors and the Tb acceptor (11.5&#8211;13.5 &#197;).

         <title>Highly Tough, Notch&#8208;Insensitive, and Fast Self&#8208;Healing Thermoplastic Polyurethane Elastomers by Tailored Soft Segment Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring the molecular architecture of soft segments enables thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers to overcome the trade&#8208;off between toughness, notch insensitivity, and self&#8208;healing. Incorporation of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxyl end&#8208;functionalized poly(2&#8208;ethylhexyl acrylate) with bulky, flexible, low&#8208;glass&#8208;transition side chains suppress strain&#8208;induced domain disruption, stabilizes crack propagation, and enhances energy dissipation, yielding elastomers that combine exceptional mechanical robustness with rapid autonomous healing.








ABSTRACT
Achieving toughness, notch insensitivity, and self&#8208;healing within a single thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) system is challenging. Hard domains formed by hydrogen&#8208;bonded urethane linkages provide mechanical strength but limit the chain mobility needed for healing, while soft domains enable elasticity but are more vulnerable to damage. We propose a soft&#8208;segment modification strategy that incorporates &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxyl end&#8208;functionalized polyacrylates into conventional TPU structures. Unlike our previous systems based on linear&#8208;alkyl acrylates (i.e., n&#8208;butyl acrylate), introducing branched&#8208;alkyl acrylic soft segments (i.e., 2&#8208;ethylhexyl acrylate) generate side&#8208;chain architectures whose segmental dynamics respond more sensitively to temperature. This enhanced thermal responsiveness promotes thermally activated chain mobility and more uniform stress distribution, all without compromising the mechanical contribution of the hard domains. As a result, the acrylic TPUs display high toughness (186 MJ&#183;m&#8722;3), stable notch performance (fracture energy &gt;197 kJ&#183;m&#8722;2 at elongations above 900%), and practical self&#8208;healing (&#8764;90% recovery at 45&#176;C within 3&#160;h). These findings highlight that branched polyacrylate&#8211;based soft&#8208;segment engineering offers a balanced pathway to mechanically robust and adaptable TPU elastomers.

         <title>The Diarylprolinol Silyl Ethers: After 20 Years Still Opening New Doors in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalysis Rules! The year 2025 marks the 20th anniversary of diarylprolinol silyl ethers in asymmetric organocatalysis. During the first decade after their discovery, these catalysts have been established as one of the most versatile tools in aminocatalysis. Although now considered mature, recent years have witnessed renewed innovation. We outlined these developments, demonstrating that this remains a rapidly evolving field.








ABSTRACT
A new chapter starts now. Since its discovery in 2005, the diarylprolinol silyl ether catalytic concept has emerged as a general and reliable aminocatalytic tool for the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules. Recently its combination with emerging technologies, as well as its application in more complex molecular systems has opened new avenues for novel enantioenriched scaffolds. In this review, we will highlight these recent developments, unfolding five primary categories that define new horizons in the use of diarylprolinol silyl ethers: Photochemical&#8208;, electrochemical&#8208;, dual&#8208;catalytic transformations, higher&#8208;order cycloadditions and applications in total synthesis of complex natural products.

         <title>Lipid Modified with Pyridinium Betaine Manipulates Liposomal Membrane Fusion Behavior for Spatially Confined Cytoplasmic Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;adaptive, environment&#8208;responsive fusogenic liposome (SENDFUL) was developed to switch fusion on/off reversibly in response to tumor acidity. This precise spatial control over membrane fusion allows for safe and efficient cytosolic delivery of STING agonist, potentiating a potent antitumor efficacy with minimal toxicity.








Abstract
Spatially confining the membrane&#8208;fusion effects of fusogenic delivery systems in tumors can enhance therapeutic efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity. However, current existing fusion&#8208;regulating strategies often suffer from insensitivity and unidirectional control, leading to suboptimal antitumor effects and potential safety risks. Here, we designed a pyridinium betaine&#8208;capped lipid, 2&#8208;(4&#8208;((2,3&#8208;di(stearoyloxy)propyl)carbamoyl)pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium&#8208;1&#8208;yl)acetate (DSPCPA)), as a pH&#8208;responsive regulator to precisely manipulate the membrane&#8208;fusion behavior of fusogenic liposomes. Incorporating DSPCPA, we optimized a formulation of self&#8208;adaptive, environment&#8208;responsive fusogenic liposome (SENDFUL) capable of rapidly and reversibly switching membrane&#8208;fusion activity responding acidic tumor microenvironments. At physiological pH, SENDFUL remains negatively&#8208;charged due to the zwitterionic nature of DSPCPA, undergoing in a non&#8208;fusogenic state. In acidic tumor regions (pH 6.5), protonation of DSPCPA rapidly converts surface charge to positive, triggering tumor&#8208;specific fusion via strengthened electrostatic interactions with cellular membranes. This reversible transition highly confines lysosome&#8208;bypassing cytosolic delivery to tumors, minimizing systemic toxicity. We utilized SENDFUL to construct a nanoagonist for the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, which elicited potent antitumor immunity with negligible toxicity in vitro and in vivo. Thus, SENDFUL represents an advanced strategy for spatially precise regulation of liposomal membrane fusion, providing a safe and efficient platform for tumor&#8208;specific intracellular drug delivery.

Here, we designed a pyridinium betaine-capped lipid, 2-(4-((2,3-di(stearoyloxy)propyl)carbamoyl)pyridin-1-ium-1-yl)acetate (DSPCPA)), as a pH-responsive regulator to precisely manipulate the membrane-fusion behavior of fusogenic liposomes. Incorporating DSPCPA, we optimized a formulation of &lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;elf-a&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;aptive, &lt;b&gt;en&lt;/b&gt;vironment-responsive &lt;b&gt;fu&lt;/b&gt;sogenic &lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;iposome (SENDFUL) capable of rapidly and reversibly switching membrane-fusion activity responding acidic tumor microenvironments. At physiological pH, SENDFUL remains negatively-charged due to the zwitterionic nature of DSPCPA, undergoing in a non-fusogenic state. In acidic tumor regions (pH 6.5), protonation of DSPCPA rapidly converts surface charge to positive, triggering tumor-specific fusion via strengthened electrostatic interactions with cellular membranes. This reversible transition highly confines lysosome-bypassing cytosolic delivery to tumors, minimizing systemic toxicity. We utilized SENDFUL to construct a nanoagonist for the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, which elicited potent antitumor immunity with negligible toxicity in vitro and in vivo. Thus, SENDFUL represents an advanced strategy for spatially precise regulation of liposomal membrane fusion, providing a safe and efficient platform for tumor-specific intracellular drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Molecular Locking Through Sodium&#8208;Integrated Cross&#8208;Linkable Scaffold Enables Durable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a molecular locking strategy combining in situ thermal ring&#8208;opening polymerization of sodium lipoate with Na+ interstitial doping. This regulates crystallization kinetics and suppresses ion migration, yielding large&#8208;grained, highly crystalline perovskite films. TANA&#8208;modified devices achieve 26.90% (certified 26.75%) and retain 92.3% performance after 1000&#160;h MPPT treacking. The method demonstrates excellent scalability, producing 10.24&#160;cm2 minimodules with 23.00% efficiency and 96.5% geometric fill factor.








ABSTRACT
The primary challenge in commercializing perovskite solar cells (PSCs) mainly stems from undesired non&#8208;radiative recombination loss and defect&#8208;mediated migration of halide perovskite materials. Herein, we propose a synergistic stabilization strategy integrating in situ polymerization with sodium interstitial doping to concurrently regulate crystallization kinetics and suppress ion migration. The cross&#8208;linked scaffold formed by sodium thioctate (TANA) templates high&#8208;quality perovskite growth through retarded crystallization and suppressed nucleation, while Na+ dopants occupying interstitial sites effectively reduce electron&#8211;phonon coupling and alleviate the lattice microstrain. Additional coordination and hydrogen bonding between TANA and the perovskite facilitate the suppression of iodide and lead vacancy defects, reinforcing the driving forces for carrier extraction and transfer. As a result, the optimized device yields a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.90% (certified 26.75%), along with excellent long&#8208;term stability, retaining 92.3% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h under continuous operation (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2I). Remarkably, a minimodule with an aperture area of 10.24&#160;cm2 also achieves a remarkable PCE of 23.0%, underscoring the industrial potential of this multifunctional stabilization approach.

         <title>Interfacial d&#8208;Band Center Modulation via Si&#8211;Ir Coupling Enables Efficient and Durable Acidic Solar Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acid&#8208;resistant SiOx not only mitigates surface defects on hematite as a passivation layer but also acts as an electron donor to suppress Ir oxidation, thereby inhibiting the formation of soluble IrO42&#8722; species. Consequently, the hematite photoanode fabricated via the synergistic action of SiOx and the IrOx cocatalyst achieves efficient and durable oxygen evolution in acidic solar water splitting.








ABSTRACT
The pursuit of efficient and stable photoelectrochemical water oxidation in acidic media is impeded by issues of severe photo&#8208;corrosion and sluggish reaction kinetics. This study presents a novel dual&#8208;modification approach for hematite (&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3) photoanodes, incorporating an acid&#8208;resistant silicon oxide (SiOx) passivation layer and an interconnected iridium oxide (IrOx) cocatalyst. The optimized Fe2O3&#8208;Si/Ir photoanode achieves a record photocurrent density of 2.32&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 VRHE in acidic electrolyte, along with exceptional stability over 60 min, significantly surpassing all previously reported hematite&#8208;based systems under acidic conditions. A key innovation lies in the multifunctional role of the SiOx overlayer, which not only passivates surface states to improve bulk charge separation but also promotes the formation of a uniform IrOx network and inhibits over&#8208;oxidation of Ir to soluble high valent species (e.g., IrO42&#8211;). Combined experimental and theoretical evidence reveals strong electronic interaction at the Si&#8211;Ir interface, modulating the d&#8208;band center of Ir, enhancing interfacial charge transfer, and reducing the Gibbs free energies of the rate&#8208;determining step in water oxidation. This work establishes a synergistic materials design strategy for highly efficient and durable solar water splitting in acidic environments, offering a viable route toward practical solar hydrogen production.

         <title>Relay Storage of Protons and Zinc Ions Enables Practical High&#8208;Mass&#8208;Loading Organic Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of Zn&#8208;organic batteries are often achieved at low mass loadings. Herein, we reveal the dynamic relay storage mechanism of proton and zinc ions of poly(benzoquinonyl sulfide) (PBQS) electrodes working in 0.5 m Zn(OTf)2 + 17 m NaClO4 electrolyte. Benefiting from this mechanism and its high conductivity, a PBQS electrode can deliver an areal capacity of 18 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 100&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, which surpasses that of previously reported organic electrodes.








ABSTRACT
Rechargeable Zn&#8211;organic batteries hold great promise for sustainable energy storage, yet most reported high performances are achieved only at low mass loadings (2&#8211;3&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), far from practical application. Here, we investigate poly(benzoquinonyl sulfide) (PBQS) electrodes working in a water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolyte and reveal that PBQS first undergoes faradaic proton insertion during discharge, which is subsequently displaced by Zn2+, releasing protons back into the electrolyte. This dynamic relay allows a small amount of H+ to cycle repeatedly, acting as a kinetic buffer that offset the sluggish diffusion of Zn2+. Owing to this mechanism and PBQS's high conductivity, a low&#8208;carbon (10&#160;wt.%) PBQS electrode with an ultrahigh mass loading of 100&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 delivers a capacity of 187.1 mAh g&#8722;1 (&#8764;96% of low&#8208;loading capacity) and achieves a record areal capacity of 18 mAh cm&#8722;2. The electrode also exhibits excellent rate capability and cycling stability, suggesting its strong potential for practical applications.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Reduction of Allenes to Access Deuterated Allylic Isotopomers, Isotopologs and Enantioisotopomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular and Precise Deuteration: The synthesis of molecules precisely deuterated at allylic, vinylic or both positions remains a challenging task. This work discloses a modular semi&#8208;reductive deuteration that enables the synthesis of various isotopologs including precisely labeled d1&#8208;, d2&#8208;, d3&#8208;, d5&#8208;, and d7&#8208;products. The method was extended to achieve chirality transfer to make d1&#8208;allylic enantioisotopomers with high enantiopurity, which were analyzed using chiral&#8208;tag MRR spectroscopy for measuring enantiomeric excess and assigning absolute configuration. 








ABSTRACT
Selectively deuterated compounds represent high value synthetic targets with applications across many scientific disciplines. Despite their importance, reactions that enable access to products precisely deuterated at an allylic position with complete control over the degree of deuteration are extremely rare. In fact, the high enantiopurity synthesis of enantioisotopomers owing their chirality solely to hydrogen isotopes at an allylic position has remained elusive to date. Herein, we report a modular Cu&#8208;catalyzed semi&#8208;reductive deuteration of allenes to access a broad scope of small molecules, drug analogs, and natural product analogs precisely deuterated at allylic positions. The semi&#8208;reduction strategy has been applied to access a range of precisely labeled d1&#8208;, d2&#8208;, d3&#8208;, d5&#8208;, and d7&#8208;isotopologs. In this work, we disclose the first high enantiopurity synthesis of allylic&#8208;d1 enantioisotopomers, along with a highly accurate and precise analysis for enantiomeric excess (EE) determination and assignment of absolute configuration (AC) using molecular rotational resonance (MRR) spectroscopy.

The semi-reduction strategy has been applied to access a range of precisely labeled &lt;i&gt;d1&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;d2&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;d3&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;d5&lt;/i&gt;-, and &lt;i&gt;d7&lt;/i&gt;-isotopologs. In this work, we disclose the first high enantiopurity synthesis of allylic-&lt;i&gt;d1&lt;/i&gt; enantioisotopomers, along with a highly accurate and precise analysis for enantiomeric excess (EE) determination and assignment of absolute configuration (AC) using molecular rotational resonance (MRR) spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Au42(PET)32 Nanocluster Sensitizer Unlocks the Annihilator Potential of Rubrene, Enabling High&#8208;Performance NIR&#8208;to&#8208;Visible Photon Upconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A needle&#8208;shaped gold nanocluster, Au42(PET)32, serves as a powerful triplet sensitizer, enabling rubrene to fully express its intrinsic annihilator capability (spin statistical factor f&#160;= 0.58). This sensitizer&#8211;annihilator pair achieves record&#8208;high upconversion internal quantum yields of 21.4% (808&#160;nm excitation) and 15.0% (936&#160;nm excitation), showcasing the emerging role of gold nanoclusters in triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation photon upconversion.








ABSTRACT
Photon upconversion (UC) via triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation enables the conversion of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photons into visible light, offering opportunities for solar energy harvesting, photocatalysis, and biophotonics. However, progress has been limited by the lack of triplet sensitizers capable of fully exploiting rubrene, the representative annihilator/emitter for NIR&#8208;to&#8208;visible UC. Here, we report Au42(PET)32 (Au42; PET&#160;= 2&#8208;phenylethanethiolate), a highly anisotropic, needle&#8208;shaped gold nanocluster that unlocks the annihilator potential of rubrene, enabling high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;to&#8208;visible UC. The Au42/rubrene pair achieves record&#8208;setting UC quantum yields (&#934;UC, 50% maximum) of 16.5% (reabsorption&#8208;corrected quantum yield &#934;UCg of 21.4%) with a low threshold intensity (Ith) of 0.14&#160;W cm&#8722;2 under 808&#160;nm excitation and 12.3% (&#934;UCg&#160;= 15.0%) under 936&#160;nm excitation&#8212;over two orders of magnitude higher than previously reported values above 850&#160;nm. Quantitative analysis revealed a high spin&#8208;statistical factor (f&#160;= 0.58) for rubrene, suggesting an attainable &#934;UC maximum of &#8764;30% in rubrene&#8208;based systems. The remarkable performances arise from the unique electronic structure of Au42, which combines strong NIR absorption with high visible transparency, minimizing losses of the S1 annihilator and the UC photons. These findings establish Au42 as a benchmark sensitizer and exemplify a design principle for realizing highly efficient, low&#8208;threshold NIR&#8208;to&#8208;visible UC.

         <title>Multivariate Hierarchies in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivariate hierarchical metal&#8211;organic frameworks feature both sequentially ordered hierarchical pores (from micropores to mesopores to macropores) and hierarchically organized chemical compositions (in the form of distinct functional layers). The elegant synergy between these gradients opens new avenues in bionics. 








ABSTRACT
Hierarchy is one of the fundamental laws that governs nature, where ordered structures&#8212;from plant roots to human skin&#8212;optimize mass and energy flow through precisely hierarchical pores and chemical compositions. Mimicking this intricate design in artificial materials has remained elusive, as achieving simultaneous, precisely control over both pore architecture and chemical composition hierarchies within a single system posed great challenges. In this work, by developing a facile nanoemulsion&#8208;based post&#8208;synthetic strategy, we break this barrier and achieve multivariate hierarchies in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) single crystal, enabling the first creation of MOF with simultaneously sequentially ordered hierarchical pores (micropores&#8594;mesopores&#8594;macropores) and hierarchical chemical compositions (distinct functional layers). This true biomimicry showcase promoted charge transfer efficiency and accelerated reaction kinetics which are similar to the natural systems. In addition, novel multivariate hierarchies like &#8220;multi&#8208;element hierarchical pores&#8221; for multifunctionality and &#8220;cross&#8208;linked hierarchical pores&#8221; for pore structural hybridization can be also created, transcending traditional material limits. By mirroring nature's hierarchical genius at the nano world, this work establishes a paradigm for the next&#8208;generation bio&#8208;inspired materials with life&#8208;like efficiency and complexity.

         <title>A Breakthrough in Formic Acid Oxidation by a Dual&#8208;Atomic Ir&#8211;N4/Pt&#8211;N4 Catalyst via Parallel Reaction Pathways Under Over&#8208;Boiling Point Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a dual&#8208;atomic Ir&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4 catalyst that establishes parallel reaction pathways including Pt activates H adsorption while Ir binds carbonyl groups. Combined with over&#8208;boiling point operation that disrupts inhibitory hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, it achieves a record mass activity of 125.9 A mg&#8722;1 for formic acid oxidation, far surpassing that ofconventional catalysts.








ABSTRACT
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) suffer from sluggish desorption&#8208;charge transfer processes during complex multi&#8208;atomic molecule oxidation (e.g., C/H/O&#8208;containing species) due to simple active sites and tedious carbonyl/C&#9472;H bond tandem oxidation pathways. Herein, we propose a new atomically dispersed Ir&#8211;N4/Pt&#8211;N4 catalyst (Ir1&#8211;Pt1 NC) to construct efficient dual&#8208;pathway reactions as directional parallel reactions, namely, Pt activates H adsorption while adjacent Ir sites specifically bind carbonyl groups (C&#9552;O) under the over&#8208;boiling point environment. The confirmed Ir&#8211;N4/Pt&#8211;N4 dual&#8208;isolated coordination structure modulates the d&#8208;band center to achieve greatly reduced energy barrier and form a new parallel dual&#8208;pathway mechanism, significantly improving catalytic kinetics and boosting the charge transfer process. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that strong hydrogen bond networks in formic acid (FA) solutions impede molecular diffusion, where over&#8208;boiling point operation significantly weakens the hydrogen bonding of FA molecules, thus realizing a &#8220;double &#215; double&#8221; enhancement effect. The &#8220;dual&#8208;atomic catalyst with over&#8208;boiling point hydrogen bond dissociation&#8221; strategy achieve an unprecedented catalytic performance, that is, a mass activity of 125.9 A mg&#8722;1, far exceeding those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art single atomic catalysts (10&#8211;30 A mg&#8722;1) and the commercial iridium&#8208;carbon (Ir/C) catalyst (0.1 A mg&#8722;1), and building a new universal &#8220;structure + environment&#8221; dual&#8208;regulation for formic acid oxidation (FAOR) and the rapid degradation of other small organic molecules.

         <title>Homochiral Indium&#8208;Oxo Clusters With Multichromatic Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the first intrinsically CPL&#8208;active chiral indium&#8208;oxo&#8208;clusters (cInOCs), which self&#8208;assemble into helical structures and enable highly tunable, amplified CPL in cInOCs@Dyes composites&#8212;achieving a dissymmetry factor glum of up to 0.037&#8212;that can be processed into flexible PDMS films for photonic applications.








ABSTRACT
The development of chiral main&#8208;group metal&#8208;oxo clusters (MOCs) exhibiting high&#8208;performance circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) remains a significant challenge. This study presents a generalizable strategy to successfully synthesize a series of chiral indium&#8208;oxo clusters (cInOCs). These cInOCs can further self&#8208;assemble into supramolecular absolute helices through intermolecular interactions, exhibiting strong chirality and intense blue CPL with a dissymmetry factor glum of 0.012&#8211;0.013. To our knowledge, these cInOCs represent the first intrinsically CPL&#8208;active main&#8208;group MOCs, whose performance rivals or surpasses that of previously reported dye&#8208;doped chiral main&#8208;group MOCs systems. Capitalizing on the substantial pore channels within the cInOCs, green and yellow fluorescent dye molecules were encapsulated in situ, yielding cInOCs@Dyes composites with color&#8208;tunable CPL properties. Efficient chirality transfer from the cInOC host to the guest dyes led to enhanced and tunable photoluminescence, alongside highly adjustable and amplified CPL. A maximum glum of 0.037 was attained, approximately three times greater than that of the pristine cInOCs. Furthermore, the successful processability of these cInOCs or cInOCs@Dyes composites into flexible, transparent films highlights their considerable potential for practical applications in optical and photonic devices.

These cInOCs can further self-assemble into supramolecular absolute helices through intermolecular interactions, exhibiting strong chirality and intense blue CPL with a dissymmetry factor &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.012&#8211;0.013. To our knowledge, these cInOCs represent the first intrinsically CPL-active main-group MOCs, whose performance rivals or surpasses that of previously reported dye-doped chiral main-group MOCs systems. Capitalizing on the substantial pore channels within the cInOCs, green and yellow fluorescent dye molecules were encapsulated in situ, yielding cInOCs@Dyes composites with color-tunable CPL properties. Efficient chirality transfer from the cInOC host to the guest dyes led to enhanced and tunable photoluminescence, alongside highly adjustable and amplified CPL. A maximum &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.037 was attained, approximately three times greater than that of the pristine cInOCs. Furthermore, the successful processability of these cInOCs or cInOCs@Dyes composites into flexible, transparent films highlights their considerable potential for practical applications in optical and photonic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrical Sensitive Trianthracene Nanoparticle for Afterglow Imaging Epileptic Abnormal Discharges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop an afterglow&#8208;based imaging strategy for in vivo imaging of cumulative abnormal electrical discharges in epileptic brains by using TA nanoparticles (TA&#8208;NPs). TA&#8208;NPs exhibit a turn&#8208;off afterglow response to seizure&#8208;associated currents while remaining stable under normal neuronal activity, enabling the study of accumulated epileptic discharges.








Abstract
Abnormal discharge during epileptic seizures monitoring is essential for epilepsy treatment, but current imaging methods present challenges. In this study, we developed afterglow nanoparticles (TA&#8208;NPs), composed of a trianthracene derivative (TA) and amphiphilic polymer PSMA, for in vivo detection of cumulative abnormal brain discharge in epilepsy models. TA&#8208;NPs exhibit the ability to respond to external current stimulation, along with a turn&#8208;off trend in the afterglow intensity, while keeping intact under normal neuronal activity. Application in an acute epilepsy model demonstrated that afterglow intensity correlated with current parameters in the brain, aligning with in vitro results. Furthermore, curcumin pretreatment reduced epileptic discharge and led to distinguishable changes in the afterglow response of TA&#8208;NPs, confirming their sensitivity to cumulative electrical abnormalities. These nanoparticles offer a promising tool for studying abnormal electrical discharges accumulated in the brain of epilepsy.

         <title>From Covalent Traps to Fluorescent Beacons: The Expanding Arsenal of Chemical Probes for Studying Ubiquitin and Ubiquitin&#8208;Like Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

A large variety of chemistry&#8208;based ubiquitin probes have been developed.








ABSTRACT
Ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin&#8208;like proteins (Ubls) orchestrate diverse cellular processes through reversible post&#8208;translational modification of target proteins. Their conjugation is governed by a cascade of E1 activating, E2 conjugating, and E3 ligating enzymes, while deconjugation is mediated by deubiquitinases (DUBs) and Ubl&#8208;specific proteases. Profiling the catalytic activity of these enzymes is essential for understanding the dynamics and specificity of Ub/Ubl signaling. Activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) have emerged as powerful tools to covalently label active enzymes through electrophilic warheads that target catalytic residues. Unlike conventional affinity&#8208;based approaches, ABPs capture functional states of enzymes in complex biological systems. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of ABPs designed for the Ub/Ubl signal pathways, encompassing probes for Ub, SUMO, NEDD8, ISG15, FAT10, UFM1, URM1, Atg8&#8208;family modifiers, and FUBI (MNSF&#946;). We discuss key elements of probe design, including recognition domains, electrophilic warheads (e.g., vinyl sulfones, vinyl methyl esters, propargylamine, azapeptide esters), and detection tags. Particular emphasis is placed on emerging azapeptide ester&#8208;based probes, which structurally mimic native enzyme&#8208;substrate intermediates and offer high selectivity and reactivity. ABPs targeting E1, E2, and HECT/RBR E3 ligases are also highlighted, expanding their utility beyond classical DUB profiling. We further compare warhead chemistries, enzyme selectivity, and labeling strategies, and examine structural insights derived from probe&#8208;enzyme complexes. Collectively, these tools have transformed our ability to interrogate Ub/Ubl&#8208;regulating enzymes in vitro and in cells. The review concludes with perspectives on next&#8208;generation probe development, including cell&#8208;permeable designs, spatiotemporal control, and applications in systems biology and drug discovery.

         <title>Reducing Interface Energy Loss of Perovskite Solar Cells by Molecular Engineering of Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a new hole&#8208;transporting material (WD03) designed via molecular engineering to regulate defect passivation and energy&#8208;level alignment in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The propeller&#8208;shaped structure ensures balanced charge transport and film quality. Consequently, WD03&#8208;based devices deliver a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.194 V under doped conditions and achieve an efficiency of 23.66% in dopant&#8208;free devices with surface modification, underscoring the importance of molecular design for high&#8208;performance and stable PSCs.








ABSTRACT
Numerous novel hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) have been reported in the literature, which play a vital role in enhancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the PSCs using these HTMs continue to suffer from exciton recombination induced by energy level misalignment and defect states. Herein, an ingenious molecular design for HTMs (WD03 with triphenylethylene and WD04 with trithienylethylene) is reported to modulate their energy levels and passivation effectively. The optimal band alignment between WD03 and perovskite is crucial for enhancing the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc), which minimizes the interface carrier recombination. The theoretical analysis reveals that replacing thiophene with benzene enhances the passivation ability of HTM, resulting in a more substantial passivation effect on the Pb&#8208;cluster defect of perovskite. These factors contribute to a high Voc (1.194&#160;V) of WD03&#8208;based cell, ranking among the highest values for n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs with a normal bandgap perovskite absorber. Moreover, the propeller&#8208;shaped WD03 strikes an excellent balance between charge transport and film quality. Owing to these advantages, the PSC based on dopant&#8208;free WD03 with surface modification attains a remarkable efficiency of 23.66% and the PSC based on doped WD03 reaches an exceptional efficiency of 25.79%. Following the substitution of trithienylethylene with triphenylethylene, the WD03&#8208;based cell exhibits enhanced stability compared to the cell based on WD04. This work emphasizes the significance of molecular engineering of HTMs in regulating energy level and passivation ability, which are crucial for achieving high Voc and stability in PSCs.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven CO2 and H2O Conversion Over a High&#8208;Density Nickel Single&#8208;Site Catalyst With Unprecedented CO Evolution Rate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;density single&#8208;site Ni catalyst enables carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction in pure water (H2O) under full&#8208;spectrum irradiation, delivering an outstanding CO production rate. The catalyst effectively integrates UV&#8208;visible light&#8208;driven photoexcitation with infrared&#8208;induced photothermal effects, which together promote electron transfer and proton migration, thereby efficiently enhancing the CO2 reduction process.








ABSTRACT
Achieving carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction with water (H2O) on photothermal catalysts remains a major challenge. Here, we report a high&#8208;density Ni single&#8208;site catalyst based on a porous aromatic framework (PAF), which enables efficient CO2 reduction in pure H2O under full&#8208;spectrum illumination without the need for additives. Ni&#8208;PAF achieves CO production rates of 25.64 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 under Xe light and 229.04 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 under concentrated sunlight, exceeding all reported results. Nitrogen&#8208;rich groups anchor Ni single sites uniformly, serving as the active centers for the activation of CO2 and H2O. Calculations and experiments show that UV&#8211;Vis light drives charge transfer, while IR absorption induces a localized temperature rise. Besides, the low thermal conductivity of PAF confines this heat, creating a thermal microenvironment that enhances charge migration and proton transfer, thereby accelerating CO2 conversion. These synergistic effects make Ni&#8208;PAF a highly promising catalyst for solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction in H2O and offer new opportunities for designing efficient photothermal catalysts toward solar fuel production.

         <title>Heterojunction Membranes With Enhanced Built&#8208;in Electric Field for Sustainable Fluidic Electro&#8208;Fenton Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeOCl@rGO electrocatalytic membranes with a heterojunction&#8208;mediated built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) enable synergistic regulation of local charge redistribution and interfacial charge transfer, which simultaneously accelerates 2e&#8722; ORR&#8208;derived H2O2 generation and the Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox cycling through optimizing Fe d&#8208;band center and *OOH adsorption energy, achieving highly efficient electro&#8208;Fenton catalysis.








ABSTRACT
The sluggish interfacial electron transfer at the cathode significantly limits the efficiency of in situ H2O2 electrosynthesis and the Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox cycle in electro&#8208;Fenton (EF). Herein, heterojunction FeOCl@rGO electrocatalytic membranes (EMs) with an enhanced built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) were rationally designed employing an interface engineering approach. The BIEF optimizes the adsorption configuration of O2/H2O2 and the d&#8208;band center of Fe sites by instigating local charge redistribution and establishing a directional potential gradient at the heterointerface, which significantly promotes the on&#8208;site synthesis of H2O2 and the continuous regeneration of Fe(II). The BIEF&#8208;enhanced EMs exhibit excellent EF performance across a wide pH range and in various natural water matrices, enabling rapid degradation of diverse organic pollutants with extremely low energy consumption (0.395&#160;kWh m&#8722;3 order&#8722;1). Under continuous filtration operation, the pollutant removal efficiency approaches 100% at a unit cost of 0.0035 USD/liter. This heterojunction&#8208;regulated BIEF strategy provides an important tool for regulating interfacial charge dynamics and H2O2 activation in EF, showcasing great potential in energy&#8208;efficient water purification.

         <title>Recyclable, Highly Thermally Stable and Intrinsically Flame Retardant Bio&#8208;Based Polybenzoxazine Vitrimers Enabled by Dual Dynamic Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual dynamic covalent network was successfully constructed via rational molecular design based on versatile benzoxazine chemistry, incorporating both imine and silyl ether bonds as exchangeable cross&#8208;links. The resulting bio&#8208;polybenzoxazine vitrimers demonstrate tunable thermal stability achieved through selective incorporation of bio&#8208;derived diamines, exceptional flame retardancy evidenced by rapid self&#8208;extinguishing characteristics, and an optimal balance between thermal robustness and controlled degradability.








ABSTRACT
Vitrimers represent an emerging class of polymeric materials that combine mechanical robustness and dimensional stability while still maintaining reprocessability and degradability. Despite considerable advances in studies of vitrimers, there remains a pressing demand for developing robust dynamic covalent chemistries that enable the vitrimers with high thermal stability and intrinsic flame retardancy. In this work, we design a dual dynamic covalent network in benzoxazines using bio&#8208;based precursors derived from vanillin and sustainable diamines, in which imine bonds and silyl ether bonds are strategically incorporated to break through the trade&#8208;off between degradability and high performance. Notably, the newly obtained polybenzoxazine vitrimers exhibit outstanding thermal stability (with a 10% weight loss temperature of 361.7&#176;C and char yield of 61.4%), exceptional flame retardancy (V&#8208;0 ranking), and undergo complete degradation within 6 h under alkaline conditions. This study broadens the range of sustainable vitrimers and establishes a new design paradigm for reconciling the traditionally competing properties of recyclability, thermal robustness, and fire safety in thermosetting materials.

         <title>Lysine Targeting Group&#8208;Transfer Chimeras for Proximity Induction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report group&#8208;transfer chimeras (GRC) that employ a transferase&#8208;type reactivity to append any moiety&#8208;of&#8208;interest onto the lysine of the target protein by developing a miniature and hydrolytically stable group&#8208;transfer handle SuFA. GRCs induced proximity between cancer cells and cytotoxic T cells, triggering the latter's activation.








Abstract
Nature employs post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) to induce proximity between proteins by engendering new interactions. Furthermore, we find that protein ligands are invariably proximal to a lysine. Inspired by these two observations, we developed group&#8208;transfer chimeras (GRCs) that append a moiety&#8208;of&#8208;interest to the lysine side chain. GRCs employ a protein's ligand and a handle with a transferase&#8208;type reactivity to modify the proximal lysine. Contemporary lysine&#8208;targeting group&#8208;transfer handles were incompatible with GRCs due to their hydrolytic instability, large size, high reactivity, and synthetic incompatibility with diverse ligands. Accordingly, we developed an N&#8208;(sulfonyl)&#8208;N&#8208;(trifluoroethyl)&#8208;ethanamide (SuFA) handle that is stable, small, and exhibits tunable reactivity and synthetic compatibility with diverse ligands and proteins. Using GRCs that group&#8208;transfer binders of tags (e.g., HaloTag, FKBP) onto proteins overexpressed in cancer cells, we displayed these binders on the surface of the cancer cell. With a universal T cell engager (UniTE) that binds to the displayed ligands and T cells, these GRCs induced proximity between cancer cells and cytotoxic T cells, leading to the latter's activation. We envision the GRC platform to find utility in basic research and biomedicine.

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic Propane Dehydrogenation via Electronic Structure Modulation of Platinum Sites Over Platinum&#8208;Based Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance photocatalytic propylene yield via propane dehydrogenation, Pb was selected as the optimum second metal to modulate Pt/ZnO, resulting in weakened adsorption of propylene over PtPb alloys. Therefore, the propylene&#8208;occupied Pt sites can be quickly freed to converse the unreacted propane and PtPb/ZnO exhibited a greatly improved propylene yield of 5.4&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 compared with Pt/ZnO or the other PtM/ZnO catalysts (1&#8764;1.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1).








ABSTRACT
Photocatalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) offers a promising route for propylene production under mild conditions despite the unsatisfactory propylene yield at present. Herein, we have introduced several second metals into Pt/ZnO catalyst to modulate the electronic structure of Pt by forming PtM alloys. Among all these catalysts, PtPb alloys/ZnO catalyst (PtPb/ZnO) exhibits the optimum photocatalytic PDH activity. Both experiments and density functional theory calculations reveals that PtPb alloys significantly increases the electron density of Pt, weakening the interaction between Pt and propylene. This facilitates the desorption of the produced propylene during photocatalytic PDH, thus helping to release Pt active sites for reactant conversion. A 3.6&#8208;fold increase on propylene yield of photocatalytic PDH has been achieved over PtPb/ZnO with a propylene production rate of 5.4&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Our findings highlight the critical relationship between the electronic structure of Pt active sites and performance, marking product desorption modulation an effective strategy to boost photocatalytic PDH.

         <title>Orientation Site&#8208;Induced Antiferromagnetic Coupling Stabilizes Reconstructed Cathode From Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orientation&#8208;site&#8211;guided Nb incorporation during direct regeneration of spent cathode induces strong antiferromagnetic coupling between Ni and O, transforming &#960;&#8208;dominated to &#963;&#8208;dominated interactions and suppressing Ni migration, thereby enabling highly durable regenerated layered cathodes for sustainable lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.








ABSTRACT
Direct regeneration of spent layered ternary oxide cathodes offers a sustainable pathway for resource recovery and circular battery manufacturing. However, their long&#8208;term stability is fundamentally constrained by intrinsic electronic interactions. In particular, the inherent &#960;&#8208;type hybridization between Ni 3d orbitals and O 2p orbitals facilitates detrimental Ni migration and rock&#8208;salt phase formation, ultimately leading to rapid capacity degradation. Here, we leverage the preexisting Li vacancies in spent LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) as orientation sites to induce localized lattice stress fields during regeneration. The resulting lattice perturbation modulates the spin configuration of bridging O anions, thereby triggering antiferromagnetic coupling between adjacent Ni cations and O anions. Consequently, the Ni&#9472;O orbital hybridization transitions from weak &#960;&#8208;dominated to robust &#963;&#8208;dominated interactions, as evidenced by enhanced covalent character of the Ni&#9472;O bonds. This reinforced bonding framework effectively suppresses Ni migration and defect propagation during repeated lithiation/delithiation cycles. As a result, the regenerated NCM cathode exhibits significantly improved durability, retaining &#8764;60% of its initial capacity after 750 cycles. These findings reveal a direct correlation between the local valence bond evolution and cycling reversibility of cathode materials, offering new design principles and mechanistic insights for stabilizing regenerated cathode materials.

However, their long-term stability is fundamentally constrained by intrinsic electronic interactions. In particular, the inherent &#960;-type hybridization between Ni 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; orbitals and O 2&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbitals facilitates detrimental Ni migration and rock-salt phase formation, ultimately leading to rapid capacity degradation. Here, we leverage the preexisting Li vacancies in spent LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM) as orientation sites to induce localized lattice stress fields during regeneration. The resulting lattice perturbation modulates the spin configuration of bridging O anions, thereby triggering antiferromagnetic coupling between adjacent Ni cations and O anions. Consequently, the Ni&#9472;O orbital hybridization transitions from weak &#960;-dominated to robust &#963;-dominated interactions, as evidenced by enhanced covalent character of the Ni&#9472;O bonds. This reinforced bonding framework effectively suppresses Ni migration and defect propagation during repeated lithiation/delithiation cycles. As a result, the regenerated NCM cathode exhibits significantly improved durability, retaining &#8764;60% of its initial capacity after 750 cycles. These findings reveal a direct correlation between the local valence bond evolution and cycling reversibility of cathode materials, offering new design principles and mechanistic insights for stabilizing regenerated cathode materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Kaitocephalin: A Neuroprotective Natural Product Featuring a Peptide&#8208;Like yet Nonpeptidic Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kaitocephalin (KCP) is a neuroprotective fungal metabolite with a unique scaffold of amino acids linked via C&#8211;C bonds. Genome&#8208;transcriptome analyses identified its biosynthetic gene cluster (kpb cluster) in Eupenicillium shearii. LC&#8208;MS/MS profiling identified four new KCP&#8208;related compounds. In vitro assays using 2(S)&#8208;dechlorokaito lactate, one of the four metabolites as a substrate revealed the functions of KpbI, KpbM, and KpbB, showing that KpbI catalyzes an unprecedented two&#8208;step oxidation.








ABSTRACT
Kaitocephalin (KCP) is a neuroprotective natural product that acts as an antagonist of ionotropic glutamate receptors, making it a highly promising lead for drug discovery. It possesses a unique scaffold composed of three amino acids connected via C&#9472;C bonds, which appears peptide&#8208;like but is formed without peptide bonds. In this study, we identified the KCP biosynthetic gene cluster (kpb cluster) in the producing fungus Eupenicillium shearii through integrated genomic and transcriptomic analyses. LC&#8208;MS/MS profiling and chemical derivatization of E. shearii extracts led to the discovery of four novel pathway&#8208;related metabolites. In vitro enzymatic assays with 2(S)&#8208;dechlorokaito lactate, one of the four identified metabolites, as a substrate enabled functional characterization of KpbI, KpbM, and KpbB involved in KCP formation. Among them, the dioxygenase KpbI was found to catalyze an unprecedented two&#8208;step oxidation to form the d&#8208;serine moiety. In addition, isotope tracing experiments provided new insights into the origin of the l&#8208;proline moiety. These findings establish a foundation for future studies aimed at elucidating the complete biosynthetic mechanism of KCP.

The assembly of a bola&#8208;type porphyrin&#8208;perylenebisimide (PBI) supra&#8208;amphiphile via a shielded hydrogen&#8208;bond motif was demonstrated in water. Stabilization of the motif was achieved through the formation of a hydrophobic pocket within the self&#8208;assembled spherical superstructures of the entire supra&#8208;amphiphile. The aggregates exhibit multi&#8208;directional charge&#8208;transfer interactions from the porphyrin to the PBI, as well as within the PBI stacks, depending on which chromophore is excited.

         <dc:description>
Multiple&#8208;resonance emitters designed with peripherally fused five&#8208;member aromatic ring contained heavy&#8208;atom fragments simultaneously achieves high reverse intersystem crossing rate (&#8805;106 s&#8722;1) and small full width at half maximums of 25&#160;nm. The organic light&#8208;emitting diodes device achieves 31.3% external quantum efficiency with low efficiency roll&#8208;off and pure green emission.








ABSTRACT
Multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters featuring rapid reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) are highly desirable for efficient triplet harvesting. &#160;Conventional heavy&#8208;atom strategies often enhance RISC at the expense of spectral broadening, particularly when heavy atoms are embedded in 8&#960;&#8208;electron six&#8208;membered rings, where aromaticity reversal between H&#252;ckel's and Baird's rules induces structural reorganization. Here, we report a design strategy through peripheral fusion of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;containing five&#8208;membered aromatic rings into a classical multiple&#8208;resonance framework BCzBN. The rigid aromatic 6&#960;&#8208;electron rings maintain planarity in both ground and excited states for small reorganization energy, which effectively suppresses structural relaxation&#8208;induced spectral broadening, while simultaneously enhancing spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC). The resulting emitters achieve narrowband pure&#8208;green electroluminescence with a 27&#160;nm full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) and Commission Internationale de l&#8242;&#201;clairage y&#8208;coordinate of 0.72, together with a RISC rate &gt;106 s&#8722;1. Optimized organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices show a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 31.3% with negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off, maintaining EQEs of 31.2% and 25.6% at 1000 and 10&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, respectively. This work demonstrates the critical role of &#960;&#8208;electron counting in heavy&#8208;atom integration and provides a general design principle for high&#8208;performance MR&#8208;TADF materials that concurrently achieve narrow emission and fast RISC kinetics.

         <dc:description>
The &#8220;gear&#8208;and&#8208;conveyor&#8221; design of the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction embodies its dual synergy: interlocked gears enable internal charge steering, while an S&#8208;shaped conveyor belt drives the external cascade reaction of intermediates on oxidative ZIS and reductive T4&#8208;CdCu modules. As reported by Shang&#8208;Fu Yuan, Bingzhe Wang, Tao Wu, and co&#8208;workers (e518681), this system achieves a record&#8208;breaking photocatalytic cascade from benzylamine to dibenzylamine with complete selectivity under light.

         <title>Traces of Elements in the Electrochemical Reductive Amination of Acetone: Uncovering Bi as Substitute for Pb</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the impact of various p&#8208;block element impurities in the electrochemical reductive amination and reveals with Bi a less toxic alternative for Pb. The utilization of Bi as additive was further optimized by studying the impact of additive concentration, reaction temperature, and cathode material on amine yield, offering new possibilities to synthesize pharmaceuticals sustainably. 








ABSTRACT
Amines are broadly utilized as solvents, pharmaceuticals, herbicides, or materials. A benign synthesis route to produce amines from carbonylic substrates is the electrochemical reductive amination, whereby electrons combined with a green proton source like water serve as formal reducing agent. Surprisingly, investigating various p&#8208;block elements as mediator for the electrochemical conversion of acetone in presence of methylamine revealed that only elements of the sixth period show an activity. Building up on these findings and the general low toxicity of Bi compared to Tl or Pb, the electrochemical hydrogenation of N&#8208;methylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;imine was optimized by studying the effect of Bi concentration, reaction temperature, and cathode material. Thus, this work highlights Bi as innovative mediator for the electrochemical reductive amination, whereby in presence of a few ppm&#8208;amounts of Bi at ambient temperatures high amine yields are achievable.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Molecular Cages as Probes in Indicator Displacement Assays: The Case of Scopolamine Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sensing strategy using molecular cages in an indicator displacement assay to detect scopolamine, a drug often implicated in drug&#8208;facilitated sexual assaults. The mechanism relies on the drug&#8208;induced transformation of non&#8208;emissive [Fluorescein2&#8834;Cage] into [Scopolamine&#8834;Catenane], releasing highly emissive free fluorescein. This turn&#8208;on response enables drug detection and quantification via fluorescence spectroscopy.

This image illustrates circularly polarized organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (CP&#8208;OLPL) from polymer films doped with chiral Cu(I) complexes. By embedding enantiomeric Cu(I) complexes, R/S&#8208;NDP&#8208;CuCl, into polymethyl methacrylate, polymer&#8208;based luminescent materials with CP&#8208;OLPL properties are developed. This design enables the formation of charge&#8208;separated states through photoinduced metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer, stabilized in the polar polymer matrix, resulting in CP&#8208;OLPL emissions.

         <title>Switching N&#8208;N Versus N&#8208;H Couplings in Nitrate Electroreduction With CuPd Surface Atomic Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface atomic motifs of CuPd bimetallic nanoparticles have been disclosed to significantly direct the post&#8208;NO pathways in nitrate electroreduction towards either dinitrogen or ammonia, essentially owing to the distinct surface binding strength towards *NO and *N intermediates over Cu&#8208;Pd, Pd&#8208;Pd, and Cu&#8208;Cu motifs.








ABSTRACT
Nitrate electroreduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) offers a promising solution to address excessive nitrate emissions by converting them into either environmentally benign dinitrogen or useful ammonia. Bimetallic catalysts, such as CuPd, have been recognized to be active for NO3&#8722;RR. However, the product discrepancies over bimetallic catalysts hinder further rational construction, largely owing to the poor understanding of how atomic&#8208;level surface structures precisely control post&#8208;NO reduction pathways via crucial intermediates binding. Herein, we take CuPd as model bimetallic catalysts with ordered (o&#8208;CuPd) and phase&#8208;segregated (p&#8208;CuPd) architectures, featuring Cu&#8208;Pd hetero&#8208;motifs and Cu&#8208;Cu/Pd&#8208;Pd homo&#8208;motifs on the surface, respectively, to elucidate the structure&#8208;performance relationship. The o&#8208;CuPd enabled selective N2 production with a current density up to 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;95%, whereas the p&#8208;CuPd achieved NH3 formation with 195&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and &#8764;84% FE. Multiple in situ studies and DFT calculations disclosed that the binding strength of *NO intermediates scales linearly with that of *N, and their adsorption strengths over Cu&#8208;Pd and Cu&#8208;Cu or Pd&#8208;Pd motifs play a crucial role in determining the post&#8208;NO reduction pathways towards either N&#8208;N or N&#8208;H couplings, resulting in distinct final products. This work provides new insights for the rational construction of bimetallic catalysts for denitrification and ammonia electrosynthesis.

A mathematical model was developed to quantify the relationship between depth of discharge (DOD) and cycle life. Guided by this model, a multifunctional additive containing amide and sulfonic acid groups was designed to suppress zinc corrosion, hydrogen evolution, and dendrite growth, as well as to enhance performance in both two&#8208; and four&#8208;electron Zn||I2 batteries.








ABSTRACT
The performance enhancement of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) critically hinges on the intelligent design of electrolyte additives. However, elucidating the complex mechanistic role of additives remains challenging due to intricate multiple interactions at the molecule&#8211;electrode interface and within the ion&#8208;solvent structure, rendering traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches inadequate for precise performance regulation. To address this, we develop a quantitative model that correlates depth of discharge (DOD) and cycle life. Guided by the correlation between different functional groups, a multifunctional additive featuring both amide (&#9472;CONH&#9472;) and sulfonic acid (&#9472;SO3&#8722;) groups was strategically selected. The experimental validation clearly demonstrates that this additive can function through three complementary mechanisms, thereby effectively suppressing the issues of corrosion, hydrogen evolution, and dendrite growth. Consequently, the zinc anode achieves an exceptional cycle reversibility exceeding 5000&#160;h, and Zn||Cu batteries exhibit remarkable stability for 3800 times with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.9%. Notably, this strategy also drastically enhances the cycling stability of both two&#8208;electron and four&#8208;electron Zn||I2 batteries as well as Zn||Br2 batteries. This work offers a generalizable, performance&#8208;driven design framework for multifunctional additives, paving the way toward practical, long&#8208;life zinc&#8208;halogen batteries.

         <title>Constructing Wide&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Range Li&#8211;S Batteries Through Synergistic Boride Spin&#8208;Polarization Coupling Regulation and Magnetohydrodynamic Effects</title>

         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries face polysulfide shuttle, slow kinetics, and dendrite growth, and so on. The magnetic field strategy optimized both electrodes: the spin engineering in FeNi&#9472;B bipyramids boosts Fe3+ catalytic activity via spin transitions, and the coupled electric/magnetic fields enable dendrite&#8208;free Li plating via MHD convection. The assembled battery exhibits excellent stability even at &#8722;40&#176;C through spin&#8208;polarized adsorption and Lorentz&#8208;driven ion transport. 








ABSTRACT
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, despite their high specific capacity, high theoretical energy density, environmental benignity, and low cost&#8208;related unique advantages, face critical challenges including polysulfide shuttling, sluggish redox kinetics, and uncontrolled lithium dendrite growth. Here, we propose a magnetic field cooperative regulation strategy that concurrently optimizes both sulfur cathode and lithium via spin engineering and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects. Bilayer&#8208;hollow FeNi boride bipyramids (FeNi&#9472;B) with nanoreactor architectures were designed, in which an external magnetic field triggers 3d&#8208;orbital electron spin rearrangement. Simultaneously, the uniform distribution of ions and dendrite&#8208;free deposition were achieved by driving lithium&#8208;ion spiral convection through MHD effects. It is worth noting that the optimized cells exhibit exceptional cycling stability under extreme conditions (&#8722;40&#176;C). Density functional theory and multiphysics simulations jointly reveal two mechanisms: Spin&#8208;polarization&#8208;enhanced adsorption energy for sulfur species and lithium protection via Lorentz&#8208;force&#8208;mediated ion transport. This work establishes a novel paradigm for designing magnetic field&#8208;responsive electrocatalysts and manipulating spin&#8208;orbit coupling, offering broad implications for multiphysical&#8208;field strategies in next&#8208;generation batteries.

         <title>Aqua&#8208;Oxidation of Polyethylene Into Carboxylic Acids Under Mild Conditions: A Catalyst&#8208;Free Upcycling Strategy for Nonpolar Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqua&#8208;oxidation upcycles polyethylene wastes into carboxylic acids under mild and catalyst&#8208;free conditions (160&#176;C, H2O, 1&#160;MPa O2). It achieves a high yield of carboxylic acids of 97.8 wt%, for which 72.1% is C4&#8211;C10 diacids. Isotopic in situ ATR&#8208;FTIR studies and microstructural analysis&#160;reveal that the aqua&#8208;oxidation is primarily dominated by O2, while H2O functions as a key medium that facilitates the oxygen&#8208;polyethylene interaction. 








ABSTRACT
Noncatalytic polyolefin upcycling offers distinct advantages in eliminating catalyst costs and enhancing operational stability, yet it remains highly challenging under mild conditions. Herein, we develop an aqua&#8208;oxidation strategy that converts polyethylene into carboxylic acids at 160&#176;C without using any catalysts or organic solvents. The mass yield of carboxylic acid is up to 97.8&#160;wt%, of which 72.1% is comprised by C4&#8211;C10 dicarboxylic acids. The roles of H2O and O2 play in aqua&#8208;oxidation were further investigated in an in situ liquid&#8208;phase spectroscopic reactor filled with isotope&#8208;labeled D2O. It reveals that O2 governs the effective initiation and oxidation of polyethylene. Whereas&#160;H2O serves as a key medium to intensify oxygen&#8211;polyethylene interaction uniformly and inhibit localized oxidation, promoting selective upcycling to narrow&#8208;distributed acids. Moreover, this strategy allows for upcycling diverse commercial polyolefins with additives. This study presents a breakthrough in the noncatalytic upcycling of polyolefins under mild conditions and demonstrates the potential of this eco&#8208;friendly and streamlined strategy for advancing plastic circularity.

         <title>Selective Upcycling of Polycarbonate Waste to Cyclohexanol via RuLa Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxidation&#8208;free short&#8208;flow strategy enables selective transformation of polycarbonate waste into cyclohexanol using a RuLa dual single&#8208;atom catalyst under low&#8208;pressure hydrogenation conditions.








ABSTRACT
Cyclohexanol is a key intermediate for nylon manufacture, yet its industrial synthesis relies on partial oxidation of cyclohexane at &#8764;2&#160;MPa with &lt;5% single&#8208;pass conversion, an energetically wasteful and atom&#8208;inefficient process that demands extensive recycle and generates substantial emissions. Here, we introduce an oxygen&#8208;atom&#8208;efficient synthetic strategy that transforms polycarbonate (PC) waste directly into cyclohexanol through a non&#8208;oxidative catalytic route. The method leverages the intrinsic oxygen functionality of the polymer as a built&#8208;in source of hydroxyl groups, thereby eliminating the conventional oxidation step. A RuLa dual&#8208;atom (RuLa&#8208;DA) catalyst anchored on CoAl oxide enables cooperative hydrogen activation and spillover through moderated Ru&#8211;H binding, driving selective aromatic&#8208;ring hydrogenation under mild gas&#8208;phase conditions. Operating at 0.25&#160;MPa and a 4.2 s residence time, the tandem hydropyrolysis&#8211;hydrogenation process affords a 69.9% yield and 95.4% selectivity for cyclohexanol, maintaining &gt;95% selectivity for post&#8208;consumer PC over 100 feed cycles. Life&#8208;cycle and techno&#8208;economic analyses indicate the potential environmental and economic advantages, showing a 35% cost reduction and a threefold lower carbon footprint relative to the fossil route. This oxygen&#8208;retentive hydrogenation paradigm establishes a general approach for valorizing oxygen&#8208;rich substrates and suggests a conceptually viable pathway toward atom&#8208;economical synthesis and circular chemical manufacturing.

         <title>50 Years of Giese Reaction &#8211; a Personal View</title>

         <dc:description>
The Giese&#8208;Reaction celebrates its 50. Birthday, it is a cyclic radical chain reaction centered around C,C&#8208;bond formation in a three component synthesis. This minireview speaks about the birth of the name&#8208;reaction, explains how the complete understanding of its reaction mechanism stimulates new methods in organic synthesis, and why it can proceed in living cells.








Abstract
50 years ago, a synthetic method was discovered, in which alkyl radical precursors, alkenes and hydrogen donors selectively yield 1:1:1&#8208;addition products in cyclic chain reactions. This paved the way for many variants of three&#8208;component syntheses, which became standard procedures for C,C&#8208;bond formation. For successful syntheses the different chain carrying radicals have to follow reactivity and selectivity rules. This requires knowledge of the substituent influence on substrate&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities of intermolecular radical reactions. These rules were experimentally elucidated, and the synthetic method was coined &#8220;Giese reaction&#8221;. 20 years after its discovery in the chemical laboratory, biologists observed that microorganisms use the same synthetic strategy, which triggered our studies on biological cells. Although chemical rules in laboratory vessels and biological cells are the same, their different set&#8208;ups lead to very different features. Syntheses in homogeneous solution of a laboratory vessel is driven by kinetic effects. In contrast, most reactions in biological cells occur at protein/water interfaces, where thermodynamic interactions with enzymatic amino acids establish close contact between the educts. In addition, biochemical processes often start with metallo&#8208;cofactors that generate the productive radicals at the interface by long&#8208;distance electron transfer.

         <title>Fibril Structure of Desiccation&#8208;Protective Tardigrade Protein CAHS&#8208;8</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the atomic structure of the fibril formed by an intrinsically disordered protein that has been shown to be responsible for remarkable environmental stress in tardigrades. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals a unique mechanism of fibril assembly whereby a single helix forms a stable, antiparallel coiled&#8208;coil dimer, which then assembles into a single continuous fibril via a second coiled&#8208;coil interface on the opposing face of the helix.








Abstract
Cytosolic Abundant Heat&#8208;Soluble (CAHS) proteins are thought to be responsible for protection of tardigrades against conditions of extreme environmental stress, in particular desiccation. Hypsibius exemplaris CAHS&#8208;8 is intrinsically disordered in solution, undergoing conformational transformation as a function of stress, assembling into fibres that form a hydrogel. Here we present the crystal structure of the fibrils of CAHS&#8208;8, comprising a single 101 residue&#8208;long helix, forming an atypical 90 amino&#8208;acid coiled&#8208;coil dimer exhibiting non&#8208;canonical periodicities and assembling into fibrils via a second coiled coil interface associating adjacent dimers via the opposing face of the helix. Combination with electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and disorder modelling provides structural insight into the details of this assembly that is essential for cell survival. Individual fibrils appear to interact in a pairwise manner, possibly via their intrinsically disordered tails, forming straight fibres.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release Diversification of 1&#8208;Azabicyclobutanes via Bromide/Nickel Relay Catalyzed 1,3&#8208;Bis&#8208;Carbofunctionalization</title>

A four&#8208;component synthesis of azetidines with an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center via strain&#8208;release 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;carbofunctionalization of 1&#8208;azabicyclobutanes (ABB) is described. Each reaction component can be modified to permit a high&#8208;throughput&#8208;like library preparation, producing azetidines with various appendages, including biorelevant molecules. The post&#8208;modification of selected products could also generate skeletally distinct azetidines.








Abstract
Despite the high demands for azetidines as privileged motifs in medicinal chemistry, efficient synthesis platforms that enable the rapid preparation of diversely decorated azetidines remain limited. Although the bis&#8208;functionalization of highly strained 1&#8208;azabicyclobutane (ABB) has been one of the most viable, modular, and versatile methods for the synthesis of structurally diverse azetidines, the catalytic installation of aliphatic pendants to ABB remains underexplored. In this work, we report the multicomponent synthesis of the elusive all&#8208;carbon quaternary azetidines from ABBs through the radical addition of azetidines to various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, amides, ketones, a 1,3&#8208;enyne, and a vinylphosphonate ester. The reaction is facilitated by a bromide/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed polar&#8208;radical relay strategy, enabling the radical difunctionalization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds via sequential ring&#8208;strain&#8208;release azetidinylation and Suzuki&#8208;type arylation or alkenylation. Variation in the individual components enabled the synthesis of &gt;60 azetidine derivatives, including modifications of selected biorelevant molecules. The functional group interconversion of representative azetidine derivatives illustrates the method's potential to produce unprecedented spirocyclic azetidine hybrids, which may be useful for exploring uncharted areas of chemical space in drug design. Additionally, a diastereoselective synthesis using Evans&#8217; oxazolidinone enabled the preparation of an enantiopure azetidine, potentially useful as a platform for library preparation of stereochemically diverse azetidines.

         <title>Dynamic Semiconductor Interface for Scalable Photoelectrochemical Synthesis of Chlorine Disinfectants from Natural Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co dynamic equilibrium in CoWOx enables ultrastable active chlorine synthesis of BiVO4 photoanode from seawater. The CoWOx/BiVO4 photoanode achieves exceptional Faradaic efficiency and selectivity over a broad potential range.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical seawater electrolysis for the chloride oxidation reaction (ClOR) suffers from low selectivity against competing reactions and high onset potentials, which severely limits its efficiency for disinfectant production and marine&#8208;based chemical synthesis. Herein, we engineer an amorphous CoWOx layer on BiVO4 photoanodes that enables highly selective active chlorine (AC) production directly from natural seawater. The CoWOx/BiVO4 photoanode delivers a remarkable photocurrent density of 4.78&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.2&#160;VRHE under AM 1.5G illumination, with a record&#8208;low onset potential of 0.38&#160;VRHE. Notably, it maintains&#160;&gt;&#160;95% Faradaic efficiency and selectivity for AC production across a wide potential range of 0.9&#8211;1.8&#160;VRHE, and retains 86.9% selectivity at 0.6&#160;VRHE, overcoming the challenge of achieving efficient ClOR at low potentials. The incorporation of W suppresses the dissolution of Bi and V, while a dynamic Co2+/Co3+ equilibrium ensures operational stability over 150&#160;h. In situ characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that CoWOx accelerates Cl&#8722; oxidation to &#8226;Cl intermediates and steers the reaction pathways toward selective AC formation by thermodynamically favoring key chlorine adsorption configurations. Scaled&#8208;up 25&#160;cm2 photoanodes achieves an AC production rate of 838&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1. The resulting disinfectant exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum bactericidal efficacy, including 99.99% inactivation of E. coli and S. aureus within 24&#160;h. This work establishes a scalable photoelectrode design for the direct, energy&#8208;efficient&#160;and selective production of valuable active chlorine from seawater.

         <title>Growth, Dissolution and Segregation of Genetically Encoded RNA Droplets by Ribozyme Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ribozymes enable sequence&#8208;encoded turnover of RNA droplet material, resulting in transiently active droplets that selectively segregate based on their genotype. This establishes a direct link between genetic information and droplet behavior, marking a step toward programmable, evolvable RNA&#8208;based compartments with life&#8208;like properties.








Abstract
Active droplets, membraneless compartments driven by internal chemical reactions, are compelling models for protocells and synthetic life. A central challenge is to program their dynamic behaviors using heritable genetic information, which would grant them the capacity to evolve. Here, we create transiently active RNA droplets by integrating sites for ribozyme catalysis directly into the sequence of self&#8208;assembling, four&#8208;arm RNA nanostars. To enable perfusion and observe the resulting dynamics over time, we develop a method for trapping individual droplets in hydrogel cages by targeted in situ photopolymerization. This enables us to quantify the sequence&#8208;programmable droplet dissolution and to control the degradation kinetics by choosing between fast (hammerhead) and slow (hairpin) ribozymes. Furthermore, we trigger the segregation of mixed droplet populations via the sequence&#8208;specific cleavage of a chimeric linker RNA. The droplet&#8208;encapsulated DNA templates code for the regrowth of new droplets, establishing the proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for a minimal, genetically encoded cycle of dissolution and regrowth. By directly linking RNA sequence to droplet stability, composition, and life&#8208;cycle dynamics, our work provides a robust platform for engineering evolvable materials and advancing the bottom&#8208;up construction of synthetic&#160;cells.

         <title>Electrochemical Protection of Cyanobacterial Cells from Molecular Oxygen Enables Sustained PhotoH2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosynthetic microorganisms can be used to perform H2 evolution driven by light. However, a crucial limitationlies in the associated generation of molecular oxygen as a by&#8208;product of photosynthesis, which compromises the activity of the biocatalyst performing H2 production, i.e., the hydrogenase. To tackle this challenge, we present an electrochemical O2&#8208;scavenging strategy, allowing efficient O2 removal from immobilized microbial cells.








Abstract
Photosynthetic hydrogen (photoH2) production is appealing for sustainable energy conversion. Oxygenic photosynthesis uses water as the sole electron source and light to lift electrons to a high energy level. The energized electrons are used by the hydrogenase for the catalytic conversion of protons into H2. Photosynthetic microorganisms own all enzymatic equipment for this process, and the feasibility of photoH2 production was demonstrated. However, one of the main limitations is that O2, which is generated as a byproduct of photosynthesis, compromises the activity of most hydrogenases and hinders the wider applicability of this strategy. We tackle this challenge, showing the protection of cyanobacterial cells from metabolically&#8208;generated O2 by the integration of intact cells into a viologen&#8208;modified redox polymer. Electrochemical activation of the redox polymer allows O2 removal in proximity to the cyanobacterial cells with a steep diffusional gradient of O2 outside the cells. Microelectrochemical local analysis of O2 and H2 confirms the protection and the possibility of photoH2 production. Moreover, the use of mutant cells integrating a photosystem I&#8208;hydrogenase fusion enables sustained photosynthetic H2 production under these conditions, with the electrons for prolonged photoH2 production most likely originating from photosynthetic water splitting.

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Electricity and Light for Efficient Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Recycling of Polystyrene Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic interplay of electricity, light and earth&#8208;abundant, nontoxic iron catalysis allowed for the efficient recycling of post&#8208;consumer polymers into value&#8208;added products. This robust depolymerization strategy was viable on multigram&#8208;scale, where the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction presents an attractive opportunity for a green hydrogen production.








Abstract
Due to their intensive use in every aspect of our everyday life, plastics are accumulating in the environment, hence representing a major societal challenge. The accumulation of plastic waste in the oceans is expected to reach 40 billion tons by 2050. Thus, efficient methods for chemical plastic waste recycling continue to be in high demand toward a future circular economy. Herein, we report a powerful and user&#8208;friendly strategy merging inexpensive and earth&#8208;abundant iron catalysis, light irradiation and electricity to recycle polystyrene and styrene&#8208;containing copolymers into value&#8208;added benzoyl products with up to 73% yield. The robustness of this approach using iron&#8208;electrocatalysis under light irradiation was further demonstrated using postconsumer waste, also viable on multigram scale. Cathodic formation of molecular hydrogen through the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) offers an outstanding potential for a decentralized green hydrogen economy through a societally useful anodic oxidative transformation.

         <title>Halide Bond Assisted Double Desymmetrization of Meso&#8208;Dicarboxylic Acids with Symmetrical Olefins via Asymmetric Halogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a double desymmetrization of meso&#8208;dicarboxylic acids with symmetrical olefins, constructing complex chiral lactones with six stereocenters in one step. Unexpectedly, the halide bond was found to be crucial in achieving high stereoselectivity. This method enables the formal synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;longifolene and provides a versatile platform for accessing valuable terpenoid and norbornane&#8208;based natural products.








Abstract
The efficient synthesis of complex chiral molecules from achiral precursors is essential for sustainable pharmaceutical development. Among available strategies, the desymmetrization of meso compounds provides a powerful route to construct multiple stereocenters in a single step. Although meso&#8208;dicarboxylic acids are promising feedstocks, their catalytic asymmetric desymmetrization remains a significant challenge. Herein we report a catalytic asymmetric halolactonization of meso&#8208;dicarboxylic acids with electronically unbiased olefins, achieving simultaneous desymmetrization of both the meso&#8208;dicarboxylic acid and haliranium intermediate. This method efficiently constructs chiral caged polycyclic lactones bearing six stereocenters in a single operation. Furthermore, the reaction is extended to exocyclic olefins, granting access to valuable terpenoid scaffolds. Its synthetic utility is highlighted by the enantioselective formal synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;longifolene, establishing a versatile platform for accessing norbornane&#8208;based natural products. Mechanistic studies reveal that the brominated amino&#8208;urea catalyst operates as a biomimetic hydrogen&#8208;bonding activator. Unexpectedly, the bromine substituent on the catalysts functions as an unconventional Br&#248;nsted base to stabilize a key intermediate via halide bond instead of a typical halogen bond. This work marks a substantial advancement in terpenoid synthesis, merging operational simplicity with the efficient generation of multiple stereocenters in a single transformation.

         <title>Accelerated O&#9472;O Bond Cleavage and Stabilized Fe Sites by Synergistic d&#9472;p Fe&#9472;Sn Dual&#8208;Atom Pair for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we constructed dual&#8208;atom pair sites consisting of d&#8208;block iron (Fe) and p&#8208;block tin (Sn) anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon (FeSnNC), achieving remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and durability. Mechanistic studies reveal that Sn not only accelerates direct O&#9472;O bond cleavage via a dissociative pathway but also redirects the*OH desorption and stabilizes Fe centers.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed FeNC materials have emerged as the promising catalysts for replacing precious Pt&#8208;based catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, their widespread application remains limited by sluggish kinetics and the long&#8208;term stability of the isolated Fe single&#8208;atom sites. Herein, we report a highly active and durable catalyst (FeSnNC) featuring d&#8208;block iron and p&#8208;block&#8208;metal tin dual&#8208;atom pair sites. In situ infrared spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, together with ab initio molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Fe&#9472;Sn dual&#8208;atom pair sites enable the bridge absorption of O2 and facilitate direct O&#9472;O bond cleavage. The redirection of *OH desorption to the Sn site alleviates Fe&#8208;site degradation, while Sn incorporation can also reinforce the Fe&#9472;N bond, jointly enhancing ORR activity and durability. Under alkaline conditions, the catalyst delivers a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#160;V and a kinetic current density of 69&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.85&#160;V, with negligible performance loss after 10,000 cycles. When applied in a zinc&#8211;air battery, FeSnNC exhibits a peak power density of 262&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and a cycling lifetime exceeding 1,100 hours at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates the great potential of d&#8211;p metal atomic pair sites in ORR catalysis and provides new insights into the rational design of atomically precise metal catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, we constructed dual-atom pair sites consisting of d-block iron (Fe) and p-block tin (Sn) anchored on nitrogen-doped porous carbon (FeSnNC), achieving remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and durability. Mechanistic studies reveal that Sn not only accelerates direct O&#9472;O bond cleavage via a dissociative pathway but also redirects the*OH desorption and stabilizes Fe centers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically dispersed FeNC materials have emerged as the promising catalysts for replacing precious Pt-based catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, their widespread application remains limited by sluggish kinetics and the long-term stability of the isolated Fe single-atom sites. Herein, we report a highly active and durable catalyst (FeSnNC) featuring d-block iron and p-block-metal tin dual-atom pair sites. In situ infrared spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, together with ab initio molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Fe&#9472;Sn dual-atom pair sites enable the bridge absorption of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and facilitate direct O&#9472;O bond cleavage. The redirection of *OH desorption to the Sn site alleviates Fe-site degradation, while Sn incorporation can also reinforce the Fe&#9472;N bond, jointly enhancing ORR activity and durability. Under alkaline conditions, the catalyst delivers a half-wave potential of 0.91&#160;V and a kinetic current density of 69&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.85&#160;V, with negligible performance loss after 10,000 cycles. When applied in a zinc&#8211;air battery, FeSnNC exhibits a peak power density of 262&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a cycling lifetime exceeding 1,100 hours at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work demonstrates the great potential of d&#8211;p metal atomic pair sites in ORR catalysis and provides new insights into the rational design of atomically precise metal catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Radical Copolymerization of Hydrofluoroolefin 2,3,3,3&#8208;Tetrafluroropropene (R1234yf) via Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled radical copolymerization of hydrofluoroolefin (R1234yf) was established via oxidative quenching by developing thermally activated delayed fluorescence catalysts, enabling on&#8208;demand structural regulation with various functional comonomers (vinyl esters/amides) at ppm&#8208;level catalyst loading. Obtained copolymers presented outstanding behavior as superhydrophobic coatings on diverse surfaces and surfactants in emulsion polymerization. 








Abstract
The transformation of hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) into value&#8208;added materials represents an important strategy for sustainable fluorocarbon utilization. Here, we designed a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) photocatalyst based on 3,5&#8208;difluorobenzonitrile core, which has presented high reduction potential (&#8722;1.86&#160;V versus SCE), prolonged lifetime (&#964;TADF&#160;=&#160;31.02 &#181;s) and high quantum yield after excitation. The TADF catalyst facilitated oxidative quenching with a xanthate chain&#8208;transfer agent, enabling visible&#8208;light controlled radical copolymerization of 2,3,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropene (R1234yf) at ppm levels of catalyst usage under ambient conditions. The copolymerization furnished good control across various unconjugated comonomers (vinyl esters, vinyl amides), yielding HFO&#8208;embedded chains with tunable molecular weights, controlled dispersities and good chain&#8208;end fidelity. Furthermore, this versatile synthetic approach promoted on&#8208;demand construction of complex block architectures through chain&#8208;extension polymerization. After hydrolysis, the obtained amphiphilic chains exhibited outstanding performance as superhydrophobic coatings on diverse substrates, and surfactants in emulsion polymerization, supporting practical potentials of HFO&#8208;based copolymers. This work establishes a versatile platform to access well&#8208;defined R1234yf copolymers, creating opportunities to address both HFO&#8208;transformation concern and growing demand for high&#8208;performance fluoropolymers.

         <title>Harnessing RAFT Polymerization for Hierarchical Structuring of Thermosets by Direct Ink Writing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a solvent&#8208;free strategy for direct ink writing of hierarchically structured thermosets by harnessing RAFT polymerization throughout material fabrication. RAFT&#8208;synthesized amphiphilic block copolymers self&#8208;assemble in a selective diacrylate crosslinking diluent to form shear&#8208;thinning inks and undergo end&#8208;group reactivation during photocuring, enabling covalent nanodomain anchoring, nanostructure retention, and high&#8208;fidelity printing of complex 3D architectures under ambient conditions.








Abstract
Integrating molecular self&#8208;assembly with additive manufacturing has opened new avenues for the direct production of thermosetting polymers with intricate geometries and tailored microstructures. The wide range of available chemical compositions enables diverse applications for the materials, including nanostructured porous materials, solid polymer electrolytes, and inorganic composites. Here, we introduce a novel concept by developing photocurable polymeric inks with precisely controlled nanostructures suitable for direct ink writing (DIW). In particular, amphiphilic block copolymers (BCPs) synthesized via reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) polymerization is combined with a crosslinker that also acts as a selective solvent, yielding inks with stable and well&#8208;ordered nanostructures. Upon photocuring of these inks, the nanostructures were largely preserved, and reinitiation of the RAFT end&#8208;groups during network formation covalently anchored the nanodomains to the matrix, thereby improving nanoscale morphology retention and enhancing mechanical performance. These inks exhibit shear&#8208;thinning behavior with rapid structural recovery after extrusion, enabling high&#8208;fidelity DIW. Our strategy offers a powerful route to precisely fabricating hierarchical thermosetting materials under ambient conditions, requiring no complex processing steps and specialized equipment. This work significantly broadens possibilities for designing advanced thermosetting materials with customizable architecture and enhanced functionalities.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Bridged Dual Catalytic Sites Enable Asymmetric C&#9472;C Coupling for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeN4&#8208;O&#8208;Cu NW catalyst was successfully developed with precisely engineered Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Cu sites, achieving a maximum FEethanol of 57.3% in CO2RR. Combined 13CO2&#160;+&#160;12CO co&#8208;feed experiments and a collection of operando/in&#8208;situ characterizations reveal that the enhanced ethanol selectivity originates from asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling between *CO (generated at in&#8208;situ formed LS Fe(II) sites) and *CHO (formed at O&#8208;bridged Cu sites).








Abstract
Understanding C&#9472;C coupling pathways is essential for achieving selective CO2 conversion into multi&#8208;carbon products. However, controlling intermediates dimerization remains highly challenging due to both the complexity of the catalytic systems and the limited mechanistic knowledge into the C&#9472;C coupling process. In this work, a model dual&#8208;site catalyst with precisely configured Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Cu sites is designed by covalently grafting iron&#8208;phthalocyanine (FePc) onto copper nanowires via oxygen bridges (FeN4&#8208;O&#8208;Cu NW), which enables probing of atomic&#8208;level mechanistic insights into the C&#9472;C coupling pathways during electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Remarkably, the FeN4&#8208;O&#8208;Cu NW exhibits a 23.6&#8208;fold enhancement in the ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene Faradaic efficiency ratio as compared to O&#8208;Cu NW, achieving&#160;&gt;&#160;80% C2+ Faradaic efficiency at an industrially relevant current density of 1&#160;A cm&#8722;2. 13CO2/12CO co&#8208;feed experiments together with a collection of operando/in&#8208;situ characterizations reveal that the enhanced ethanol selectivity over FeN4&#8208;O&#8208;Cu NW arises from asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling between *CO and *CHO intermediates, where *CO is generated at the low&#8208;spin single&#8208;Fe&#8208;atom site, while *CHO is produced at the oxygen&#8208;bridged Cu site. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further unveil that the oxygen&#8208;bridged Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Cu site can not only stabilize the in situ generated low&#8208;spin Fe(II) active site for enhancing CO2 activation and lowering *CO desorption energy but also construct an oxygen&#8208;bridged Cu active site to stabilize the *OCHO intermediate, significantly lowering the *OCHO&#8208;to&#8208;*CHO conversion energy barrier, orchestrating an efficient asymmetric *CO&#9472;*CHO coupling path and boosting the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion.

Abstract
Birefringent and nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are crucial for advanced optical applications, yet achieving large birefringence (&#916;n), noncentrosymmetric (NCS) structures, and broad transparency from solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (SUV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions remains challenging. Here, we report a 4HPX family of twelve 4&#8208;hydroxypyridinium halides, constructed from 4&#8208;hydroxypyridinium cations [4HPH]+ and halide anions [X]&#8722; (X&#160;=&#160;F (I, II), Cl (III, VII, X), Br (IV, VIII, XI), I (V, VI, IX, XII)). Solution acidity dictates the structural transformations of this family, from centrosymmetric (I&#8211;IX) to NCS (X&#8211;XII) phases, where C&#9472;O bond lengths act as definitive structural fingerprints. Their optical bandgaps exceed those of all known halogen polyanion&#8208;based crystals due to the large HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps of both [4HPH]+ and [X]&#8722; and can be systematically tuned via hydrogen&#8208;bond strength. The large hyperpolarizability and polarizability anisotropy of [4HPH]+ endow this family with exceptional &#916;n and suitable second&#8211;harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Notably, II [C5H6NO]+(HF2)&#8722; exhibits the largest &#916;n (0.293) within the 4HPX family and among reported water&#8211;free SUV crystals. Meanwhile, I&#8211;V (0.222&#8211;0.293) also outperform commercial birefringent materials. NLO crystals X&#8211;XII show SHG responses. This work provides valuable insights into the rational design of next&#8208;generation birefringent and NLO crystals.

         <title>Discovery of a First&#8208;in&#8208;Class Covalent Allosteric SHP1 Inhibitor with Immunotherapeutic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent allosteric inhibitor M029 was discovered for SHP1, a novel target for immunotherapy. M029 binds to a cryptic Cys remote from the active site, exhibits robust target engagement, and blocks tumor progression by stimulating&#160;antitumor immune response. The study&#160;identifies a ligandable Cys in SHP1, thus expanding the&#160;toolbox of targeted phosphatase drug discovery.








Abstract
Src homology 2 domain&#8208;containing phosphatase 1 (SHP1), encoded by PTPN6, is a key intracellular mediator of inhibitory immune signals. SHP1 is&#160;garnering attention as a potential immunotherapeutic target since SHP1 deletion elicits strong antitumor activity by boosting both innate and adaptive immunity. Unfortunately, no quality SHP1 inhibitor exists to demonstrate its translatability owing to the challenges posed by the chemistry of the phosphatase active site. Herein, we describe the discovery of a first&#8208;in&#8208;class, phenyl chloroacetamide&#8208;based covalent allosteric SHP1 inhibitor M029 through covalent fragment screening and multiparameter optimization. M029 inactivates SHP1 by covalently binding to a non&#8208;conserved and cryptic Cys480 far away from the active site, thus uncovering a novel allosteric mechanism for SHP1 inhibition. In addition, M029 is highly selective for SHP1 and exhibits robust cellular target engagement. Importantly, M029 is orally active and blocks tumor progression in a syngeneic cancer model by activating natural killer cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, along with reduced T cell exhaustion. Together, this study reveals a ligandable Cys that can be exploited for allosteric inhibition of SHP1, which has been refractory to targeted pharmacologic manipulation. The work also demonstrates small&#8208;molecule SHP1 inhibition as a compelling approach for new cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Water&#8208;Processable Covalent&#8208;and&#8208;Supramolecular Polymeric Binders for Silicon/Carbon Anodes with High Interfacial Stability in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
This work presents a water&#8208;processable covalent&#8208;and&#8208;supramolecular polymeric binder that unites poly(acrylic acid), eight&#8208;arm poly(ethylene glycol), and benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 host&#8211;guest interactions into a single adaptive network. Through strong adhesion, reversible stress dissipation, and uniform lithium&#8208;ion transport, the binder enables silicon&#8211;carbon anodes with outstanding interfacial stability and long&#8208;term cycling durability.








Abstract
Silicon/carbon (Si/C) composite anodes are among the most promising candidates for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries but suffer from severe volume fluctuation and interfacial degradation during cycling. Herein, we report a water&#8208;processable covalent&#8208;and&#8208;supramolecular polymeric binders (CSPBs) that synergistically dissipate mechanical stress and promote Li+ transport to stabilize the Si/C anode interface. The CSPBs integrate poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), amine&#8208;terminated eight&#8208;arm poly(ethylene glycol) (8arm&#8208;PEG&#8208;NH2), and benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7/secondary ammonium host&#8211;guest complexes through amidation during electrode fabrication. The covalent linkages impart strong structural integrity, while the reversible supramolecular interactions act as sacrificial bonds to dissipate stress arising from Si volume expansion. Additionally, oxygen&#8208;rich PEG chains form continuous Li+ conduction pathways, enabling efficient ion transport. As a result, the CSPB&#8208;2&#8208;based Si/C anode delivers a high specific capacity of 582.0 mAh g&#8722;1 after 265 cycles at 1C, with superior rate capability than the electrodes based on PAA or solely covalently cross&#8208;linked binders (CCBs). Kinetic analysis reveals an enhanced Li+ diffusion coefficient, confirming the improved ionic conductivity of the binder system. This work demonstrates a new strategy for integrating covalent anchoring and dynamic supramolecular adaptability within a sustainable, water&#8208;processable polymeric binder system, paving the way for the design of durable and high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anodes.

         <title>Facilely Enantiopurified Novel Double Aza[7]Helicenes for Extremely Narrowband Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;resonance (MR)&#8208;active double aza[7]helicene is developed based on all&#8208;nitrogen indolocarbazole scaffolds, showing narrowband pure green emission with a full width at half&#8208;maximum of 18&#160;nm and high electroluminescent performance. Additionally, the enantiopure P,P&#8208; and M,M&#8208;configurations are readily isolated via conventional thin&#8208;layer chromatography, achieving an impressive luminescent dissymmetry factor of&#160;&#177;&#160;3.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance multi&#8208;helicenes are promising for efficient narrowband emission and chiroptical properties, yet systems based predominantly on boron&#8211;nitrogen frameworks often exhibit broadened spectra. Here, we present a brand&#8208;new double aza[7]helicene built on a nitrogen&#8208;containing indolocarbazole scaffold, incorporating four consecutive para&#8208;positioned nitrogen atoms arranged through alternating fusion of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings. This tailored structure enhances the multi&#8208;resonance effect, enabling pure&#8208;green emission with a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 18&#160;nm, a photoluminescence quantum yield of 90%, and a chromaticity y&#8208;coordinate of 0.70, while also stabilizing the double helix configuration. The enantiomers are readily separated using conventional thin&#8208;layer chromatography, avoiding costly chiral columns, and show strong circularly polarized luminescence with dissymmetry factors of 3.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes achieve high&#8208;color&#8208;purity green electroluminescence, with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.2%, maintaining&#160;&gt;&#160;20% at 100,000&#160;cd/m2. This work provides a new paradigm for high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;helicenes with chiral optoelectronics.

         <title>Benzoyl&#8208;Xanthenoxanthenes: Versatile Chromophores for Light&#8208;Engaging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidatively stable benzoyl&#8208;fused peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene ribbons with NIR emission were synthesized. Their good spectral overlap enabled cascaded F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) antennae in a nematic liquid crystal phase, achieving directional energy transfer. The final light&#8208;harvesting system exhibits a two&#8208;step FRET efficiency of 0.70 and extended visible absorption, providing efficient panchromatic light&#8208;harvesting capability.








Abstract
In this work, we present a modular donor&#8211;acceptor strategy that produces oxidatively stable, benzoyl&#8208;fused peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene (PXX) ribbons with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission and light&#8208;harvesting properties. Benzoyl fusion at the pseudo&#8208;peri positions, achieved through intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts planarization, creates the first benzoyl&#8208;functionalized PXX monomers, dimers, and trimers that exhibit deep red&#8211;NIR absorption and emission without significantly raising the HOMO level. The ribbons display strong, tunable absorption and fluorescence bands, with up to 63% of emission in the NIR and an NIR fluorescence quantum yield&#160;reaching 0.36 in solution. Lewis adducts formed between boron&#8208;based Lewis acids and carbonyl acceptor sites further enhance the electron&#8208;accepting nature of the ketones, producing pure NIR emission (&#934;FNIR$\mathit{\Phi}_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{NIR}}$ &#8776; 0.15&#8211;0.16). Spectroelectrochemical investigations uncover reversible electrochromism and electrofluorochromism, allowing&#160;redox&#8208;gated switching and NIR absorption signatures, useful for sensing and display technologies. When embedded in a nematic liquid crystal phase, the ribbons function as cascaded F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) antennas, achieving near&#8208;quantitative single&#8208;step energy transfer (&#934;$\mathit{\Phi}$FRET&#160;=&#160;0.97) and highly efficient two&#8208;step transfer (&#934;$\mathit{\Phi}$FRET&#160;=&#160;0.70), enabling directional energy funneling. Their complementary absorption broadens the excitation window to cover the entire visible spectrum, making them highly efficient panchromatic light&#8208;harvesting materials.

         <title>A&#160;Low&#8208;carbon Space&#8208;Isolated Zinc Hydrolysis for Harvesting Hydrogen and Salts from Seawater and Wastewater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed&#8208;loop process for hydrogen/salt coproduction and waste treatment using seawater/wastewater as a feedstock with electrolytic Zn as the mediator.








Abstract
The direct use of seawater/wastewater for H2 production remains a challenge because impurities in the water compromise electrolyzer stability. Here, we propose a two&#8208;step approach that uses seawater/wastewater for H2 generation, salt recovery, and pollutant degradation. First, Zn hydrolysis occurs at 250&#160;&#176;C in a space&#8208;isolated system, where vapor reacts with solid Zn to generate porous ZnO and H2 at the Zn/vapor interface, achieving up to 99.8% H2 production efficiency. The physical isolation ensures automatic separation of ZnO, salts, and H2 while facilitating in situ hydrogenation that degrades 96.9% of organic phenol, demonstrating pollutant remediation. To close the materials&#8208;loop, the produced ZnO is electrochemically reduced back to Zn with a 99.3% Faradaic efficiency. We validate scalability using a 72 Ah Zn electrolyzer coupled with a 1000&#160;mL reactor, achieving batch production of 2.32&#160;g H2 and 0.92&#160;g seasalt. LCA confirms this combined electrolysis&#8211;hydrolysis approach has fewer carbon emissions and environmental footprints. Beyond H2 production, this system leverages Zn as both an energy carrier to mitigate renewable energy intermittency and a versatile agent for salt recovery and wastewater treatment.

A series of deep&#8208;ultraviolet&#8208;transparent organic sulfonates were designed and synthesized for high&#8208;performing optical nonlinearities, as reported by Chao Wu, Chi Zhang, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e21786). Three key parameters including second&#8208;harmonic generation, bandgap, and birefringence were synchronously optimized in the polar organic sulfonate by employing a connectivity&#8208;regulation approach. The work highlights that structural connectivity change can profoundly influence key nonlinear optical properties.

In the Research Article (e20335), Chenjiang Liu, Yonghong Zhang, and co&#8208;workers successfully achieved a green electrochemical controllable divergent carboxylation of phenylacetylene with carbon dioxide, efficiently affording a variety of value&#8208;added phenylpropiolic acids, cinnamic acids, fumaric acids, and succinic acids under mild condition with good selectivity. This not only provides an efficient strategy for electrochemically driven fixation of wasted greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and high&#8208;value&#8208;added transformation of low&#8208;cost bulk chemicals alkynes, but also convert the clean energy of wind and solar into chemical energy.

In their Research Article (e21118), Xiaohui He, Hongbing Ji, Graham J. Hutchings, and co&#8208;workers report a Pt1Aun/TiO2 catalyst with spatially separate H2 and O2 activation sites for direct synthesis of H2O2. H2 dissociates at Pt single&#8208;atom sites, O2 stabilizes at Au nanoparticle sites, and CH2OH acts as hydrogen carrier to transfer H, which combines with O2 on Au nanoparticles to form H2O2. It achieves &#8764;100% H2O2 selectivity, 128.6 mol&#183;gN.M.&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 productivity, and a &#8764;4 wt.% H2O2 concentration.

         <dc:description>
A confinement&#8208;assisted guided energy transfer (CAGE) system was devised to overcome the limitations in high doping concentration of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters. This system facilitates the efficient redistribution of singlet excitons and suppresses the diffusion of triplet excitons with simple modification of the well&#8208;known MR emitter, resulting in improved device efficiency and operational lifetime. This new approach represents a promising new starting point for the development of blue OLEDs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Discharge Behaviors in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous batteries (ABs) offer unmatched safety and cost&#8208;efficiency for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, yet self&#8208;discharge, a spontaneous energy loss during idle states, compromises their viability. This review decodes self&#8208;discharge mechanisms, standardizes testing protocols, and proposes targeted mitigation strategies. By bridging fundamental insights with practical guidelines, this review attempts to accelerate ABs&#8217; path to commercialization. 








Abstract
Aqueous batteries (ABs) are considered emerging candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their inherent safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and environmental compatibility. In recent years, major advances have been made in ABs toward improving their energy density and cycling stability, and progressing their prospects for real application. However, self&#8208;discharge, a critical parameter for practical applications, remains largely underexplored. Many studies either overlook this aspect entirely or employ inconsistent testing protocols, making cross&#8208;system comparisons difficult and diminishing the reliability of reported data. To date, no comprehensive review that systematically addresses self&#8208;discharge in ABs is available. In this review, we aim to fill this gap by providing an in&#8208;depth analysis of self&#8208;discharge phenomena in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ABs. We first summarize the underlying mechanisms responsible for self&#8208;discharge and then critically evaluate current measurement approaches, offering recommendations for practical and standardized testing protocols. Furthermore, we highlight mitigation strategies from both electrolyte and electrode perspectives, providing a materials&#8208;oriented overview of self&#8208;discharge suppression. This review not only offers a theoretical framework for understanding self&#8208;discharge behaviors in ABs, but also proposes clear guidelines for future experimental assessment, thereby enhancing their practical relevance and accelerating their development toward commercialization.

         <title>Understanding the Entropy Decoupling for Ion Transport in Ordered Biomimetic Materials Toward Durable Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The entropy is decoupled into configurational entropy (Sconf) and excess entropy (Sex) in ordered biomimetic materials, which is expected to promote uniform reaction and high reaction activity simultaneously. The whole ion transport process, from electrolyte phase, interfacial electric double layer to electrode bulk phase, was discussed in detail from the perspective of entropy to enable the highly durable aqueous zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) have emerged as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation grid&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage system, while their development is still challenged by zinc dendrite, gas production, and cathode degradation. Essentially, these issues mainly originate from disordered ion transport behaviors, which is regarded as entropy&#8208;induced side reactions. Entropy is typically decoupled into configurational entropy and excess entropy, which contributes to ionic and electronic distribution, respectively. Uniform ionic distribution with low configurational entropy can alleviate local by&#8208;products, while uneven electronic distribution with high excess entropy will improve reaction activity. However, these both aspects are difficult to be compatible in most cases. As an ideal carrier, the biomimetic materials with specific structure, leveraging the orderliness in morphological structure, molecular arrangement, and charge distribution, exhibit intrinsic advantages in modifying ionic behaviors. This review proposed the significant importance of entropy decoupling dominated by biomimetic materials for regulating ion behaviors. The entire process of ion transport, from electrolyte phase, interfacial electric double layer to electrode bulk phase, was discussed in detail from the perspective of entropy. Furthermore, the mechanism of entropy decoupling for achieving electrodes with both dynamics and stability is systematically analyzed. Finally, we provide outlooks on entropy&#8208;design concepts to enable durable AZMBs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Metal&#8208;Polyphenol Colchicine Nanoparticles Targeting Oxidative Stress and Inflammation for Treatment of Atherosclerosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atherosclerosis is a major cause of mortality, driven by chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. While colchicine shows potential in reducing cardiovascular events, its therapeutic application remains limited and requires further optimization. This study introduces a coordination&#8208;driven, self&#8208;assembled nanoparticle system combining colchicine, tannic acid, and zinc to enhance therapeutic effects of atherosclerosis.








Abstract
Anti&#8208;inflammatory colchicine therapy has emerged as a new era for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. However, the therapeutic benefit of colchicine has not been clearly defined. Herein, we present a double coordination&#8208;driven approach to fabricate a stable metal&#8208;organic nano&#8208;assembly of colchicine (COL&#8208;TA&#8208;Zn) by uniting the tropolone ring of colchicine (COL), phenolic groups of tannic acid (TA), and Zn2+ ions. This design leverages the antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties of COL and TA to create a nanoscale platform capable of scavenging radicals and modulating inflammatory pathways. Through robust Zn2+ coordination, the resulting COL&#8208;TA&#8208;Zn nanocomplexes exhibit enhanced stability under physiological conditions, ensuring efficient delivery and sustained bioactivity. In vitro assays confirm suppression of foam cell formation and multiple inflammatory mediators, suggesting significant potential for managing atherosclerosis by targeting both oxidative stress and inflammation. Intravenous administration of COL&#8208;TA&#8208;Zn in Apoe&#8722;/&#8722; mice significantly reduces atherosclerotic plaque area, MMP&#8208;9, TNF&#8208;&#945;, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, thereby illustrating its superior anti&#8208;atherosclerotic efficacy compared to COL alone. These findings highlight the promise of the dual coordination&#8208;driven nanoplatform in cardiovascular disease treatment.

         <title>Salt Cluster With Surface Defect Shows Anomalous Acid&#8211;Base Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acid displacement of formic acid in sea&#8208;salt aerosols, releasing HCl, challenges conventional acid&#8211;base chemistry. Our gas&#8208;phase experiments show that this reaction occurs on pure NaCl cluster ions in the absence of water. Surface defects of the NaCl cluster ions enable this reaction via enhanced electrostatic interactions of the salt ions with the formate, outweighing the gas&#8208;phase acidity difference between HCl and formic acid.








Abstract
The acid displacement reaction of formic acid in sea&#8208;salt aerosols to release hydrogen chloride is an enigma in atmospheric chemistry: a weak acid transfers a proton to the conjugate base of a strong acid, reversing solution&#8208;phase acid&#8211;base chemistry. To shed light on this question, we compared the reactivity of formic acid with Na13Cl12+ and Na14Cl13+ under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions in a mass spectrometer. No reaction was observed with Na14Cl13+, a known magic cluster that corresponds to a cubic section of the crystal lattice. Na13Cl12+, which corresponds to the cubic section with a surface defect, reacts readily with release of hydrogen chloride and incorporation of formate into the salt structure. Quantum chemical calculations show that the reaction is substantially endothermic for the magic cluster. The surface defect, however, makes it exothermic. The reason lies in the induced fit of the formate ion in the Na13Cl11(HCOO)+ cluster. Its oxygen atoms interact with five sodium ions. In sum, these electrostatic interactions more than offset the 49 &#177; 13&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 difference in gas&#8208;phase acidity between hydrogen chloride and formic acid.

         <title>Alkynyltriazenes in Photochemical Metal&#8208;Free Doyle&#8211;Kirmse Rearrangements</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free photocatalytic Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction of alkynyl triazenes is described, proceeding via cyanocarbene intermediates. This strategy enables the efficient construction of highly substituted asymmetric carbon centers with broad substrate scope, delivering synthetically valuable nitriles.








Abstract
Doyle&#8211;Kirmse rearrangement reactions are widely recognized as versatile and powerful synthetic tools, promoting the simultaneous generation of C&#9472;C and C&#9472;S bonds. While notable progress has been attained, Doyle&#8211;Kirmse rearrangement reactions involving cyanocarbenes have rarely been reported owing to the limited strategies available for the preparation of cyanocarbene precursors and its inherently restricted reactivity. Herein, we report photochemical Doyle&#8211;Kirmse rearrangement reactions of alkynyl triazenes via intermediate cyanocarbenes under metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions, leading to valuable &#945;&#8208;mercapto&#8208;nitriles in generally moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields. In contrast to existing methods that utilize alternative cyanocarbene precurors, this approach delivers the possibility to access highly substituted stereogenic carbon centers and it offers a safer alternative by avoiding hazardous reagents. The reactions proceed under mild conditions, and demonstrate broad substrate compatibility. In addition, upscaling of the reaction was successfully demonstrated. Besides the use of allylsulfides, propargyl as well as allenylsulfides were also feasible substrates demonstrating the great synthetic potential of the transformation.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Based Sonoafterglow Probes for Tumor&#8208;Specific Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sonoafterglow luminophore with a nonconjugated linker is found to emit a stronger sonoafterglow compared to its counterpart with a conjugated linker due to its inhibited rapid electron transfer; this luminophore is further developed into an activatable probe that selectively targets the cancer biomarker, enabling sensitive tumor imaging and efficient sonodynamic therapy.








Abstract
Afterglow imaging uses delayed luminescence to suppress tissue autofluorescence and improve signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios for in vivo diagnostics and therapy. However, because afterglow induction typically requires external light, conventional photoactivated approaches remain suboptimal. Here, we report two hybrid molecular sonoafterglow luminophores that pair tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)3) as a sonosensitizer with a phenoxy&#8208;adamantylidene afterglow substrate: cRuPA and ncRuPA, which are connected via a conjugated alkyne and a nonconjugated amide linker, respectively. After ultrasound treatment, only ncRuPA produces a strong sonoafterglow. In cRuPA, rapid electron transfer across the conjugated alkyne cleaves the dioxetane intermediate before emission can occur, whereas the nonconjugated amide in ncRuPA blocks this transfer, stabilizing the dioxetane and enabling sustained luminescence. ncRuPA is further developed into an activatable probe (ncRuPAAPN) that selectively turns on its sonoafterglow in response to the cancer biomarker aminopeptidase N. ncRuPAAPN enables sensitive tumor imaging and mediates efficient sonodynamic therapy via ultrasound&#8208;triggered singlet oxygen production. These Ru&#8208;based sonoafterglow probes represent the first hybrid sonoafterglow molecules and open new molecular&#8208;design routes toward cancer theranostics.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimulus Triggered Programmable Transformation of Molecular Motor Based Chiral Supramolecular Polymers in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report aldehyde motor&#8211;based chiral supramolecular polymers that exhibit light and chemically driven dual responsiveness in water. The supramolecular polymers show transformation and amplification of multi&#8208;state chirality into diverse geometries, offering dynamic control of supramolecular chirality and architectures.








Abstract
A notable characteristic of living organisms is their capacity to adapt to environmental changes and transform external signals into distinct responsiveness, facilitating the execution of diverse functions with motility as a key parameter. To better mimic such lifelike behavior, researchers have developed various supramolecular assembled systems with responsive behavior toward a variety of stimuli. However, exploiting motion along length scales and achieving collective control over the responsiveness to multiple stimuli in supramolecular systems is still challenging. Here we present the development of molecular motor based supramolecular polymers that are responsive toward multi&#8208;stimulus and exhibit multi&#8208;state assembly and chirality. Taking advantages of aldehyde functionalized motors, we realized photo&#8208;responsive supramolecular polymers featuring boosted photo&#8208;efficiency, near quantitative photoconversions, programmable behavior and responsiveness to multiple stimuli in a reversible manner in aqueous media. The various stimuli including light and different chemicals could act on the motor building blocks and subsequently trigger the transformation of the supramolecular polymers toward reversible polymerization, direct post&#8208;functionalization and chirality modulation. The interplay between the rotary molecular motion and the supramolecular systems assembly process, taking advantage of different external stimuli to govern the assembly state, provides a basis for multi&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials

         <title>Biomimetic NaK Channel Membrane Enabled by a Crown Ether&#8208;Coordinated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial membranes mimicking biological NaK functions are realized by coordinating UiO&#8208;66&#8208;COOH with carboxybenzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5. These membranes exhibit tunable ion selectivity, switching between K+/Mg2+ (102) and Na+/K+ (103) under single&#8208; and mixed&#8208;salt conditions, and enables dynamic Mg2+&#8208;gated ion transport. This work opens new avenues for next&#8208;generation iontronic devices and artificial cells requiring precise and adaptive ion control.








Abstract
Biological NaK channels integrate exquisite ion selectivity with dynamic gating to regulate life processes, yet achieving such multifunctionality in synthetic channels has remained a formidable challenge. Here, we present a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) channel membrane that combines two complementary ion&#8208;conduction motifs: carboxyl groups from UiO&#8208;66&#8208;COOH and carboxybenzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (15C5&#8208;COOH), assembled in a one&#8208;step coordination strategy. This hybrid architecture recapitulates essential NaK channel functions, offering both ultrahigh ion selectivity and controllable gating. The membrane enables highly selective conduction of monovalent cations while effectively excluding Mg2+, yielding M+/Mg2+selectivity above 102. Under mixed&#8208;ion conditions, it achieves unprecedented Na&#8314;/K&#8314; selectivity exceeding 103, far surpassing reported artificial ion channels. Remarkably, Mg2+ ions dynamically gate Na&#8314; and K&#8314; transport with sustainable on&#8211;off ratios around 30. These outstanding performances arise from the synergistic interplay of crown ether and carboxyl groups confined within subnanometer MOF pores. This work establishes a versatile strategy for designing multifunctional artificial ion channels, opening avenues toward advanced ionic devices for artificial cells and biomedical technologies.

&lt;p&gt;Artificial membranes mimicking biological NaK functions are realized by coordinating UiO-66-COOH with carboxybenzo-15-crown-5. These membranes exhibit tunable ion selectivity, switching between K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) under single- and mixed-salt conditions, and enables dynamic Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-gated ion transport. This work opens new avenues for next-generation iontronic devices and artificial cells requiring precise and adaptive ion control.

&lt;p&gt;Biological NaK channels integrate exquisite ion selectivity with dynamic gating to regulate life processes, yet achieving such multifunctionality in synthetic channels has remained a formidable challenge. Here, we present a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) channel membrane that combines two complementary ion-conduction motifs: carboxyl groups from UiO-66-COOH and carboxybenzo-15-crown-5 (15C5-COOH), assembled in a one-step coordination strategy.

In this report, we demonstrate that simple N&#8208;methoxyamide substrates bearing a tethered heteroatom can be used to access oxo&#8208; and aza&#8208;heterocycles of different ring sizes. The catalytic system couples a Cu(I)&#8208;induced radical generation and the subsequent 1,5&#8208;H&#8208;atom transfer together with a Cu(III)&#8208;involved &#947;&#8208;C&#8208;radical trapping by a tethered heteroatom, realizing a redox&#8208;neutral C&#8211;H amination and oxygenation without external oxidants.








Abstract
Cyclative C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization of unactivated C&#9472;H bonds with heteroatoms is a straightforward way to construct saturated aza&#8208; and oxo&#8208;heterocycles, which continues to display ever&#8208;increasing prevalence in drug design. Building upon our recently reported copper catalysis that used simple N&#8208;methoxyamides as radical precursors, we report a method to access diverse aza&#8208; and oxo&#8208;heterocycles, including cyclic sulfonamides, cyclic ethers, and lactones of different ring sizes. By placing a heteroatom in the N&#8208;methoxyamide substrate, the carbon radical formed at the &#947;&#8208;position from the intramolecular H&#8208;abstraction by the amidyl radical could be trapped with the pendant heteroatom, leading to a redox&#8208;neutral Cu&#8208;catalyzed cyclative &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization. The syntheses of a wide range of saturated aza&#8208; and oxo&#8208;heterocycles demonstrate the versatility of this method.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of the Prototypical n&#8208;Type Polymer P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) Enables Capacity Enhancement and High&#8208;Temperature Stability in Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>

Molecular engineering of the prototypical n&#8208;type polymer P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) through side&#8208;chain shortening and donor simplification yields P(NDI2BO&#8208;V) with 1.51&#8208;fold increase in capacity (56.9 &#8594; 86.0 mAh g&#8722;1). Both polymers maintain long&#8208;term cycling stability at 60 &#176;C&#8212;where small&#8208;molecule organic electrodes typically fail&#8212;thereby revealing design rules that link backbone structure to electron transport, Li+ diffusion, and thermal durability.








Abstract
Conjugated n&#8208;type polymers have long been explored as organic cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), yet the widely studied P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) has received limited attention as a practical cathode because of its modest capacity (&#8764;55 mAh g&#8722;1). Here, we report the first systematic effort to re&#8208;engineer this prototypical polymer through side&#8208;chain shortening and donor simplification. Replacing bulky 2&#8208;octyldodecyl (2OD) chains with 2&#8208;butyloctyl (2BO) and simplifying the bithiophene (T2) donor to a vinylene (V) produced P(NDI2BO&#8208;V), which delivers a 1.51&#8208;fold higher capacity (56.9&#8594;86.0 mAh g&#8722;1) while retaining excellent cycling stability. Crucially, we show that n&#8208;type polymers can achieve remarkable cycling stability at elevated temperatures: both polymers remained stable at 60 &#176;C, where small molecules fail, with P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) keeping 97% after 1000 cycles and P(NDI2BO&#8208;V) 80% after 600 cycles. Mechanistic studies combining electrochemical analysis with density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations reveal how donor linker units dictate structure and transport. Crystalline P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) exhibits higher electronic conductivity and undergoes a one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron redox process, whereas amorphous P(NDI2BO&#8208;V) offers enhanced Li+ diffusivity but follows a stepwise pathway. This work establishes a molecular design framework for conjugated polymer cathodes that combine high capacity, efficient charge transport, and long&#8208;term thermal stability, advancing their potential for practical LIB applications.

         <title>Dynamic Confinement Approach for High Metal Loading Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Based on Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduced a new synthetic strategy for the preparation of high metal loading crystalline single&#8208;atom catalysts based on covalent organic frameworks with atomically distributed Pd ions and metal contents of up to 22.2&#160;wt%. Theoretical simulations reveal that the crystalline framework dynamically confines Pd atoms between different binding sites within the pores, ensuring long&#8208;term catalyst stability under practical conditions.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) offer stable, well&#8208;defined active sites by anchoring individual metal atoms on stable organic or inorganic supports, though achieving high metal loadings without clustering or leaching remains a major challenge. Here, we report a synthetic strategy for developing ultra&#8208;high metal loading SACs based on palladium polyphthalocyanine covalent organic frameworks (COFs) synthesized via a mixed metal ionothermal approach, which involves the cyclization of tetracyanobenzene and tetracyanopyrazine as precursors in molten salt mixtures of PdCl2/ZnCl2 or PdCl2/ZnCl2/NaCl. This approach effectively combines the formation of crystalline polymeric hosts with metal impregnation in a single step, yielding COFs with atomically distributed Pd ions and metal contents of up to 22.2&#160;wt%. Theoretical simulations reveal that the crystalline framework dynamically confines Pd atoms between different binding sites within the pores, preventing dimerization and ensuring long&#8208;term catalyst stability. The synthesized catalysts were evaluated under continuous flow conditions, exhibiting stable performance with yields as high as 90% and maintaining stability over a 24&#160;h time&#8208;on&#8208;stream under low&#8208;conversion conditions. These results establish a new benchmark for SACs and underscore the importance of dynamic confinement approach in achieving high metal loadings on crystalline organic supports.

A Cu&#8211;O&#8211;C catalyst derived from oxocarbon precursors exhibits highly dispersed Cu single atoms and delivers faster glycerol oxidation kinetics and higher formate selectivity than conventional Cu&#8208;based and Cu&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts.








Abstract
N&#8208;doped carbon single&#8208;atom catalysts (M&#8211;N&#8211;C) have emerged as some of the most efficient electrocatalysts, offering both high activity and selectivity. To date, stabilization of single atoms on conductive carbon has been achieved almost exclusively through coordination with nitrogen atoms. Here, we introduce copper single&#8208;atom catalysts (Cu SACs) uniquely coordinated by oxygen within a stable oxocarbon network derived from tetrahydroxyquinone (THQ)&#8208;Cu metal&#8208;organic frameworks. By thermal condensation with MgCl2&#183;6H2O at 600 &#176;C, we achieve an oxygen&#8208;rich carbonaceous material (30 wt% O) hosting highly dispersed Cu atoms. Advanced electron microscopic, spectroscopic, and scattering techniques, including high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR&#8208;STEM), X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), pair distribution functions (PDF), and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), provide definitive experimental evidence of predominant Cu&#8211;O coordination, distinguishing these catalysts (M&#8211;O&#8211;C) from conventional nitrogen&#8208;coordinated SACs. The resulting Cu&#8211;O&#8211;C catalyst exhibits high selectivity (85% Faradaic efficiency) for electrochemical glycerol oxidation into formic acid under alkaline conditions, outperforming traditional Cu&#8208;based systems. In comparison with traditional Cu&#8211;N&#8211;C system, Cu&#8211;O&#8211;C shows faster reactions kinetic, arising from unique Lewis basicity of oxygen coordination, facilitating electron&#8208;proton transfer reactions. This study not only pioneers Cu&#8211;O&#8211;C SACs but also introduces oxocarbons as promising supports, offering novel pathways for designing highly efficient single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts.

         <title>Light&#8208; and Heat&#8208;Induced Reversal of Circularly Polarized Luminescence in a Single Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;driven molecular motor coupled to two perylenediimide fluorophores enables reversible control of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Upon irradiation and/or heating, the system switches its CPL signal from off to on and even inverts its handedness. This unprecedented molecular&#8208;level control links nanoscale motion with light&#8208;responsive chiral emission, opening avenues for smart optoelectronic materials.








Abstract
Switching the handedness of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) at the molecular level remains a challenge in the development of responsive chiral materials. We report a light&#8208;driven molecular motor covalently linked to two perylenediimide (PDI) chromophores, enabling reversible and directional modulation of CPL. The different motor states, which are accessible in a unidirectional fashion via light&#8208;irradiation and thermal helix inversion steps, respectively, display significantly distinct chiroptical properties. In addition, our system allows switching of the chiral induction process and hence, the observation of a CPL signal. The present work discloses the first example of reversible CPL sign inversion triggered by light irradiation at the single molecular level, offering a new starting point for designing emitters with light&#8208;responsive chirality modulation.

         <title>Geometry Controls Confined Water Dynamics in Lipidic Mesophases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An archaeal&#8208;inspired lipidic mesophase allows precise control of interfacial curvature and water&#8208;channel connectivity. Combining structural, thermodynamic, and ultrafast spectroscopies, we reveal that curvature governs the structure and reorientation dynamics of confined water, establishing a molecular&#8208;level link between topology and dynamics in soft nanoconfinement.








Abstract
Water under nanoscale confinement is central to biological function, catalysis, and soft materials, yet how geometry dictates its structure and dynamics remains unresolved. Here, we establish a direct link between interfacial curvature and confined water behavior using an archaeal&#8208;inspired phytantriol&#8208;water lipidic mesophase platform. By systematically tuning curvature across lamellar, double&#8208;gyroid cubic, and reverse micellar phases, and integrating structural, thermodynamic, and ultrafast spectroscopies, we show that geometry controls the dimensionality and mobility of the hydrogen&#8208;bond network. Planar interfaces enforce 2D networks that slow down interfacial water through spatial constrain, whereas curved bicontinuous and micellar topologies promote 3D networks with accelerated reorientation. These findings reveal a geometric principle for governing water dynamics in soft nanoconfinement, providing molecular level design rules for confined transport and reactivity in membranes and functional materials.

         <title>Modulating Li+ and Polysulfide Solvation with Low&#8208;Density Moderately Solvating Electrolytes for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;density, nonfluorinated moderately solvating electrolyte (MSE) composed of methyl tert&#8211;butyl ether concurrently tunes Li+ and polysulfide solvation, lowering desolvation barrier and mitigating polysulfide shuttling. It effectively stabilizes both electrodes and enables stable cycling of Li&#8211;S batteries under practical parameters at room temperature and 45&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries show great promise as the next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries, yet they still suffer from polysulfide shuttling and interphasial instability. Electrolyte, as the medium for ion transport and sulfur conversion, plays a crucial role in overcoming these challenges. Here, we introduce a moderately solvating electrolyte (MSE) based on low&#8208;density, low&#8208;viscosity, and nonfluorinated ether co&#8208;solvents that balances polysulfide suppression, Li metal stabilization, and redox kinetics. Through multiple solvent&#8211;solvent and solvent&#8208;ion interactions, the optimized MSE weakens Li+&#8208;solvent pairing while strengthening cation&#8211;anion interactions, thereby lowering the desolvation barrier and promoting the formation of a favorable solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI). Meanwhile, MSE limits the polysulfide dissolution but improves the accessibility of active material through better wettability and tailored solvation environment, leading to an altered sulfur deposition mechanism with &#946; &#8211; &#945; conversion. This approach enables a stable cycling of high&#8208;mass loading Li&#8211;S cells (&gt; 3.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) at both room temperature and 45&#160;&#176;C (where shuttling and side reactions are severer), and demonstrates a pouch cell with lean electrolyte content (4.5&#160;&#181;L mg s&#8722;1). This work highlights a practical route to develop high&#8208;performance electrolyte for Li&#8211;S cells and provides mechanistic insights into their operation.

         <title>Intermolecular Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of Un&#8208;Activated C(sp3)&#9472;H Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni: a new solution for asymmetric C(sp3)&#9472;H activation. The stereoselective synthesis of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic centres is achieved via enantioselective C(sp3)&#9472;H arylation using a Ni&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived catalyst. Rational catalytic cycle design uncovers a new reaction pathway that can efficiently induce chiral information during the stereoselective and rate&#8208;determining metalation event.








Abstract
We report the first example of an intermolecular, enantioselective Ni(II)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#9472;H arylation, providing direct access to challenging all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic centers. Key to this success is the use of a specially designed BINOL&#8208;derived ligand, which enables efficient desymmetrization of gem&#8208;dimethyl groups through a rate&#8208; and enantio&#8208;determining C&#9472;H activation step. This catalytic system demonstrates remarkable functional group tolerance, affording a wide variety of arylated products in high yields (up to 85%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 95:5 e.r.). Mechanistic studies, combining kinetic isotope effect measurements, deuterium labeling, and DFT calculations, reveal that the Ni&#8211;BINOL complex promotes a unique concerted metalation&#8211;deprotonation pathway assisted by ligand coordination and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. This work establishes nickel as a powerful and sustainable alternative to precious metals for asymmetric C&#9472;H activation, opening new perspectives for the construction of enantioenriched quaternary carbon centers of high relevance in drug discovery and materials science.

&lt;p&gt;We report the first example of an intermolecular, enantioselective Ni(II)-catalyzed C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H arylation, providing direct access to challenging all-carbon quaternary stereogenic centers. Key to this success is the use of a specially designed BINOL-derived ligand, which enables efficient desymmetrization of gem-dimethyl groups through a rate- and enantio-determining C&#9472;H activation step. This catalytic system demonstrates remarkable functional group tolerance, affording a wide variety of arylated products in high yields (up to 85%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 95:5 e.r.). Mechanistic studies, combining kinetic isotope effect measurements, deuterium labeling, and DFT calculations, reveal that the Ni&#8211;BINOL complex promotes a unique concerted metalation&#8211;deprotonation pathway assisted by ligand coordination and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. This work establishes nickel as a powerful and sustainable alternative to precious metals for asymmetric C&#9472;H activation, opening new perspectives for the construction of enantioenriched quaternary carbon centers of high relevance in drug discovery and materials science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of Asymmetric Lithium Salts with Multi&#8208;Functional Capabilities for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed asymmetric lithium salt, LiDMTFSI, features an electron&#8208;donating dimethylamino group that creates a &#8220;push&#8208;pull&#8221; effect to modulate solvation chemistry. This design enables high LiNO3 solubility and an anion&#8208;rich solvation sheath, resulting in a robust inorganic SEI, high Li+ transference number, and suppressed Al corrosion for stable high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) face severe interfacial instability in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, where solvent&#8208;centric solvation structures drive the formation of fragile, organic&#8208;rich solid&#8211;electrolyte interphases (SEIs). However, existing strategies mainly rely on solvent engineering, whereas lithium salt design remains underexplored. Herein, we design an asymmetric lithium salt, lithium (N, N&#8208;dimethylsulfamoyl) (trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiDMTFSI), featuring an electron&#8208;donating dimethylamino group that enhances the anion's nucleophilicity and Lewis basicity. By introducing a push&#8208;pull effect on the anionic charge, LiDMTFSI shifts the solvation structure from solvent&#8208;rich to anion&#8208;rich, thereby facilitating the co&#8208;dissolution of beneficial lithium salt. The resulting solvent&#8208;deficient solvation sheath governs the interphasial chemistry to favor the formation of a compact inorganic&#8208;rich SEI (e.g., LiF, Li2O, Li3N, Li2S, and other beneficial components) with excellent mechanical integrity and interfacial ion transport, enabling uniform Li deposition and mitigating parasitic side&#8208;reactions. A high Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of 99.1% was achieved in dilute carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, and full cells with ultrathin Li anodes and high&#8208;loading NMC811 cathodes demonstrated consistent operation for over 120 cycles with 83% capacity retention at a high voltage of 4.3&#160;V. These findings underscore the potential of anion molecular design as a powerful strategy for interphasial engineering in high&#8208;energy LMBs.

         <title>Autocatalytic Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented autocatalytic cycle, mediated by the reduction of Ru(NH3)63+ and arising from the synergistic interplay between oxalate (C2O42&#8722;) and peroxydisulfate (S2O82&#8722;) via their radical intermediates, prompts ECL emission from Ru(bpy)32+ at potentials as low as &#8208;0.2&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl. This system generates ECL without direct oxidation of the luminophore, but instead through a cascade of redox&#8208;mediated electron transfers triggered by the mild reduction of Ru(NH3)63+.








Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a powerful analytical technique that generates light through electrochemically induced reactions, enabling ultrasensitive biosensing and imaging of submicrometric objects. Conventional ECL systems, such as those using Ru(bpy)32&#8314; and tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA), require high applied potentials (oxidation at &#8764;1.4&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl), leading to electrode surface modification and parasitic reactions. Herein, we present a novel autocatalytic ECL mechanism that drastically lowers the triggering potential to &#8722;0.2&#160;V by exploiting the synergistic interplay between oxalate (C2O42&#8722;) and peroxydisulfate (S2O82&#8722;) radicals, mediated by Ru(NH3)63+ reduction. This system generates ECL without direct oxidation of the luminophore, but instead through a mild reduction process, relying on homogeneous radical reactions (SO4&#8226;&#8722; and CO2&#8226;&#8722;) to populate the Ru(bpy)32&#8314;* excited state. Experimental investigation at different Ru(NH3)63+/S2O82&#8722;/C2O42&#8722; concentration ratios, backed by finite element simulations, demonstrates the autocatalytic cycle's capability of exciting luminophores with a bandgap as high as 2.77&#160;eV (blue&#8208;emitting Ir(III) complex), while also showing a more stable ECL emission and achieving an emitting layer as thick as &#8764;4.8 &#177; 0.2&#160;&#181;m. These findings establish a low&#8208;potential ECL pathway with a large emitting layer, extending the applicability of such nontoxic coreactants&#8212;historically limited by their short&#8208;lived radicals&#8212;and potentially paving the way for new frontiers in ECL.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Aluminum&#8208;Zinc Hydrogen&#8208;Aided Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
The aluminum&#8211;zinc hydrogen&#8208;aided battery (AZ&#8208;HAB) is a novel low&#8208;temperature rechargeable battery. It features a redesigned dual&#8208;electrode system, incorporating an Al@Zn composite anode and replacing the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). This design enables rapid charging, low overpotential, and high&#8208;rate cycling stability under extreme cold conditions (&#8211;20 &#176;C to &#8211;40 &#176;C), offering a viable high&#8208;performance solution for energy storage in cold regions.








Abstract
The need for reliable power sources in cold environments drives the development of efficient low&#8208;temperature batteries. While zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) are promising due to low cost, high safety, and environmental compatibility, their performance at low temperatures is limited by sluggish kinetics. Here, we report an aluminum&#8208;zinc hydrogen&#8208;aided battery (AZ&#8208;HAB) that overcomes this limitation through a synergistic redesign of both electrodes. At the cathode, the kinetically favorable hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) replaces the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), reducing the charging potential and enhancing high&#8208;rate performance at low temperatures. The anode uses a composite structure (Al@Zn) with Zn pre&#8208;deposited on Al, leveraging Al's high activity and low deposition overpotential. This design reduces the full&#8208;cell resistance to one&#8208;third that of bare Zn, promotes uniform Zn deposition, and lowers polarization by 200&#160;mV at 150&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The synergistic effect of both electrodes accelerates reaction kinetics, enabling an 11&#8208;fold longer cycle life than conventional ZABs at&#160;&#8722;20 &#176;C. This work presents a viable strategy for high&#8208;performance energy storage and electric vehicles in extremely cold environments.

         <title>Synergistic Action of Crystallophore and Imaging&#8208;Crystallophore Enhances the Production and Imaging of Protein Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Imaging&#8208;crystallophore (Im&#8208;Xo4), a Tb(III) complex substituted by &#960;&#8208;conjugated antennas emits in the green and accumulates in the protein crystals, enabling an easy crystal detection using fluorescence microscopy. However, its nucleating properties are not as effective as ones of Tb&#8208;Xo4.

Abstract
The synthesis and photophysical characterization of a new family of terbium(III) complexes called Imaging&#8208;crystallophore, substituted by &#960;&#8208;conjugated antennas, is reported. Previous crystallophore variants (such as Tb&#8208;Xo4) have shown very interesting nucleating properties to obtain high&#8208;quality protein crystals. In addition, the Imaging&#8208;crystallophore emits in the green and accumulates in the protein crystals, enabling very easy crystal detection using fluorescence microscopy under one&#8208;photon but also under two&#8208;photon excitations. X&#8208;ray diffraction crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the binding site of the Imaging&#8208;crystallophore in hen&#8208;egg white lysozyme (HEWL) is similar to that of the Tb&#8208;Xo4 but present additional hydrophobic interactions with the conjugated antennas. However, its nucleating properties are not as effective as those of Tb&#8208;Xo4. Finally, we emphasize the synergy between the two generations of crystallophore by preparing and analyzing the properties of the mix (10/0.2) corresponding to a mixture of Tb&#8208;Xo4 and Imaging&#8208;crystallophore. By combining the best of nucleating and imaging properties, we can easily obtain and detect high&#8208;quality protein crystals

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Defined Polysulfates via S(VI)&#8208;Fluoride Exchange Iterative Exponential Growth (SuFEx IEG)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
SuFEx iterative exponential growth enables the synthesis of uniform polysulfates, block copolymers (BCPs), and cyclic polymers through orthogonal activation of SuFEx&#8208;inactive groups. This modular platform also produces sequence&#8208;defined polysulfates that encode 16&#8208;bit information as an aperiodic arrangement of two building blocks, demonstrating programmable molecular design.








Abstract
Leveraging the high reactivity, modularity, and orthogonality of the S(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reaction, a new addition to click chemistry, we report here the SuFEx iterative exponential growth (SuFEx IEG) method for synthesizing uniform polymers and block copolymers (BCPs) with molecular weights up to 21&#160;kDa. The key step in SuFEx IEG was the on&#8208;demand, orthogonal activation of the pair of functional groups, the SuFEx&#8208;inactive tetrahydropyranyl and imidazylate groups, into SuFEx&#8208;active tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) and sulfonyl fluoride. With SuFEx IEG, we demonstrate the synthetic encoding of 16&#8208;bit information into the sequence&#8208;defined polysulfate of diphenyl sulfide and diphenyl ether. The modular nature of the SuFEx click reaction enabled the synthesis of uniform polysulfates, including hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based polysulfates, that served as modules to create block copolymers (BCPs) and triblock copolymers without molecular weight distribution. The chain ends of the polymers and BCPs produced via SuFEx IEG were used to prepare uniform cyclic polymers and BCPs via intramolecular SuFEx cyclization. The SuFEx IEG method provides a robust and versatile approach for precisely constructing uniform linear and cyclic polymers, as well as sequence&#8208;defined polymers, across a broad molecular weight range.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Melonine and (+)&#8208;N4&#8208;Oxy Melonine Enabled by an Intramolecular Alkene Diamination Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complexity&#8208;generating intramolecular alkene diamination constitutes the pivotal step in the enantioselective synthesis of the title natural products featuring a strained, cage&#8208;like pentacyclic architecture. 








Abstract
Among more than four thousand monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) isolated to date, only a few feature a 2,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted indoline moiety. (+)&#8208;Melonine and (+)&#8208;N4&#8208;oxy melonine possess a highly rearranged carbon framework, presumably arising from cyclization of a rearranged iminium ion of quebrachamine precursor. We report herein the first enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;melonine and (+)&#8208;N4&#8208;oxy melonine featuring: a) a highly enantioselective CBS reduction followed by a stereospecific Johnson&#8208;Claisen rearrangement for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;substituted &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated ester; b) Bower's bis&#8208;cyclizative diamination of alkene, enabling the conversion of a functionalized cycloheptene to the tetracyclic core of the natural products; and c) an AlMe3&#8208;mediated lactamization that concurrently achieves desymmetrization at the C20 prochiral center.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Proximity Labeling Strategy Identifies TrxR1 as a Cuproprotein that Regulates Apoptosis via Caspase&#8208;3 S&#8208;Nitrosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We used APEX2 and TurboID&#8208;based proximity labeling with ATOX1 as the bait to broadly capture potential cuproproteins. We ultimately characterized a previously unrecognized cuproprotein thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) and solved the cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) structure of the homodimeric TrxR1 in the presence of copper at 3.0&#8208;&#197; resolution. We show that copper binding significantly diminishes the enzymatic activity of TrxR1 and copper&#8208;induced inactivation of TrxR1 leads to an increase in cellular S&#8208;nitrosylated proteins (SNO proteins).








Abstract
Copper (Cu) performs essential structural and functional roles in all aerobic organisms, but identifying natural cuproproteins through traditional affinity methods is hindered by the variety of copper ligand combinations and binding locations in proteins. Here, using ATOX1 as a bait, fused with the APEX2 or TurboID proximity labeling enzymes, with quantitative proteomics in cancer and normal cells (H1299 and HEK293T), we predicted 682 highly enriched candidate Cu&#8208;binding proteins. Among them, we functionally validated the novel cuproprotein, thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1). Through cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM), we resolved three copper&#8208;binding sites across its N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal redox centers. Functional assays demonstrated that copper inhibits TrxR1 reductase activity and impairs the denitrosylation function of its substrate, thioredoxin 1 (Trx1), consequently inhibiting caspase&#8208;3 cleavage and apoptosis. Beyond expanding the scope of annotated cuproproteins, this study provides a versatile strategy for cuproprotein discovery and defines the copper functions in modulating apoptosis through the TrxR1/Trx1 regulatory module.

         <title>Selective N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Peptides and Proteins Using Fatty Acyl Phosphates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective modification of peptides and proteins is vital for their development as therapeutics. Here, the adenylation domain of a carboxylic acid reductase enzyme from Segniliparus rugosus (CARsr&#8208;A) was used to generate reactive acyl adenylates in situ from carboxylic acids. Functionalized and simple fatty acids were incorporated with excellent selectivity at the N&#8208;termini of therapeutically relevant peptides and proteins.








Abstract
The selective modification of proteins and peptides is an important chemical biology tool with a wide variety of applications, including the production of biopharmaceuticals or the study of post&#8208;translational modifications. In particular, the selective acylation of the N&#8208;terminus over side chains in peptides and proteins is a highly desirable but challenging reaction in this field. Current methods have a range of shortcomings, including lack of selectivity or narrow substrate scope. Here we report a biomimetic approach using the in situ enzymatic reagent activation (ERA) of carboxylic acids with ATP to generate acyl&#8208;adenosine monophosphates. This method displays high selectivity for the N&#8208;termini of peptides and proteins, including pharmaceutically relevant liraglutide, glucagon and insulin. The ERA acylation tolerates a broad range of unsubstituted and substituted fatty acids, including azido and dicarboxylic acids, thus making it suitable for N&#8208;terminal bioorthogonal labelling strategies. Moreover, this strategy can also be applied to the modification of antibodies. In general, the ERA acylation is a versatile and bioorthogonal method that we envisage finding wider applications in the field of bioconjugation and the production of stable peptide and protein conjugates.

&lt;p&gt;The selective modification of proteins and peptides is an important chemical biology tool with a wide variety of applications, including the production of biopharmaceuticals or the study of post-translational modifications. In particular, the selective acylation of the N-terminus over side chains in peptides and proteins is a highly desirable but challenging reaction in this field. Current methods have a range of shortcomings, including lack of selectivity or narrow substrate scope. Here we report a biomimetic approach using the in situ enzymatic reagent activation (ERA) of carboxylic acids with ATP to generate acyl-adenosine monophosphates. This method displays high selectivity for the N-termini of peptides and proteins, including pharmaceutically relevant liraglutide, glucagon and insulin. The ERA acylation tolerates a broad range of unsubstituted and substituted fatty acids, including azido and dicarboxylic acids, thus making it suitable for N-terminal bioorthogonal labelling strategies. Moreover, this strategy can also be applied to the modification of antibodies. In general, the ERA acylation is a versatile and bioorthogonal method that we envisage finding wider applications in the field of bioconjugation and the production of stable peptide and protein conjugates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tunable Charge Transport Properties Through Precise &#960;&#8208;Stacking Modulation in Isostructural Porous Molecular Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsic structure&#8211;property relationship in through&#8208;space conductive MOFs is investigated using a series of counterion&#8208;free porous molecular conductors (PMC&#8208;3) with carrier&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;stacked columns. The constant carrier density and halide&#8208;dependent tunable &#960;&#8208;stacking geometry in PMC&#8208;3 enable the discovery of a linear correlation between the lattice parameter along the &#960;&#8208;stacking direction and charge transport properties.








Abstract
Understanding the structure&#8211;property relationships in electrically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is critical for their rational design toward practical applications. Since single crystals of MOFs with through&#8208;space conductive &#960;&#8208;stacked columnar structures are relatively easy to obtain, their structures can be determined with high accuracy. However, elucidating those structure&#8211;property relationships without interference from carrier scattering and variations in carrier concentration remains challenging. Herein, we synthesized three isostructural porous molecular conductors (denoted as PMC&#8208;3) via electrocrystallization using a redox&#8208;active N,N&#8217;&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxdiimide (NDI&#8208;py) ligand and ZnX2 (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I). Single crystals of PMC&#8208;3 exhibit high electrical conductivity (&#8764;10&#8722;3&#160;S cm&#8722;1), comparable to the highest values reported for NDI&#8208;based crystalline materials. Moreover, PMC&#8208;3 serves as a model system for probing structure&#8211;property relationships in through&#8208;space conductive MOFs, offering three key advantages. First, the absence of counterions, eliminating carrier scattering; second, identical carrier concentrations across the series, allowing isolation of the effects of &#960;&#8208;stacking geometry on transport properties; and third, tunable &#960;&#8208;stacking geometries via halide ligand substitution. As a result, a linear correlation between the lattice parameter along the stacking axis and intrinsic charge transport properties is revealed, representing a significant advance in understanding charge transport in through&#8208;space conductive MOFs.

         <title>An Expanded Toolbox for Versatile Chemical Editing of Adeno&#8208;Associated Virus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>

We describe technology to introduce diverse non&#8208;natural chemical functionalities site&#8208;specifically into the capsid of adeno&#8208;associated virus through genetic code expansion, and using them to engineer this leading vector for human gene therapy for enhanced tissue specificity and reduced immunogenicity








Abstract
Site&#8208;specific incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into the adeno&#8208;associated virus (AAV) capsid offers powerful opportunities to probe and engineer the properties of this leading vector for human gene therapy. However, this approach currently relies almost exclusively on a single azide&#8208;containing ncAA, incorporated using the pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair. Here, we substantially broaden the scope of this technology by demonstrating successful incorporation of numerous ncAAs into AAV capsid using four different platforms, and by uncovering design principles that facilitate capsid tolerance to structurally diverse side chains. Using this expanded toolbox, we incorporate several different bioorthogonal conjugation handles into AAV for precise capsid modification. In particular, a tetrazine&#8208;containing ncAA facilitated ultrafast conjugation of an anti&#8208;HER2 nanobody to the capsid, creating conjugates that efficiently and selectively infect HER2+&#160;cells. We further used this platform for optimized capsid PEGylation, which reduced its immunogenicity without compromising infectivity. Finally, we efficiently incorporated two distinct ncAAs into the AAV capsid, and subsequently labeled them orthogonally to attach two different entities. Together, these advances dramatically expand the chemistries that can be introduced into the AAV capsid, offering powerful new tools to both probe and engineer the properties of this promising gene therapy vector.

         <title>Efficient Preparation of Homogenous Antibody Conjugates via Glycosite&#8208;Specific Transglycosylation Enabled by Readily Available Glycosyl Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A streamlined platform for glycosite&#8208;specific antibody conjugation is enabled by LacNAc&#8208;derived cyclic acetal donors, which can be prepared in only two steps and used directly in single&#8208;enzyme Endo S2&#8208;mediated transglycosylation. The platform supports the broad construction of homogeneous gsADCs and gsDACs, with donor 7 producing glycoengineered antibodies that exhibit markedly enhanced stability toward Endo S2&#8208;mediated hydrolysis. 








Abstract
Site&#8208;specific antibody conjugation through glycoengineering offers a promising route to generate homogeneous glycosite&#8208;specific antibody&#8210;drug conjugates (gsADCs) with improved therapeutic indices. Dozens of gsADCs are advancing from preclinical studies to clinical trials. However, current methods involve either multiple enzymes or lengthy preparation of substrates. Herein, we report a novel and synthetically streamlined platform utilizing LacNAc&#8208;derived 4,6&#8208;acetal glycosyl donors for glycosite&#8208;specific transglycosylation mediated by a single enzyme. These glycosyl donors can be synthesized in as few as two steps, representing a major advancement in synthetic accessibility compared to previously reported glycosyl donors, which often require more than 15 steps. Computational analysis showed that the acetal ring restricts conformation, directing donor 7 to a &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;stabilized groove of the enzyme. Donor 7, along with a positive control, was evaluated in the context of gsADCs, consistently demonstrating potent and selective cytotoxicity toward HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells, while sparing HER2&#8208;negative cells. Furthermore, donor 7 was successfully adapted to generate glycosite&#8208;specific degrader&#8208;antibody conjugates (gsDACs), highlighting its broad utility. Additional studies revealed that donor 7 produces antibodies with markedly enhanced resistance to Endo S2 mediated hydrolysis. Together, these findings establish a practical and broadly applicable platform for glycosite&#8208;specific antibody conjugation, paving the way for next&#8208;generation antibody&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Regulation of the D&#8208;Band Center Through Ligand Engineering in Silver Cluster&#8208;Based MOFs Enhances Acidic CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;engineered regulation of d&#8208;band center in silver cluster&#8208;based MOFs facilitates CO2 adsorption and reaction intermediate activation, achieving high performance of electroreduction of CO2 to CO under acidic conditions.








Abstract
Acidic electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) offers a promising way for achieving high CO2 utilization efficiency and circumventing carbonate deposition issues. However, it is plagued by a compromised catalytic performance due to the severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, two types of silver chalcogenolate cluster&#8208;based MOFs were synthesized through ligand engineering by anchoring Ag12 clusters with tri&#8208;topic imidazole and pyridyl ligands respectively. The imidazole&#8208;based MOF Ag12THIT demonstrated outstanding performance for the electroreduction of CO2 to CO. In acidic electrolyte of pH&#160;&#8776;&#160;2, it achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.5% with a commercial current density of 328.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at&#160;&#8722;&#160;1.6&#160;V versus RHE. Moreover, the CO partial current density (jCO) reached a maximum of 447.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a FECO of 96.8% at&#160;&#8722;&#160;1.7&#160;V versus RHE. No obvious degradation was observed during 70&#160;h of continuous operation, and the performance significantly outperformed those of pyridyl&#8208;based MOFs Ag12TPEB and Ag12TPMA. Mechanistic studies revealed that the imidazole ligand endows Ag12THIT with enhanced Lewis basicity and superior &#963;&#8208;donating ability, thereby strengthening the ligand field with an upshifted d&#8208;band center and reduced energy barriers. This ligand effect facilitates more efficient electron transfer to *COOH intermediates, thus promoting acidic CO2 to CO conversion.

The imidazole-based MOF &lt;b&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;THIT&lt;/b&gt; demonstrated outstanding performance for the electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO. In acidic electrolyte of pH&#160;&#8776;&#160;2, it achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.5% with a commercial current density of 328.0&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at&#160;&#8722;&#160;1.6&#160;V versus RHE. Moreover, the CO partial current density (&lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;) reached a maximum of 447.2&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; of 96.8% at&#160;&#8722;&#160;1.7&#160;V versus RHE. No obvious degradation was observed during 70&#160;h of continuous operation, and the performance significantly outperformed those of pyridyl-based MOFs &lt;b&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;TPEB&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;TPMA&lt;/b&gt;. Mechanistic studies revealed that the imidazole ligand endows &lt;b&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;THIT&lt;/b&gt; with enhanced Lewis basicity and superior &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-donating ability, thereby strengthening the ligand field with an upshifted &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center and reduced energy barriers. This ligand effect facilitates more efficient electron transfer to *COOH intermediates, thus promoting acidic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Nonviral Neo&#8208;Nucleocapsid for Cell&#8208;Specific RNA Delivery Developed by Pseudo&#8208;Cyclic Peptide Grafting and Directed Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonviral neo&#8208;nucleocapsids developed from a repurposed bacterial protein cage, and macrocyclic peptide pharmacophores via protein&#8208;protein ligation, bacteria&#8208;based directed evolution, lasso&#8208;grafting, and mammalian cell&#8208;based directed evolution enabled cell specific RNA delivery.








Abstract
Nonviral protein vehicles for RNA delivery hold significant promises for various biotechnological applications due to their scalability, ease of engineering, and high biocompatibility. Directed evolution is a powerful approach to enhance protein activity, yet few nonviral protein vehicles have been evolved due to the challenges in linking genotype and phenotype. Here, we report engineering and directed evolution of a neo&#8208;nucleocapsid enabling receptor&#8208;specific RNA delivery. We applied the DogTag/DogCatcher protein ligation system to an artificial nucleocapsid and conducted directed evolution to obtain nucleocapsid displaying proteins. To create designer neo&#8208;nucleocapsids, we lasso&#8208;grafted a pharmacophore sequence of a pseudo&#8208;cyclic peptide binding to the hepatocyte growth factor receptor MET into the loop of DogCatcher. After the cellular&#8208;based directed evolution, endocytic uptake of neo&#8208;nucleocapsids was improved whereas cytosolic release and subsequent protein expression from the delivered RNA were not detected. This experimental approach provides a versatile system for constructing protein cages delivering various cargos to specific cells.

         <title>Fluorogenic Rhodamine Probes Enable High&#8208;Resolution Visualization of Plasma Membrane Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bright, wash&#8208;free, and serum&#8208;compatible, RSD2 is a rhodamine&#8208;based probe that enables long&#8208;term imaging of plasma membrane substructures, pseudopodia, nanotubes, and migrasomes, with high specificity and minimal cytotoxicity. Its strong fluorogenicity and photoswitching behavior support super&#8208;resolution microscopy, revealing dynamic membrane processes, nanoparticle trafficking, and nanoscale architecture in diverse live and fixed cell types.








Abstract
The plasma membrane exhibits diverse substructures, such as pseudopodia, membrane nanotubes, and migrasomes, that are essential for cellular communication and cargo transport. Imaging these fine structures remains challenging due to their nanoscale dimensions and limitations of existing fluorescent probes. Here, we report the development of two rhodamine&#8208;based probes, RSD1 and RSD2, incorporating anionic membrane&#8208;anchoring groups and pyrrolidine auxochromes to enable wash&#8208;free, serum&#8208;compatible, long&#8208;term plasma membrane imaging. RSD2, in particular, demonstrates superior fluorogenicity, brightness, and photoswitching properties, facilitating high&#8208;resolution imaging in both live and fixed cells. It selectively labels membrane substructures across diverse cell types and maintains membrane specificity in the presence of serum. RSD2 is compatible with advanced microscopy techniques including confocal microscopy, instant structured illumination microscopy (iSIM), and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), achieving up to 40&#160;nm resolution. Using two&#8208;color dSTORM, we visualize silica nanoparticle trafficking via membrane nanotubes and gondola&#8208;like bulges in neuronal cells, marking the first such observation. RSD2 also enables imaging of migrasomes and retraction fibers, revealing dynamic membrane&#8208;mediated transport processes. This probe offers a robust and versatile platform for investigating membrane architecture and function, with broad applicability in cell biology, nanomedicine, and super&#8208;resolution imaging.

         <title>Dynamic Modulation of H&#183; to H&#8722;&amp;H+ Enabled by Chemical Looping for Hydrogenation&#8208;Dehydrogenation Tandem Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provided a dynamic modulation strategy for hydrogen species in hydrogenation&#8208;dehydrogenation coupling reaction systems. By constructing an &#8220;electron allocator&#8221; through metal vacancy&#8208;induced electron delocalization, the allocator facilitates electron donation and acquisition via a chemical looping process, achieving the conversion of homolytically dissociated H&#183; into highly active H&#8722;&amp;H+ species and ultimately achieving synergistic enhancement of both the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes.








Abstract
Coupling hydrogenation and dehydrogenation is of great significance, as both are pivotal bond reconstruction modes and co&#8208;occur in about 10% of chemical syntheses. However, stoichiometric imbalance often necessitates exogenous hydrogen, which causes &#8220;seesaw effect&#8221; and inhibits dehydrogenation, challenging thermodynamics and kinetics of tandem process. Herein, we propose a dynamic strategy based on chemical looping to modulate hydrogen species. We designed Run@NiCu&#8208;VM catalyst with metal vacancy (VM) induced &#8220;electron allocator&#8221; properties, enabling reversible electron capture and release via chemical looping, which drives the neutral H&#183; to convert into H&#8722;&amp;H+, while simultaneously completing electron cycling. The converted H&#8722;&amp;H+ promote hydrogenation of polar &#9472;C&#9552;N bonds in the tandem reaction of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;furandimethanamine, while neutral H&#183; enhances the dehydrogenation rate by avoiding charge repulsion with H&#8722;&amp;H+ generated from dehydrogenation of &#9472;CH2OH. The coupled hydrogenation&#8208;dehydrogenation process achieves a 1.7&#8208;fold rate enhancement, delivers 92% 2,5&#8208;furandimethanamine yield, outperforms most reported catalysts, and exhibits broad substrate applicability.

         <title>Realizing Cocktail Effects in Catalytic High&#8208;Entropy Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (HEMOFs) via Predictive Density of State Calculations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a computationally led approach to predicting synergistic cocktail effects in high&#8208;entropy metal&#8211;organic frameworks (HEMOFs). Density functional theory (DFT) was employed to investigate a key intermediate for CO2 epoxidation, establishing a correlation between composition and catalytic activity based on differences in the valence edge peak in the band gap. Synthesized HEMOFs validated DFT predictions, confirming an optimal composition with 40% greater activity than the least active variant.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials, particularly high&#8208;entropy metal&#8211;organic frameworks (HEMOFs), represent a promising class of catalysts amenable to imparting superior activity via harnessing cocktail effects. However, optimal leveraging of these effects remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we introduce a promising, computationally driven roadmap for the rational selection of metal compositions in catalytic HEMOFs. Density functional theory (DFT) was first used to probe a key catalytic intermediate for CO2 epoxidation in a series of compositionally related high&#8208;entropy polynuclear clusters. A direct correlation between composition and predicted catalytic activity trends was established, capitalizing on clear differences in a new valence edge peak in the band gap as function of active metal site. Following that, a series of HEMOFs with DFT&#8208;predetermined compositions were successfully synthesized. Remarkably, catalytic tests demonstrated the trends predicted by DFT, emphasizing the direct correlation between electronic structure and activity. The DFT&#8208;predicted optimal HEMOF composition was validated experimentally and shown to exhibit over 40% greater activity than the least active variant. The strategy described herein demonstrates the immense promise of harnessing cocktail effects in HEMOFs, wherein synergistic intermetallic effects impart superior catalytic activity. Finally, this work serves as a first step toward enabling machine learning&#8208;driven approaches to optimize catalytic performance through tailored metal compositions.

         <title>SSZ&#8208;13 Zeolite with Isolated Co2+ Sites as an Efficient and Durable Catalyst System for Non&#8208;Oxidative Ethane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalysts with the isolated Co2+ species in the 6MR (Co2+&#9472;Z2) and 8MR ([Co(OH)]+&#9472;Z) windows of the SSZ&#8208;13 zeolite were synthesized for non&#8208;oxidative ethane dehydrogenation to ethene. The Co2+&#9472;Z2 species demonstrate an unexpectedly high rate of ethene formation in comparison with the ([Co(OH)]+&#9472;Z species. The most active developed catalyst with Co2+&#9472;Z2 outperforms analogues of commercial K&#8208;CrOx/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 in terms of ethene formation.








Abstract
Non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (EDH) is an attractive method for on&#8208;purpose ethene production, but achieving high activity and, especially, durability with catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant metals remains challenging. Herein, we introduce the Co/SSZ&#8208;13 system with exclusively divalent cobalt (Co2+) ions that meets the above requirements. The use of complementary characterization techniques enabled us to reveal two Co2+ species: Co2+&#9472;Z2 located in the six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring windows and [Co(OH)]+&#9472;Z in the eight&#8208;membered&#8208;ring windows, with Z representing a charged zeolite framework site. A quantitative correlation between the rate of ethene formation and the site population establishes Co2+&#9472;Z2 as the active species. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy confirms their structural and electronic stability under high&#8208;temperature reaction conditions. The optimized 0.9Co/SSZ&#8208;13 (0.9Co) catalyst showed highly durable operation over 200 dehydrogenation/oxidative regeneration cycles at 600&#8211;650&#176;C lasting for 150 h with industrially relevant productivity. In this regard, it outperforms almost all previously developed catalysts even those with platinum as an active component. The obtained results uncover the atomic&#8208;level origins of EDH activity/durability of the Co/SSZ&#8208;13 system and highlight the critical role of metal site location in designing highly active, selective, and durable catalysts for on&#8208;purpose ethene production.

         <title>Dual Modification Strategy of Ionic Liquid for Durable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>

A dual modification strategy utilizing 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole&#8208;hexafluorophosphate (BM) has been implemented to simultaneously improve the uniformity of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) and passivate defects in perovskite. The inverted perovskite solar cell (PSC) attains a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.59%, while the perovskite solar module (PSM) achieves an exceptional efficiency of 22.50% with an aperture area of 12.8&#160;cm2. Notably, these PSCs exhibits outstanding photostability, maintaining unchanged PCE even after 1000&#160;h of continuous solar irradiation.








Abstract
The inverted perovskite solar cell (PSC), featuring self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) as the hole transport layer, has achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 27%. However, the non&#8208;uniformity of SAMs and intrinsic defects within the perovskite film continue to constrain further enhancements in device performance. Herein, we developed a strategy for the synchronous modification of SAMs and perovskite by incorporating an ionic liquid of 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole&#8208;hexafluorophosphate (BM) to enhance the uniformity of SAMs and passivate defects in perovskite. Specifically, BM was incorporated into the perovskite precursor solution to effectively occupy halide vacancies and passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+. Meanwhile, owing to its ionic properties and the interaction between its functional groups and SAM, BM can effectively regulate the colloidal properties and reduce surface roughness, achieving a more uniform SAM layer. By employing this dual modification strategy, BM significantly modulates the crystallization kinetics, thereby facilitating the formation of highly crystalline perovskite films characterized by substantially enlarged grain sizes and a markedly reduced defect density. Consequently, the device incorporating dual modification of BM achieved a champion PCE of 26.59%, demonstrating exceptional operational stability with no observable PCE degradation after continuous power output at maximum power point (MPP) for 1000&#160;h.

         <title>A Surface Non&#8208;Destructive Modification Strategy Addressing Moisture and Oxidation Instabilities of Sulfide Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The practical application of sulfide solid electrolytes is hindered by inherent oxidative instability and high moisture sensitivity. Herein, we report an in situ, non&#8208;destructive surface modification strategy, in which nucleophilic S2&#8722; anions on Li6PS5Cl initiate ring&#8208;opening polymerization of ethylene sulfate to form a protective poly(sulfate) layer. This approach enables all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with NCM955 cathode to deliver 231.6&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#160;C and retain 70% capacity after 36,000 cycles at 10&#160;C.








Abstract
Sulfide solid electrolytes are promising candidates for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), owing to their high ionic conductivity and excellent interfacial conformability. However, their practical application is hindered by inherent oxidative instability and high moisture sensitivity. Herein, we propose an in situ, non&#8208;destructive modification strategy for sulfide electrolyte Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) by leveraging the nucleophilic S2&#8722; anions on its surface to initiate the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxathiolane 2,2&#8208;dioxide (ethylene sulfate, DTD), thus forming a uniform and dense poly(sulfate) (PS) modification layer. This layer effectively shields the electrolyte from direct exposure to moisture and high&#8208;voltage cathodes, greatly enhancing both moisture tolerance and oxidation stability. ASSBs fabricated with the modified PS&#8208;LPSC electrolyte, a high&#8208;nickel LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (NCM955) cathode and a LiIn anode, exhibit excellent electrochemical performance, delivering capacities of 231.6, 208.1, 138.3, and 98.5&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.2, 1, 10, and 20&#160;C, respectively, at room temperature. Remarkably, the cells retain 70.0% capacity after 36,000 cycles at 10&#160;C under room temperature, and 62.4% after 20,000 cycles even under harsh conditions (50&#160;C and 60&#160;&#176;C), demonstrating exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability and practical applicability. This study provides a facile and efficient surface modification route to enhance the oxidation and moisture stability of sulfide solid electrolytes.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Super&#8208;Resolution Tracking of mtDNA Remodeling and Inflammatory Release with a Selective Fluorescent Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents mtNARed, an mtDNA&#8208;selective probe for super&#8208;resolution imaging that enables nanoscale visualization and long&#8208;term tracking of mtDNA in living cells, including highly polarized sperm. Moreover, mtNARed reveals stress&#8208;induced mtDNA remodeling and inflammatory release, providing a new platform for real&#8208;time super&#8208;resolution studies of mitochondrial genome dynamics and immune activation.








Abstract
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is vital for mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis, with its spatiotemporal dynamics are tightly linked to development, metabolism, and disease progression. However, super&#8208;resolution tracking of mtDNA in live cells remains limited by lack of selective, photostable small&#8208;molecule probes. Here, we present mtNARed, a rationally engineered, wash&#8208;free fluorescent probe featuring a large Stokes&#8208;shift, and high photostability that enables super&#8208;resolution tracking of mtDNA dynamics in live cells using stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, with complementary readouts by fluorescence&#8208;lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). mtNARed precisely localizes to mitochondrial nucleoids and supports long&#8208;term imaging while minimizing interference from nuclear DNA. This capability generalizes across diverse mammalian cell types, including highly polarized sperm cells. Importantly, under mitochondrial stress or inflammatory stimulation, mtNARed reports in situ and at super&#8208;resolution of the progressive release of mtDNA, correlating with mitochondrial depolarization, membrane disintegration, and immune activation.

     alt="Real-Time Super-Resolution Tracking of mtDNA Remodeling and Inflammatory Release with a Selective Fluorescent Probe"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work presents mtNARed, an mtDNA-selective probe for super-resolution imaging that enables nanoscale visualization and long-term tracking of mtDNA in living cells, including highly polarized sperm. Moreover, mtNARed reveals stress-induced mtDNA remodeling and inflammatory release, providing a new platform for real-time super-resolution studies of mitochondrial genome dynamics and immune activation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is vital for mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis, with its spatiotemporal dynamics are tightly linked to development, metabolism, and disease progression. However, super-resolution tracking of mtDNA in live cells remains limited by lack of selective, photostable small-molecule probes. Here, we present mtNARed, a rationally engineered, wash-free fluorescent probe featuring a large Stokes-shift, and high photostability that enables super-resolution tracking of mtDNA dynamics in live cells using stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, with complementary readouts by fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). mtNARed precisely localizes to mitochondrial nucleoids and supports long-term imaging while minimizing interference from nuclear DNA. This capability generalizes across diverse mammalian cell types, including highly polarized sperm cells. Importantly, under mitochondrial stress or inflammatory stimulation, mtNARed reports in situ and at super-resolution of the progressive release of mtDNA, correlating with mitochondrial depolarization, membrane disintegration, and immune activation. This work provides a robust and versatile platform for advanced mtDNA imaging, opening opportunities to dissect mitochondrial genome dynamics, maintenance, and signaling across physiological and pathological states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of H2O2 by Spatially Separate Hydrogen and Oxygen Activation Sites on Tailored Pt&#8211;Au Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a Pt1Aun/TiO2 catalyst with isolated H2 and O2 activation sites. It achieves&#160;&gt;&#160;99% H2O2 selectivity, high productivity, and a &#8764;4&#160;wt.% concentration (double the anthraquinone process) in direct synthesis of H2O2. Pt single atoms dissociate H2, while Au nanoparticles stabilize O2, and the H2O2 forms via CH2O&#8208;mediated hydrogen transfer.








Abstract
The direct synthesis of H2O2 is considered an atom&#8208;efficient, environmentally friendly, and sustainable alternative to replace the current industrial route of the anthraquinone oxidation process. To date a viable direct replacement for the current industrial method of H2O2 production has yet to emerge, owing to the strong dissociation abilities of traditional Pd&#8208;based catalysts for both H2 and O2, which results in the over hydrogenation of H2O2 and limited catalytic activity. To address these concerns, this work outlines a novel non&#8208;Pd&#8208;based catalyst (Pt1Aun/TiO2), consisting of spatially separated H2 and O2 activation sites, which offers H2O2 selectivity (&#8764;100%) and productivity (128.6 mol&#183;gN.M.&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1), in excess of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art formulations. Crucially, via consecutive reactions, this system achieves net H2O2 concentrations approaching 4&#160;wt.%, which is double that generated in the initial stages of the Anthraquinone Oxidation Process. A detailed mechanistic study indicates that Pt single atoms selectively dissociate H2, while Au nanoparticles stabilize non&#8208;dissociative *O2&#8722; species. The H2O2 formation proceeds through CH2O&#8208;mediated hydrogen transfer, generating a hydrogen carrier (*CH2OH) that subsequently reacts with *O2&#8722; to produce H2O2.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Engineering of Polythiophene Probes for Multimodal Discrimination of PFAS via Conformational Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polythiophene derivative PT32 demonstrates selective and pH&#8211;robust, discriminative detection of PFOA/PFOS on multimodal (UV&#8211;vis/colorimetric/fluorescence) platforms. The unique sensing response is attributed to distinct conformational changes in PT32, facilitated by electrostatic, fluorophilic, and hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, PT32 can be facilely recovered post&#8211;detection, enabling sustainable environmental monitoring.








Abstract
Discriminating between perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), while suppressing interference from common surfactants, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), remains a persistent challenge. In this work, we tackled this challenge through a rational side&#8208;chain engineering strategy, designing a series of cationic polythiophenes that exploit analyte&#8208;specific conformational transitions for unprecedented selectivity. Among them, PT32 was utilized as a trimodal (UV&#8211;vis absorption, colorimetric, and fluorometric) probe, enabling discriminative detection of PFOA/PFOS and distinction from other anionic surfactants. The system demonstrates clear visual and spectral discriminability, with PFOA inducing a distinct pink color, PFOS producing an orange&#8208;red response, and SDS showing negligible color change. This selectivity stems from variable conformational changes in the PT32 backbone (e.g., random aggregation, extended conformation, and supramolecular aggregation), which are driven by synergistic electrostatic, fluorophilic, and hydrophobic interactions. The PT32 probe exhibited remarkably LOD of 41.61&#160;nM for PFOA and 25.71&#160;nM for PFOS in fluorescence&#8208;based detection and achieved excellent recovery rates in real sample tests. Interestingly, the probe could be recycled post&#8208;detection and use multiple times. Hence, the side&#8208;chain engineering strategy not only addresses long&#8208;standing challenges in discrimination but also establishes a versatile design principle for developing advanced molecular probes.

         <title>Design of Adsorption&#8210;Diffusion Dual&#8208;Driven MOF Membranes for Efficient CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the adsorption&#8211;diffusion dual&#8208;driven design principle and assisted by high&#8208;throughput computational screening, CAU&#8208;10pydc was identified as a promising membrane material. It experimentally achieved a CO2 permeability of 2847 Barrer and a CO2/CH4 selectivity of 185, surpassing the 2019 upper bound and demonstrating strong potential for industrial application.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer exceptional tunability in pore structure and functionality, holding considerable potential for advanced gas separation membranes. However, their advancement is restricted by the permeability&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;off and inefficient empirical screening. Herein, we propose an adsorption&#8211;diffusion dual&#8208;driven design strategy balancing moderate CO2 adsorption affinity (1 &lt; &#945;ads,HTCS&#160;&lt;&#160;10) and high CO2 diffusivity selectivity (&#945;diff,HTCS&#160;&gt;&#160;10) within a pore&#8208;limiting diameter range of 3.8&#8211;4.4&#160;&#197;. This rationale is corroborated by high&#8208;throughput computational screening and experimental membrane performance. Three yfm&#8208;topology MOF membranes&#8212;CAU&#8208;10H, CAU&#8208;10pydc, and KMF&#8208;1 with finely tuned pore microenvironments were synthesized, with the former two meeting the proposed criteria and KMF&#8208;1 serving as a counterexample. As anticipated, CAU&#8208;10H and CAU&#8208;10pydc exceed the 2019 upper bound for CO2/CH4 separation, with CAU&#8208;10pydc exhibiting a remarkable CO2 permeability of &#8764;2847 Barrer and a selectivity of 185, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. Moreover, despite sharing the same kinetic diameter as CO2, C2H2 exhibits 1.5 times higher adsorption affinity, resulting in a significantly lower permeability of only 39 Barrer under the same conditions. These results confirm the adsorption&#8211;diffusion dual&#8208;driven design principle, providing both theoretical insight and practical guidance for other challenging gas separation scenarios.

         <title>Radical Electroprecipitation from a Water|Oil|Electrode Interface Prolongs &#8220;Electro&#8221;Chemiluminescence of the Tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)Ruthenium(II) and Benzoyl Peroxide System by 103</title>

         <dc:description>
Multiphase systems, including ones with liquid&#8208;liquid phase boundaries, are the home to many curious chemistries including reaction acceleration and spontaneous formation of reactive species. Here we show the liquid&#8208;liquid interface causes electrochemiluminescence and afterglow chemiluminescence lifetime to be enhanced by 220,000% in&#8208;time, far beyond when the electrical potential is applied.








Abstract
Reactive intermediates, including radicals and other short&#8208;lived molecules, are ubiquitous in pure chemical processes and often highly difficult to isolate. Recently, we found that energetic, reactive radical species can be trapped through electroprecipitation, where the precipitate contains a reactive intermediate. The principle is straight&#8208;forward: If a solubility equilibrium can be exceeded before the reactive intermediate lifetime, the intermediate can be precipitated. Classically, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a process where electrical energy is transferred to chemical energy, and then the chemical energy is released in the form of light emission (often in the presence of an electroactive luminophore). The apparent luminescence lifetime, limited by radical lifetimes, of ECL reactions in solution is short (sub&#8208;microsecond), and thus can hinder the performance of the technique as light emission is confined to the electrode surface and occurs only when the electrical potential to the system is applied. Here, we show that with a high concentration (10&#8211;250&#160;mM) of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) being co&#8208;reduced with a tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) complex, we can achieve an ECL emission that lasts for hundreds of seconds after potential arrest, corresponding to a thousand&#8208;fold (103) increase in apparent afterglow chemiluminescence lifetimes. This electroprecipitation process occurs at an aqueous|organic multiphase boundary, which are present all through nature and are arguably more representative of natural chemical processes. Furthermore, experimental parameters, including BPO concentration, applied potential, and electrode material, were investigated. Competitive and parasitic processes, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction and decarboxylation, diminish the electroprecipitation of reactive intermediates, and we detail mitigation and optimization efforts. Overall, this work reveals that multiphase interfaces can be used to electroprecipitate reactive radicals, separating their use in space and time.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Engineering Guides the Design of &#946;&#8208;Sheet Inhibitor to Anchor Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amino acid side&#8208;chain engineering strategy, proposed based on the amino acid pairing in natural proteins, can modulate the complementarity of noncovalent interactions between side chains in engineered &#946;&#8208;sheets. This enables the construction of stable &#946;&#8208;sheet inhibitors for effective targeting of PD&#8208;L1.








Abstract
Customizing inhibitors for &#946;&#8208;sheet mediated protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) remains a challenge in medicinal chemistry research. Directly separating &#946;&#8208;sheet elements from the PPI interface as inhibitors represents a feasible strategy. Although useful, peptides derived from PPIs typically lose their natural secondary structure, resulting in low affinity. How to construct stable &#946;&#8208;sheet inhibitors remains elusive, mainly due to the lack of reliable strategies to guide the design of &#946;&#8208;sheet backbones. In this study, we propose an amino acid side&#8208;chain engineering strategy (AASE) to design of &#946;&#8208;sheet inhibitors. Specifically, this strategy was based on the amino acid pairing (AAP) principle observed in the &#946;&#8208;sheets of natural proteins, and further integrates the complementarity of various non&#8208;covalent interactions between &#946;&#8208;strand side chains. When combined with high&#8208;throughput peptide screening technology, above strategy can generate structurally defined &#946;&#8208;sheet inhibitors. We validated the physicochemical properties of the &#946;&#8208;sheet structures obtained under the aforementioned strategy and prioritized the peptide EH. The &#946;&#8208;sheet inhibitor formed by EH exhibits potent biological functions, enabling high&#8208;resolution imaging of tumors in the NIR window and guiding tumor resection. In addition, EH can inhibit tumor growth as a PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade. This strategy provides valuable guidance for the design of PPI inhibitors with &#946;&#8208;sheet structures.

         <title>Pore Space Multi&#8208;Layer Functionalization Boosting Industrial Radioactive Iodine Capture with Record Capacity and Exceptional Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of the pore space multiple&#8208;layer functionalization (PSMLF) strategy significantly enhances pore space utilization compared to traditional pore surface functionalization methods. Utilizing this strategy, PAF&#8208;1&#8208;NTM achieves a record&#8208;high iodine uptake of 88.58&#160;wt% and exhibits remarkable kinetics (k1&#160;=&#160;0.025&#160;min&#8722;1), surpassing all previously reported benchmark adsorbents under industrial conditions.








Abstract
Capturing radioactive molecular iodine (I2) from nuclear waste under industrial conditions remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we developed for the first time a pore space multiple&#8208;layer functionalization (PSMLF) strategy, which enables directionally distribute functional sites across the multi&#8208;layer regions of large pore space, thereby enhancing the I2 adsorption ability by optimizing pore space utilization. Utilizing this approach, the optimized adsorbent PAF&#8208;1&#8208;NTM achieves a record&#8208;high I2 uptake of 88.58&#160;wt% under simulated industrial conditions (150&#160;&#176;C and 150&#160;ppmv I2), a 108&#8208;fold improvement over its parent material, PAF&#8208;1. This performance significantly surpasses that of industrial Ag@MOR and all previously benchmarked adsorbents under the same conditions. Furthermore, adsorption kinetic of PAF&#8208;1&#8208;NTM (k1&#160;=&#160;0.025 min&#8722;1) are significantly higher than those of all other porous adsorbents reported to date. These results thus establish PAF&#8208;1&#8208;NTM as a new benchmark for high&#8208;temperature I2 adsorbents. Mechanism investigation reveals a new insight that the I2 adsorption capacity is positively correlated with the pore space utilization rate. Our work not only develops a promising adsorbent for industrial radioactive I2 capture but also establishes a general design principle for creating high&#8208;temperature I2 adsorbents suitable for practical applications.

         <title>Conjugation Engineering Boosts Alkynyl&#8208;Copper Photocatalysis for Efficient Selective Aerobic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel alkynyl copper photocatalysts exhibiting broad light absorption, high charge carrier separation efficiency, and excellent stability were designed and synthesized through a conjugation engineering strategy in phenylacetylide&#8208;copper (PACu). These photocatalysts demonstrated outstanding conversion rates and selectivity during the electron&#8208;mediated oxygen activation process. 








Abstract
Phenylacetylide&#8208;copper (PACu), as an important photoactive intermediate in copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings, suffers from limited visible&#8208;light absorption, rapid radiative recombination, and poor photostability, hindering its practical application. Herein, we report a conjugation engineering strategy to address these challenges by replacing phenylacetylene with extended &#960;&#8208;system ligands, such as 2&#8208;ethynylnaphthalene (NA), 9&#8208;ethynylphenanthrene (FA), and 1&#8208;ethynylpyrene (BA), yielding a series of new alkynyl&#8208;copper photocatalysts (NACu, FACu, BACu). Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation narrows the band gap to 1.95&#160;eV (BACu), extends absorption beyond 600&#160;nm, promotes charge separation, and suppresses CuI oxidation during photocatalysis. The optimized BACu demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic activity and stability in [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition, Glaser coupling, and benzylamine oxidation, achieving&#160;&gt;99% conversion and selectivity with excellent recyclability. This work provides fundamental insights into electronic structure modulation via conjugation engineering, offering a universal strategy for designing efficient and stable metal&#8208;alkynyl photocatalysts.

         <title>Overcoming Copper Instability via Nickel Alloying for Efficient Plasmon&#8208;Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>

         <dc:description>
A stable CuNi bimetallic catalyst (CuNi/Al2O3) was developed for plasmon&#8208;enhanced photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation. Under the irradiation, a remarkable CO production rate of 4813&#160;&#181;mol/g/h is achieved, outperforming most noble metal (Au, Ag)&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts. The synergy between Ni and light markedly lowers the reaction activation energy and furnishes Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts with an metallic valence state throughout the reaction to suppress CO poisoning. This strategy addresses the long&#8208;standing stability bottlenecks of conventional Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts.








Abstract
The development of efficient, stable, and low&#8208;coat plasmonic catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation via the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction remains a significant challenge. Conventional Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts suffer from poor stability due to the valence state fluctuation, nanoparticle sintering, and CO poisoning. Herein, we report a low&#8208;cost CuNi bimetallic plasmonic catalyst (CuNi/Al2O3) that address these bottlenecks, achieving a remarkable CO production rate of 4813&#160;&#181;mol/g/h under light irradiation at a relatively low temperature (300 &#176;C), outperforming conventional Cu&#8208;based and noble metal catalysts. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Ni incorporation enhances catalytic activity and stability by reducing activation energy, maintaining surface valence stability and suppressing nanoparticle sintering. In situ characterization further confirms that light not only drives the CO2 hydrogenation via the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of Cu but also synergizes with Ni to suppress CO poisoning and promote surface reducibility, ensuring long&#8208;term stability. This work provides a rational design strategy for low&#8208;cost, stable Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts and deepens the mechanistic understanding of alloy&#8208;mediated plasmonic CO2 conversion, offering insights for advancing solar&#8208;driven CO2 valorization.

         <title>Tailored Hierarchical Bonding Networks Derive Ultra&#8208;Stable Underwater Adhesion in Harsh Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered with a cross&#8208;linked polysiloxane network enriched with dense interaction sites (hydroxyls, aromatic rings, cations, and hydrophobic groups), the adhesive delivers multiscale synergistic enhancement of both cohesion and interfacial adhesion. It demonstrates robust bonding strength (12.2&#160;MPa in dry conditions and 3.4&#160;MPa underwater), long&#8208;term stability across diverse extreme environments, and strong antibacterial/antifungal activity.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance water&#8208;resistant and underwater adhesives is critical for advancing underwater technologies, yet achieving robust functional adhesion with long&#8208;term durability in complex underwater environments remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a hierarchical bonding network strategy to realize stable adhesion under harsh underwater conditions. By engineering a cross&#8208;linked polysiloxane backbone embedded with dense active interaction sites, including hydroxyl groups, benzene rings, cations, and hydrophobic moieties, we create synergistic multiscale interactions that amplify both cohesion and interfacial adhesion.&#160;The optimized adhesive achieves a strong bonding strength of 12.2&#160;MPa and an underwater adhesion of 3.4&#160;MPa on steel substrates and retains stability in corrosive underwater environments (acidic, alkaline, and saline solutions) over extended periods. It further demonstrates exceptional thermal resilience, maintaining functionality across temperatures from &#8208;196 to 150&#160;&#176;C.&#160;Integrating quaternary ammonium cations with long&#8208;chain alkanes endows the material with potent antibacterial activity (&#8805;99.9999% inhibition) and the highest antifungal grade. This work provides a new avenue for designing high&#8208;performance multifunctional adhesives with strong adhesion, long&#8208;term durability, extreme temperature resistance, and antimicrobial properties, offering broad potential for applications in demanding underwater environments.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Programmed Generation of Coordination, Ionic, and All&#8208;In&#8208;One Cu(I) Chloride Architectures with Highly Efficient Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;programmed synthetic strategy directs ligand protonation and nucleation pathways to produce coordination, ionic, and all&#8208;in&#8208;one Cu(I) chlorides, yielding six new structures with tunable 520&#8211;625 nm emission. Among them, the 1D AIO phase A&#8208;1H[CuCl2] (A = 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)pyridine, 4AMP) exhibits record photoluminescence quantum yield, outstanding stability, and excellent solution processability, enabling rare&#8208;earth&#8208;free, robust solid&#8208;state lighting and high&#8208;brightness emitting devices.








Abstract
Copper(I)&#8208;based hybrid halides feature highly designable structures, systematic tunability, and excellent photoluminescence; however, developing design rules that can predictably modulate their emission across different structural types remains under explored. Here, we report an acid&#8208;programmed generating approach, in which reaction acidity simultaneously modulates ligand protonation and the nucleation barrier, thereby generating coordination, ionic, and all&#8208;in&#8208;one copper(I) chloride architectures by tuning reaction acidity and affording six new compounds with emissions spanning 520&#8211;625&#160;nm. Among these, the AIO compound 3 A&#8208;1H[CuCl2] (A&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;(aminomethyl)pyridine, 4AMP) exhibits a record&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 99%, setting a new benchmark for AIO Cu(I)&#8208;based emitters. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy reveal that the ultrahigh PLQY originates from enhanced lattice rigidity and a triplet phosphorescence pathway. Solubility and thin film fabrication demonstrate excellent processability, while long&#8208;term stability stands in stark contrast to the notorious instability of conventional Cu(I) halides. Moreover, mixing compounds yields broad&#8208;range white&#8208;light emission, underscoring the potential of materials for tunable and high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state lighting. This study establishes acid&#8208;driven structural integration as a general strategy for constructing functional copper(I) halide compounds, laying the foundation for stable, solution&#8208;processable, and high&#8208;performance optoelectronic materials.

         <title>The Coordination Microenvironment Tailoring in 2D MOFs for Enhancing Photocatalytic Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 2D MOFs with different cobalt coordination environments were synthesized to study the influence of catalytic microenvironment of cobalt on photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation (PAH). The results showed O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208;coordinated Co sites showed enormous variation on PAH, and the mechanisms were confirmed by in situ FTIR and DFT calculations.








Abstract
The semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene (C2H2) to ethylene (C2H4) by photocatalytic is a new and clean strategy for removal of C2H2 impurities from raw C2H4 to produce polymer&#8208;grade C2H4. In the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, most of the studies on photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation (PAH) were achieved by cobalt&#8208;based photocatalysts, while the studies on the influence of microenvironment of cobalt catalytic active sites remain limited. Herein, via coordination ligand modulation method, we chose three 2D metal organic framework (2D MOFs) with different coordinated atoms (N, O, and S) around cobalt center and afforded CoN4 MOF, CoO4 MOF, and CoS4 MOF, respectively, for studying the influence of coordination environment of cobalt active sites on photocatalytic C2H2 reduction. As a result, CoO4 MOF with O&#8208;coordinated cobalt sites exhibited the highest activity with C2H2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 yield of 852.68&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in C2H2 atmosphere. Interestingly, in simulated industry&#8208;relevant conditions gas with 1% C2H2 contained C2H4 mixture, CoN4 MOF showed the optimal performance with near 100% conversion of low&#8208;concentrated C2H2. The photophysical, C2H2 adsorption characterization, in situ FTIR, and density functional theory (DFT) calculation were conducted to investigate the reaction mechanism. The results demonstrated that the O&#8208;coordinated Co sites behaved more favorably thermodynamically for *C2H2&#8208;to&#8208;*CH2CH intermediate, which caused superior activity. In contrast, the N&#8208;coordinated Co sites showed highly efficient PAH in C2H4 rich conditions with low concentrated C2H2 due to the weak C2H4 competitive adsorption. This work is the first to explore the dependence of the active site coordination microenvironment for C2H2 photoreduction and provides a platform for constructing highly selective photocatalysts.

In contrast, the N-coordinated Co sites showed highly efficient PAH in C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; rich conditions with low concentrated C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; due to the weak C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; competitive adsorption. This work is the first to explore the dependence of the active site coordination microenvironment for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction and provides a platform for constructing highly selective photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Machine Learning&#8211;Guided Solvation Engineering of Chiral Viologens for Durable Neutral Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers the use of machine learning&#8208;engineered chiral viologens to overcome solubility limitations and enhance alkaline resilience through solvation effects. It demonstrates the successful kg&#8208;scale preparation and Ah&#8208;class stack validation of chiral viologens for neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) during long&#8208;term energy storage.








Abstract
Conventional N&#8208;alkylated viologen electrolytes in neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) undergo irreversible nucleophilic SN2 dealkylation degradation. Moreover, trial&#8208;and&#8208;error molecular design often fails to resolve the solubility&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off in high&#8208;concentration systems. Here we report a machine learning (ML) strategy using large language models (LLMs) trained on over 1300 AORFB studies to predict chiral viologens with ortho&#8208;dihydroxy motifs. This bonding network forms a dynamic, pH&#8208;adaptive &#8220;solvation armor&#8221; that stabilizes the viologen structure. The R&#8208;/S&#8208;enantiomers (2.75/2.76&#160;M) exhibit 1.66 times higher solubility versus RS&#8208;racemate. Molecular simulations and in situ spectroscopy confirm that the dihydroxy groups protect reactive C&#9472;N bonds via a solvation structure (unrelated to chiral effect), enhancing stability to pH 11. The 1&#160;M R2+/R+&#8226; redox couple sets a new record by achieving 99.42% capacity retention over 3652 cycles. The 1&#160;M R&#8208;based AORFB shows 100% retention over 533 cycles, outperforming quaternary ammonium&#8208; ([(NPr)2&#160;V]Cl4, 94.92%) and sulfonate&#8208;modified viologen ((SPr)2&#160;V), 65.49%). Stable cycling across 0.1 &#8764; 2.5&#160;M demonstrates decoupling of degradation from concentration. This strategy is validated by 2.5&#160;kg&#8208;scale synthesis and Ah&#8208;class stack testing (98.65% retention over 77 cycles), demonstrating industrial scalability. This work establishes a generalizable, ML&#8208;enabled platform for electrolyte development, bridging molecular design and practical AORFB deployment.

         <title>Non&#8208;Statistical Assembly of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cages for Light&#8208;Induced Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8211;acceptor functionalized cages [Pd2D2A2]4+ with defined stoichiometry and stereoconfiguration were assembled in a single step by employing the shape complementary assembly (SCA) strategy. While the redox functionalities remain largely independent in the ground state, photoexcitation results in ultrafast ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer, as unraveled by spectro&#8208;electrochemistry and transient absorption spectroscopy.








Abstract
We report light&#8208;triggered charge separation in two discrete supramolecular architectures that self&#8208;assemble in a single step from donor (D) and acceptor (A) functionalized bridging ligands and Pd(II) cations. The &#8220;shape complementary assembly&#8221; (SCA) strategy allows for exclusive formation of the cis&#8208;[Pd2D2A2]4+ cage isomer. Compared to previously reported statistical DA assemblies, lacking stoichiometry and stereo control, the number of possible electron transfer routes was reduced. This enables a better understanding and tunability of the excited state dynamics. Cage assembly was investigated by NMR, MS, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Steady&#8208;state absorption and electrochemical properties indicate that donor and acceptor moieties remain largely independent in the electronic ground state. Femtosecond pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy in the visible and infrared was applied to compare the fate of photoexcited states for pure ligands, donor&#8208; and acceptor&#8208;only assemblies, and the donor&#8211;acceptor heteroleptic cages. For the latter, ultrafast intracage ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge separation is followed by two back electron transfer pathways, occurring on timescales of hundreds of picoseconds and around one nanosecond, assignable to D/A ligands facing each other in cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;position. Our work shows that non&#8208;statistical modular self&#8208;assembly can be used for the precise positioning of photoredox&#8208;active components in defined distances on the nanoscale.

         <title>Facet&#8208;Dependent Solid Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Co3O4 Catalysts Towards Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation Reaction of Alkynols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co3O4 nanorod (Co3O4&#8211;NR) catalyst with abundant solid&#8208;frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs) exhibits exceptional performance towards semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of alkynols, which is superior to non&#8208;precious metal catalysts and even comparable to noble metal ones.








Abstract
The semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynols to enols represents a vital industrial reaction for fine chemical synthesis, yet developing highly selective non&#8208;noble metal catalysts remains an urgent challenge. Herein, we report a Co3O4 nanorod (Co3O4&#8208;NR) catalyst with abundant solid&#8208;frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs) on specifically exposed {110} facets, where coordinatively unsaturated Co2+ acts as Lewis acid site whilst the surface hydroxyl group serves as Lewis base site. The Co3O4&#8208;NR catalyst exhibits exceptional performance toward semi&#8208;hydrogenation from 3&#8208;butyn&#8208;1&#8208;ol to 3&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ol with a product yield of 88.2%, which is preponderate to other non&#8208;noble metal catalysts. Poisoning experiments, in situ DRIFTS and theoretical calculations verify that the SFLPs sites serve as intrinsic active centers for H2 activation/dissociation and substrate adsorption. The hydrogenation of key intermediate (C4H7O*) is identified as the rate&#8208;determining step, where H&#948;+ species strongly tethered to surface&#160;&#8722;OH group suppresses over&#8208;hydrogenation and thereby enhances the semi&#8208;hydrogenation selectivity. Projected density of states (PDOS) analysis reveals an accelerated hydrogenation kinetics via d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between Co 3d orbitals and C 2p orbitals in C4H7O*. This work advances the design of efficient and cost&#8208;effective SFLPs&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts, which shows potential application in the synthesis of fine chemicals.

A proton&#8208;conducting ionomer regulates the reaction microenvironment by increasing the local CO2 concentration around a catalyst particle, resulting in a record CO partial current density of 410&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 3.09&#160;V. The impressive bicarbonate electrolysis performance enables a promising bicarbonate&#8208;mediated integrated CO2 capture and electrolysis process.








Abstract
Bicarbonate electrolysis coupling upstream CO2 capture with electrochemical conversion of captured CO2 presents an energy&#8208;efficient alternative to existing CO2 electrolysis route. Yet, its practical application is impeded by unsatisfactory reaction rate and energy efficiency. Here, we have improved the bicarbonate electrolysis performance through manipulating reaction microenvironments by introducing ionomers into cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) electrodes. The Nafion&#8208;incorporated CoPc electrode exhibits a maximum CO partial current density of 410&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 3.09&#160;V in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer. Electrode structure characterization and finite element simulation results indicate that the proton conductivity of the Nafion ionomer increases the local concentration of in situ generated CO2 around CoPc catalyst, resulting in impressive CO production performance. A closed&#8208;loop demonstration using the Nafion&#8208;incorporated CoPc electrode and a simulated flue gas underscores the great promise of the bicarbonate&#8208;mediated integrated CO2 capture and electrolysis process.

         <title>Heterojunction Mediated Interfacial Selenium Vacancy Facilitating Spontaneous N&#9552;O Bonds Breakage Toward Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial selenium vacancy was constructed by selenide heterojunction. The VSe could induce enhanced nitrate adsorption and spontaneous N&#9552;O bonds breakage. Ni3Se4/CoSe2 heterojunction nanosheets array delivered excellent performance in NO3RR and zinc&#8211;nitrate battery.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrates reduction reaction driven by green electricity provides a feasible pathway for simultaneously achieving the elimination of nitrates pollutants and production of valuable ammonia. However, the electrocatalytic efficiency is limited by the low ammonia yield rate and Faradaic efficiency. Vacancy engineering is an efficient strategy for improving the performance of catalysts. Here, we develop an efficient strategy of heterojunction (Ni3Se4/CoSe2) mediated interfacial selenium vacancy toward efficient ammonia electrosynthesis. In situ characterizations combined with theoretical calculations reveal that the interfacial selenium vacancy on CoSe2 segment strengthens the adsorption of nitrates, spontaneously breaks the N&#9552;O bonds of nitrates, thereby accelerating the overall NO3RR. The Ni3Se4/CoSe2 heterojunction nanosheets array achieves an ammonia yield of 1.44&#160;mmol cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiency of 94.8% at a current density of 350&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the Ni3Se4/CoSe2 heterojunction electrode was assembled into a zinc&#8211;nitrate battery as the cathode, delivering an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.46&#160;V, a maximum power density of 12.71&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, and a charge&#8211;discharge stability of over 168&#160;h.

         <title>Ga&#8208;Induced Reversal of Pd Electronic States in ZrO2&#8208;Supported Pd2Ga1 Nanoparticles for Enhanced Ethanol Electrooxidation via the C1 Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>

Ga&#8208;induced electronic redistribution reverses the Pd electronic states, endowing the catalyst with outstanding EOR activity and durability as well as high selectivity toward the C1 pathway.








Abstract
Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) are recognized as a promising energy conversion technology due to their high energy density and the renewable, eco&#8208;friendly nature of ethanol. However, their commercialization is hindered by the lack of anode catalysts that simultaneously offer high activity, stability, and selectivity toward the C1 pathway in the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). Herein, we report a rationally designed Pd2Ga1&#8208;ZrO2@NC electrocatalyst, in which Pd2Ga1 alloy nanoparticles are anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;encapsulated ZrO2 nanoframework. In alkaline media, this catalyst exhibits exceptional EOR performance, achieving a remarkable mass activity of 27.3 A mgPd&#8722;1, 3.6 and 21.8 times higher than those of Pd&#8208;ZrO2@NC and commercial Pd/C, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrates a high C1 pathway selectivity of 58.7% at 0.8 VRHE&#160;and retains 48.9% of its initial activity after 2000 accelerated durability test cycles, significantly outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benchmarks. Combined experimental and DFT studies reveal the crucial function of Ga as an electron donor, which reverses the electron transfer around Pd from outward (in Pd&#8208;ZrO2@NC) to inward (in Pd2Ga1&#8208;ZrO2@NC), creating an electron&#8208;rich Pd state. This electronic restructuring thereby lowers the *CO oxidation barrier, strengthens *OH adsorption, and enhances metal&#8208;support interaction, collectively boosting both the C1 pathway selectivity and the overall EOR performance. This work provides valuable insights for the design of high&#8208;performance alloy&#8208;oxide composite electrocatalysts.

         <title>Anthracene Bisurea as a Supramolecular Chloride Receptor for Additive&#8208;Free, Broad&#8208;Scope Gold(I) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold(I) chloride complexes are excellent precatalysts to activate unsaturated C&#9472;C bonds but typically require problematic silver salts for chloride scavenging. A supramolecular chloride receptor embedded in a phosphine ligand removes the need for inorganic chloride scavengers. Detailed mechanistic studies explain the key role of the quintuple H&#8208;bond donor motif in cleaving the Au&#9472;Cl bond to promote fast, broad&#8208;scope, additive&#8208;free catalysis.








Abstract
Gold catalysis provides access to a remarkable array of complex carbon scaffolds, but the use of silver salts to activate gold(I) chloride precatalysts can be problematic due to Ag(I) light sensitivity, hygroscopicity, redox activity, and interference with the desired catalysis. Although H&#8208;bond donors are a promising alternative to silver salts, they still suffer from much lower activity and narrower applicability, as Au&#8211;Cl cleavage remains rate limiting. To address these limitations, we have rationally designed a self&#8208;activating phosphine Au(I) chloride complex that incorporates a supramolecular chloride receptor in the form of an anthracene bisurea quintuple H&#8208;bond donor. In the absence of any additive, this complex promotes multiple intra&#8208; and intermolecular reactions, with a catalytic activity rivalling traditional inorganic chloride scavengers. Mechanistic studies for the model reaction show that the exceptional chloride binding ability of the anthracene bisurea unlocks access to a zwitterionic catalyst resting state where the Au&#9472;Cl bond has been cleaved, thus significantly reducing barriers for catalysis. The principles uncovered in this work show how supramolecular anion recognition moieties impact catalyst speciation and enhance performance, enabling for the first time H&#8208;bond donors to compete with inorganic chloride scavengers in terms of activity and generality.

         <title>Sensitized Disequilibration of Water&#8208;Soluble Azopolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disequilibration by sensitization under confinement (DESC) is a promising strategy for efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced azobenzene E&#8594;Z isomerization. In this article, we explored key factors for adapting DESC to azopolymers, eventually achieving efficiencies up to 85% compared to direct excitation and laying the foundation for more complex systems.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;responsive systems based on azobenzenes usually require UV light for E&#8594;Z isomerization, limiting their applicability, especially in biomedical contexts. Disequilibration by sensitization of azobenzene under confinement (DESC) has recently emerged as a supramolecular strategy to bypass this limitation without the need to derivatize the azobenzene scaffold. Here, we expand DESC to water&#8208;soluble azopolymers obtained by RAFT polymerization and systematically investigate the interplay between the polymer structure and DESC efficiency. Using this approach, we achieved as much as 85% of the direct photoexcitation (UV) switching efficiency, while utilizing low&#8208;energy (yellow) light. These results establish general design principles for combining DESC with polymeric systems, opening new opportunities for the development of functional materials driven with low&#8208;energy light.

     alt="Sensitized Disequilibration of Water-Soluble Azopolymers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disequilibration by sensitization under confinement (DESC) is a promising strategy for efficient visible-light-induced azobenzene &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8594;&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; isomerization. In this article, we explored key factors for adapting DESC to azopolymers, eventually achieving efficiencies up to 85% compared to direct excitation and laying the foundation for more complex systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photo-responsive systems based on azobenzenes usually require UV light for &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8594;&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; isomerization, limiting their applicability, especially in biomedical contexts. Disequilibration by sensitization of azobenzene under confinement (DESC) has recently emerged as a supramolecular strategy to bypass this limitation without the need to derivatize the azobenzene scaffold. Here, we expand DESC to water-soluble azopolymers obtained by RAFT polymerization and systematically investigate the interplay between the polymer structure and DESC efficiency. Using this approach, we achieved as much as 85% of the direct photoexcitation (UV) switching efficiency, while utilizing low-energy (yellow) light. These results establish general design principles for combining DESC with polymeric systems, opening new opportunities for the development of functional materials driven with low-energy light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Energy Level Engineering of Dihydrophenazine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks Through &#960;&#8208;Expansion of Cores Toward Tandem Photocatalytic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several kinds of 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different &#960;&#8208;extended dihydrophenazine cores were designed and synthesized. These COFs can serve as efficient and recyclable tandem photocatalysts toward two polymerization reactions through energy&#8208;level engineering.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating photoredox&#8208;active motifs show great promise as heterogeneous catalysts, yet their applications have been largely confined to one&#8208;step transformations. In this work, we design and synthesize a series of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) COFs with different &#960;&#8208;extended dihydrophenazine cores to achieve superior photocatalytic performance. These 3D COFs exhibit excellent crystallinity, high surface areas, and remarkable chemical stability. More importantly, they can work as highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for photocatalytic tandem polymerization reactions using styrene and fluoroalkyl anhydrides as substrates, yielding fluoroalkylated polystyrene polymers with narrow dispersity. These COFs constitute the first examples as tandem photocatalysts toward polymerization reactions. Moreover, optimal energy level alignment and enhanced photophysical properties are identified as key factors contributing to their high efficacy. This work not only provides a viable design strategy for multifunctional COF catalysts, but also expands their utility in complex synthetic sequences involving tandem catalytic processes.

         <title>Photosynthesis of Urea by Cooperative Radicals Addition Using a Peptide as a Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a cooperative radical addition pathway for efficient urea synthesis catalyzed by a bio&#8208;inspired proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) photocatalyst via a tandem PCET process.








Abstract
Innovative strategies for efficient photocatalytic urea production are desirable due to the wide applications of urea and derivatives in agriculture and pharmaceuticals, which remain highly challenging. Here, we introduce a simple but efficient radical addition approach to address this challenge by fully utilizing the in situ, synchronously generated aminyl radical (&#183;NH2) and hydroperoxyl radical (HO2&#183;) via the coupling of photocatalytic NH3 oxidation and O2 reduction. The two radicals reassembled and cooperatively reacted with NH2COOH to form urea with markedly lower kinetic barrier than the industrial process. This approach not only achieved record&#8208;high urea production and conversion rates (42.6&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and 70%, respectively) but also enabled the direct, single&#8208;step synthesis of unsymmetrical urea derivatives with good yields.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of All&#8208;Carbon Tetrasubstituted Alkenes Enabled by van der Waals Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the first successful nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of sterically congested all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, achieving broad substrate scope (37 examples) with high efficiency (up to 99% yield, &gt;99% ee, and TON up to 500). Combined experimental and computational studies reveal that van der Waals interactions play a pivotal role in governing enantioselectivity. This strategy further enables concise asymmetric syntheses of pharmaceutically relevant compounds, including Valerate and Esfenvalerate.








Abstract
The asymmetric hydrogenation of all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes has long posed a significant challenge due to their pronounced steric hindrance. Conventional approaches typically rely on precious metal catalysts. Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. The developed catalytic system exhibits a broad substrate scope, delivering excellent reactivity and enantioselectivity across 37 examples (up to 99% yield, &gt;99% ee, and TON up to 500). Combined experimental and computational studies reveal that van der Waals interactions play a pivotal role in governing enantioselectivity. This strategy further enables concise asymmetric syntheses of pharmaceutically relevant compounds, including Valerate and Esfenvalerate.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis and Antigenicity Evaluation of an O&#8208;Antigen Octadecasaccharide from Helicobacter pylori</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic total synthesis of the H. pylori SS1 O&#8208;antigen octadecasaccharide was achieved by stereoconvergent [6&#160;+&#160;4] assembly and protecting&#8208;group&#8208;controlled enzymatic site&#8208;specific fucosylation. Glycan microarray screening of the synthetic O&#8208;antigen and its fragments identified a simpler antigenic epitope, providing a key target for glycoconjugate vaccine design.








Abstract
Helicobacter pylori infection represents a major global health challenge, characterized by high prevalence, significant association with gastric cancer, and rising antibiotic resistance. Carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccines targeting the O&#8208;antigen of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) present a promising alternative to conventional antimicrobial therapies. To explore the immunogenicity of LPS O&#8208;antigen from clinical isolate H. pylori SS1, we report an integrated chemoenzymatic strategy for the first synthesis of its octadecasaccharide O&#8208;antigen and related fragments for antigenicity evaluation. Our strategy features modular chemical synthesis of a decasaccharide precursor containing a high&#8208;carbon sugar (D,D&#8208;Hep) residue, a unique oligomeric &#946;1,2&#8208;linked ribofuranosyl tetrasaccharide motif and a switchable glucosamine (GlcNH2) residue through stereoconvergent [6&#160;+&#160;4] assembly, followed by protecting&#8208;group&#8208;controlled enzymatic elongation to precisely install hybrid Lewis antigen moiety (Ley&#8208;Lex) in a site&#8208;specific fucosylation manner to afford the target octadecasaccharide bearing five challenging 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages. Chemical stereoselective construction of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glucosidic and 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;fucosidic linkages was accomplished by reagent&#8208;controlled glycosylation and 4&#8208;O&#8208;acyl remote participation, respectively. Enzymatic site&#8208;specific installation of the remaining three 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;fucosidic linkages was achieved using two robust fucosyltransferases and a strategically designed GlcNH2 residue. Glycan microarray&#8208;based screening of the synthetic O&#8208;antigen and its subunits with H. pylori&#8208;infected patient sera identified an undecasaccharide as a simpler and key epitope for vaccine development.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Biohybrid Upcycling of Polylactic Acid Plastics to Alanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;photosynthesis hybrid system that integrates enzymatic PLA depolymerization and photocatalytic LA upgrading was constructed, which enables the PLA waste transformed into alanine under ambient conditions with a considerable yield rate of 61.91&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Upcycling of waste plastics into commodity chemicals such as amino acids represents a promising route toward achieving negative carbon emissions and enabling a circular carbon economy. However, existing thermocatalytic methods typically require harsh conditions. While photocatalytic upcycling operates under mild conditions, its dependence on a high&#8208;temperature hydrolysis step for plastic pretreatment undermines its overall practicality. Here we report a bio&#8208;photocatalytic hybrid system that converts polylactic acid (PLA) plastics into alanine under ambient conditions. The integrated system begins with enzymatic depolymerization of PLA to lactic acid (LA) with 92% conversion at 55&#176;C and pH 10, catalyzed by an engineered peptidase derived from the Micromonospora sp. strain. Without any purification, the resulting hydrolysate is fed directly to the photosynthesis system, where the LA monomers are converted to alanine over a Ni/ZnIn2S4 catalyst using ammonia as a nitrogen source. This photocatalytic process, which proceeds via an oxygen&#8208;centered radical intermediate pathway, achieves an alanine production rate of 61.91&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and an overall yield of 60%. Life cycle assessment demonstrates that our tandem bio&#8208;photoconversion system substantially reduces the carbon footprint compared to single&#8208;step thermocatalytic and photocatalytic systems. This work thus establishes a sustainable route for valued chemicals production from low&#8208;cost feedstocks.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Conjugated &#960;&#8211;&#963;&#8211;&#960; Architectures Enable Single&#8208;Molecule Insulators via Destructive Quantum Interference</title>

This work provides a model system for studying destructive quantum interference in single&#8208;molecule junctions based on &#960;&#8211;&#963;&#8211;&#960; architectures. By comparing DM and SF molecules with site&#8208;specific substitutions, we delineate linear versus spiro&#8208;conjugation traits and the role of positional effects, offering a framework for the rational design of functional molecular devices.








Abstract
Controlling molecular conductance beyond highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO&#8211;LUMO) interference is essential for advancing single&#8208;molecule electronics. Here we employ &#960;&#8211;&#963;&#8211;&#960; frameworks&#8212;linear diphenylmethane and orthogonal 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene&#8212;to investigate destructive quantum interference (DQI) governed by orbitals on the same side. Four model molecules (DM22&#8208;MT, DM44&#8208;MT, SF33&#8208;MT, SF44&#8208;MT) were designed with site&#8208;specific &#8211;SMe anchoring groups and examined by scanning tunneling microscope&#8211;break junction (STM&#8211;BJ) measurements and theoretical simulations. All exhibit intrinsically low conductance, consistent with destructive quantum interference (DQI) effect. Importantly, site&#8208;dependent effects in spiro systems disrupt spiro&#8208;conjugation and alter anchor&#8211;electrode coupling, leading to counterintuitive conductance trends. This study provides the first experimental evidence for bilateral DQI in &#960;&#8211;&#963;&#8211;&#960; systems and establishes a molecular design strategy for insulating and functionalized single&#8208;molecule devices.

         <title>A High&#8208;Entropy Hydrogel Electrolyte Generated by Intrinsically Disordered Polymer Segments for Efficient Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept high&#8208;entropy hydrogel electrolyte was demonstrated to enable the formation of entropically stabilized ion transport pathways, minimize water reactivity, and diminish contact ion pairing, thereby circumventing the long&#8208;lasting trade&#8208;off between high ion conduction and good electrochemical stability in hydrogel electrolytes.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes hold promise in enabling aqueous zinc metal batteries (ZMBs) as a sustainable energy storage technology, but they still suffer from the trade&#8208;off between high ion conduction and electrochemical stability. High&#8208;entropy engineering strategies are powerful in unlocking new regimes in energy storage, yet this paradigm has rarely been reported in hydrogel electrolytes. Herein, we report a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept high&#8208;entropy hydrogel electrolyte (HEHE) that integrates three ionic monomers to maximize compositional diversity and entropic stabilization. Multimodal experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations reveal that the HEHE can promote the formation of entropically stabilized ion transport pathways, and minimize water reactivity and contact ion pairing, thereby enabling selective cation conduction, uniform ionic flux, low&#8208;energy interfacial desolvation, and crystallographic zinc deposition. The resulting HEHE circumvents the aforementioned dilemma, achieving essential electrochemical properties far exceeding those of the low&#8208;entropy counterpart, while enabling full ZMBs to work stably at a practically high areal capacity of 3.2 mAh cm&#8722;2. Such a HEHE uniquely orchestrates four entropy contributions within the gel matrix, and the applicability of this strategy is corroborated in parallel hydrogel electrolytes. This work establishes entropy&#8208;driven design as a generalizable approach for soft ion conductors, expanding the scope of high&#8208;entropy materials into aqueous batteries and beyond.

         <title>Constructing Hydrogen Migration Channel from Atomic Clusters to Single Atom for Superior Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Ultralow Pt Loading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a breakthrough in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysis via a &#8220;reaction decoupling&#8221; strategy. A dual&#8208;active&#8208;site architecture with PtMn atomic clusters and neighboring Pt single atoms on S&#8208;doped carbon is engineered. This design spatially separates H* generation (on PtMn atomic clusters) from H* recombination/desorption (on Pt single atoms), enabling independent step optimization and overcoming the Sabatier limitation of single&#8208;site catalysts.








Abstract
Developing highly active and durable cathode catalysts using minimal use of noble metal remains a grand challenge for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Herein we design a Pt&#8208;based sub&#8208;nanometric catalysts featuring coexisting single atoms and atomic clusters anchored on sulfur&#8208;doped carbon. This dual&#8208;active&#8208;site architecture enables independent optimization of active hydrogen (H*) formation and subsequent recombination kinetics, thus breaking the limitation of Sabatier principle. Specially, by introducing a secondary transition metal such as Mn, the interfacial charge distribution and work function of Pt clusters is regulated, promoting both H* formation and migration. Meanwhile, the neighboring electron&#8208;deficient Pt single atoms facilitate H* recombination kinetics. The catalyst with 3.6 wt% Pt loading achieves a recorded mass activity of 14.48 A mg&#8722;1 at 15&#160;mV, exceeding commercial 40wt% Pt/C by 41&#8208;fold. When integrated into an electrolyzer, the catalyst demonstrates exceptional activity and stability with only 10% Pt loading relative to commercial benchmark, representing a critical advancement toward practical green hydrogen production. Also, the direct evidences of H* formation, migration and recombination process are confirmed by operando experiments and theoretical calculations for the first time, which offers new concept for decoupling of HER reaction and rational design of catalysts.

         <title>Laser Irradiation Induced Ru Cluster&#8208;Based Catalysts with Dual Spillover Pathways for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective laser irradiation strategy has been proposed and demonstrated for constructing Ru clusters on oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich Co(OH)x with dual spillover pathways for intermediates of hydrogen evolution reaction. The as&#8208;obtained catalyst therefore delivers excellent performance for this reaction.








Abstract
Ru cluster&#8208;based electrocatalysts are promising for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

&lt;p&gt;An effective laser irradiation strategy has been proposed and demonstrated for constructing Ru clusters on oxygen vacancy-rich Co(OH)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; with dual spillover pathways for intermediates of hydrogen evolution reaction. The as-obtained catalyst therefore delivers excellent performance for this reaction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ru cluster-based electrocatalysts are promising for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the strong adsorption of H* and OH* intermediates during water dissociation on these clusters severely hampers subsequent gas evolution. Herein, we report a rational design of Co(OH)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-supported Ru clusters (L-Ru/Co(OH)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) through laser irradiation featuring dual spillover pathways for H* and OH*. The laser irradiation induces a localized thermal effect with fast heating and quenching, which simultaneously generates uniformly dispersed oxygen vacancies (OVs) on Co(OH)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; nanosheets and forms ultrafine Ru clusters that are directly anchored at the OVs. The L-Ru/Co(OH)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; enables a synergistic electron redistribution among Ru clusters, OVs, and the adjacent Co sites, yielding electron-rich Ru and Co sites along with electron-deficient OVs. Such electron modulation facilitates spillover of H* and OH* on the Ru clusters to the adjacent electron-rich Co sites and OVs, respectively, promoting continuous hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Realizing Phase&#8208;Matching of Nonlinear Optical [ABa3Br2][Ga5Se10] (A&#160;=&#160;Cs, Rb, K, Na) Through Large Anisotropic Lattice Distortion</title>

         <dc:description>
The increase in birefringence stems from the large anisotropic lattice distortion and directly promotes phase matching ability in nonlinear optical crystals [ABa3Br2][Ga5Se10] (A&#160;=&#160;Cs, Rb, K, Na). 








Abstract
Achieving phase&#8208;matching (PM) behavior by enhancing the birefringence of nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals has been a formidable challenge. Herein, salt&#8208;inclusion chalcogenides [ABa3Br2][Ga5Se10] (A&#160;=&#160;Cs, 1; Rb, 2; K, 3; Na, 4) that crystal in tetragonal system were synthesized and exhibit smaller c/a ratios (where a and c are the lattice constants) when compared with their Cl&#8208;analogues, indicative of an anisotropic lattice distortion. Along the a&#8208; and c&#8208;axes, the refractive indices show a significant divergence, corresponding to the decrease or increase in electron density. Such anisotropic behavior significantly enhances the birefringence of compounds 1&#8211;4 (0.044&#8211;0.066 @546&#160;nm), realizing the transition from non&#8208;PM (Cl&#8208;analogues) to PM (compounds 1&#8211;4) characteristics at near 2.0&#160;um laser. Moreover, compounds 1&#8211;4 represent a rare class of selenides that combine significant PM second&#8208;harmonic generation responses (&gt;1.0&#160;&#215;&#160;AgGaS2) with wide optical band gaps (&gt;3.0&#160;eV). This work achieves the critical transition from non&#8208;PM to PM behavior through significant anisotropic lattice distortion, thereby offering a new avenue for developing NLO materials.

         <title>An Energetic S0/S+ Redox Chemistry for Aqueous and Nonaqueous Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed S0/S+ redox chemistry exhibits distinct advantages over the traditional S0/S2&#8722; couple in both nonaqueous and aqueous batteries. Its intrinsically high electrode potential and high conversion efficiency enable the construction of high&#8211;energy density sulfur batteries, while simultaneously avoiding polysulfide shuttling and the sluggish reaction kinetics that typically limit S0/S2&#8722; systems.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sulfur&#8208;based batteries are primarily driven by the S0/S2&#8722; redox chemistry, yet their performance is limited by sluggish kinetics and low practical energy densities. In aqueous systems, slow solid&#8208;solid conversion leads to high overpotentials (&#8764;1&#160;V) that restricts energy efficiency, while in nonaqueous systems, the sophisticated dissolution&#8208;precipitation mechanism involving soluble polysulfide intermediates induces shuttle effects and capacity loss, necessitating catholyte configurations that compromise energy density. Here, we report an energetic and reversible S0/S+ redox couple enabled by the formation of liquid&#8208;phase S2Br2 in both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes. Compared to traditional S0/S2&#8722; reactions (0.45&#160;V vs. Zn2+/Zn; 2.2&#160;V vs. Li+/Li), the S0/S+ redox chemistry offers significantly higher equilibrium redox potentials (1.68&#160;V vs. Zn2+/Zn; 3.4&#160;V vs. Li+/Li), a direct one&#8208;step conversion pathway that avoids polysulfide intermediates formation, and intrinsically faster kinetics attributed to its solid&#8208;liquid transition nature, enabling full sulfur utilization with a capacity of 837&#160;mAh g&#8722;1. When paired with Zn or Li anodes in tailored aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively, this chemistry delivers high energy densities of 1406 and 2689&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on sulfur mass (402 and 768&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on S2Br2 mass) and demonstrating strong potential for high&#8208;performance batteries.

         <title>Catalytic 1,2&#8208; and 1,1&#8208;Carbocyclization of Alkenes Employing Adamantanols as Tertiary Carbocation Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work addresses the challenge of utilizing tertiary carbocations in catalytic electrophilic cyclization. A Br&#248;nsted acid system facilitates efficient 1,2&#8208; or formal 1,1&#8208;addition of adamantyl cations to various alkenes, yielding adamantylated heterocycles with high selectivity. DFT calculations indicate that the stabilized, moderate electrophilicity of the adamantyl cation and the effect of the nucleophilic tether are key to the success.








Abstract
Catalytic alkene cyclization initiated by carbon electrophiles represents an emerging strategy for constructing valuable and challenging molecular architectures. However, due to reactivity issues, the realization of such reactions with tertiary carbon electrophiles remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report an efficient Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed system that overcomes this limitation. Using 1&#8208;adamantanols as precursors of tertiary carbocation electrophiles, and through TfOH catalysis, alkenes tethered with carboxyl, sulfonamide, and hydroxyl groups, including those with relatively low reactivity such as alkyl&#8208;substituted and terminal alkenes, can be converted into a variety of adamantylated heterocycles in hexafluoroisopropanol with good yields via 1,2&#8208;addition or formal 1,1&#8208;addition, with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The products serve as versatile synthetic building blocks and can be readily transformed into valuable adamantyl&#8208;containing compounds, including derivatives with anti&#8208;influenza A activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments indicate that the moderate electrophilicity of the adamantyl carbocation and the hyperconjugative effect of the adamantyl group in stabilizing carbocations form the basis for achieving the electrophilic cyclization. Additionally, they also reveal that different nucleophilic groups can influence the progression of the reaction. These findings provide references for the design of new electrophilic reactions.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Enabled Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Site&#8208;Selective Cycloaddition of Unprotected Oximes with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient intermolecular cyclization of unprotected oximes with alkenes was achieved by dual photo&#8208; and copper catalysis. This protocol avoids oxygen&#8208;activating reagents and suppresses side reactions of free oximes, enabling streamlined synthesis of 1&#8208;pyrroline scaffolds with water as the by&#8208;product. Key to the method is energy&#8208;transfer photosensitization of a copper&#8208;oxime complex, inducing net oxidative addition of the N&#9472;OH bond to copper.








Abstract
While methodologies for N&#9472;O bond scission in O&#8208;functionalized oximes are well established, the analogous activation of free oximes remains challenging, largely due to the formidable hurdles associated with selective N&#9472;O bond cleavage and competing side reactions involving the acidic O&#9472;H moiety. Herein, we report a dual photo&#8208; and copper&#8208;catalyzed strategy that directly promotes homolytic cleavage of the N&#9472;O bond in free oximes through photosensitization of oxime&#8208;ligated copper complexes, thereby overcoming prior limitations. Mechanistic studies, including full characterization of key copper intermediates, support an energy transfer (EnT) pathway. This distinctive activation mode enables a previously elusive intermolecular cyclization between unprotected oximes and alkenes, delivering valuable 1&#8208;pyrrolines with high efficiency.

         <title>Surface Hydroxyl Network Promoted Hydrogen Transfer Dynamics for Efficient Photocatalytic Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism is realized in photocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation by establishing a hydroxyl network over the hydroxyl&#8208;modified carbon nitride (C3N4&#8208;OH)/Ni(OH)2 composite. The hydroxyl network provides a strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding microenvironment to adsorb interfacial water and accelerate hydrogen transfer dynamics.








Abstract
Photocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene (C2H2) to ethylene (C2H4) is seriously limited by the inefficient generation and directional transfer of active hydrogen species. Here, we report a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism for photocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation by establishing a hydroxyl network over hydroxyl&#8208;modified carbon nitride (C3N4&#8208;OH)/Ni(OH)2 composite. Such a hydroxyl network not only enhances photogenerated charge separation but also establishes a strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding microenvironment for adsorbing interfacial water and facilitating hydrogen transfer dynamics. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy, in situ photochemical infrared spectroscopy, kinetic isotope effect (KIE), and active hydrogen (H*)&#8208;trapping reveal that the fast proton transfer via a PCET mechanism, rather than a conventional hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) pathway. Eventually, the C3N4&#8208;Ni(OH)2 achieves an exceptionally high C2H4 production rate of 15.7&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a C2H4 selectivity of 98.2% under simulated solar irradiation. For purifying a crude C2H4 stream containing 0.5&#160;vol% C2H2, the C2H2 conversion remains &#8764;98% over a long&#8208;term continuous&#8208;flow operation. This work elucidates the pivotal role of surface hydroxyl networks in governing hydrogen kinetics and paves a new avenue for the design of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Decoupling Adsorption of Key Intermediates Enabled by Asymmetric 3d&#8208;5d&#8208;Orbital Hybridization: Durable High&#8208;Performance AEM Water Electrolysis and Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

This work demonstrates that an asymmetric 3d&#8208;5d&#8208;orbital hybridization strategy can effectively break the conventional activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off in electrocatalysis. The anion exchange membrane water electrolysis based on PtCo@NPC catalyst demonstrated stable operation for over 522&#160;h at a current density of 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a decay rate as low as 0.103&#160;mV h&#8722;1. Meanwhile, the assembled Zn&#8211;air batteries achieved an exceptionally long cycle life exceeding 2520 cycles.








Abstract
Decoupling key intermediates&#8217; adsorption via asymmetric 3d&#8208;5d&#8208;orbital hybridization overcomes the intrinsic scaling relation bottleneck, enabling rational design of high&#8208;performance, durable multifunctional electrocatalysts for anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) and Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Here, we reveal that asymmetric 3d&#8208;5d&#8208;orbital hybridization, engineered through the synergy of lattice strain and defect structures in a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported PtCo alloy (PtCo@NPC), effectively decouples these adsorption energies of key intermediates. PtCo@NPC demonstrates exceptional multifunctional electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media. Density functional theory calculations suggest that electronic structure modulation tunes the adsorption characteristics of intermediates, while X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy confirms the corresponding changes in the electronic states of surface Pt and Co atoms. When deployed in devices, PtCo@NPC enables AEMWEs to operate stably for 522&#160;h at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a voltage decay rate of only 0.103&#160;mV h&#8722;1 and empowers ZABs to achieve a long cycle life of over 2520 cycles at 5.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This study highlights electronic&#8208;structure modulation as a powerful strategy for advanced energy technologies.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Induced Triple Synergistic Modulation of CuBi Clusters for Enhanced Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered defects in CuBi clusters concurrently stabilize the critical *NO2 intermediate, enhance CO2 adsorption, and activate water molecules, synergistically boosting the coreduction of NO3&#8722; and CO2 to urea. This triple synergistic modulation breaks the kinetic bottleneck, leading to a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 53.1%, and a tenfold increase over its well&#8208;defined counterpart.








Abstract
Electrochemical C&#8211;N coupling of CO2 and NO3&#8722; is a promising green approach for synthesizing urea. However, achieving efficient C&#8211;N coupling remains challenging because of the kinetic mismatch between CO2 and NO3&#8722; reduction. Stabilizing key N&#8208;containing intermediates to facilitate their coupling with C&#8208;containing intermediates is crucial for achieving high Faradaic efficiency. In this study, defect&#8208;rich CuBi clusters (D&#8208;CuBi) were synthesized, and the effects of the enhanced functionalities of the defects of D&#8208;CuBi on the performance of urea synthesis at different critical processes were systematically investigated. Density functional theory calculations and in situ electrochemical spectroscopic analysis revealed that the defects in D&#8208;CuBi facilitated the adsorption of CO2 and prevented the desorption of the key *NO2 intermediate as NO2&#8722;. Moreover, these sites facilitated the adsorption of active water molecules, thereby accelerating the reaction kinetics for urea production. As a result, the D&#8208;CuBi catalyst achieved a remarkable urea Faradaic efficiency of 53.1% and a yield rate of 2.57&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at&#160;&#8722;1.0&#160;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, representing an approximately tenfold enhancement over the intact CuBi. This work presents insight into urea electrosynthesis from CO2 and NO3&#8722; through defect engineering.

         <title>Selectively Electrocatalytic Reductive Dehydroxylation of 2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol to 3&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ol over Cu Nanowire Arrays at Industrial Current Densities</title>

         <dc:description>
A sustainable and low&#8208;cost electrocatalytic strategy is highlighted for selectively reductive dehydroxylation of 1,4&#8208;butenediol (BED) to 3&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ol (BTO) under ambient conditions. Cu nanowire arrays accelerate the dissociation of C&#9472;OH bond in BED and exhibit a high BTO production rate of 190.8 mmol&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 at an industrial current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic reductive dehydroxylation is a promising strategy for sustainable synthesis of commodity and high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals but remains a formidable challenge due to the high dissociation energy of C&#9472;OH bond. Here, we report a selectively electrocatalytic reductive dehydroxylation of 1,4&#8208;butenediol (BED) to produce 3&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ol (BTO) over Cu nanowire arrays (Cu NWAs) under ambient conditions. A high BED conversion of &#8764;90.5% and a BTO selectivity of &#8764;80.2% are achieved at &#8211;0.9&#160;V versus RHE. Even in a large&#8208;scale two&#8208;electrode H&#8208;type elecrolyser (1&#160;L), the Cu NWAs stably exhibit a BED conversion of &#8805;&#160;92.3%, a BTO selectivity of &#8805;&#160;82.7%, and a BTO production rate of 190.8 mmol&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 at an industrial current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the Cu surface facilitates the dissociation of C&#9472;OH bond in BED and the desorption of BTO, which thus promotes the selective dehydroxylation of BED to BTO. This work highlights a sustainable and efficient strategy for producing high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Carbonized Polymer Dots as Versatile Nanocarrier for Bioincompatible Fluorophore Imaging</title>

Orthogonal anchoring unlocks the potential of CPDs as efficient bioincompatible fluorescent dye nanocarriers.








Abstract
Fluorophores with excellent emission often come at the cost of cell permeability, and this long&#8208;standing dilemma has limited their effective applications in fluorescence bioimaging to some degree. We report a paradigm&#8208;shifting discovery that carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) can function as a versatile, noncovalent translocation platform for a vast spectrum of otherwise impermeable fluorophores. Our investigation began with the serendipitous observation that a new molecule, 1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrahydroimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;7&#8208;carboxylic acid (HECA), forms a stable, cell&#8208;permeable nanocomplex with carbonized polymer dots (CPDs&#8208;280) via noncovalent interactions (loading capacity &#8764;50.8%). This prompted a systematic exploration, which revealed that CPDs&#8208;280 possess a remarkable capacity to override the innate targeting signals of diverse organelle&#8208;specific dyes, rerouting them to the cytosol and demonstrating a carrier&#8208;dominated localization mechanism. The platform's generality was rigorously proven by delivering custom&#8208;designed, membrane&#8208;impermeable amphiphilic dyes (ESY&#8208;Na+ and ESY), which remained inert alone but produced intense intracellular luminescence upon noncovalent complexation. This robust, cargo&#8208;agnostic delivery capability is rooted in the abundant orthogonal anchor domains on the CPD's surface, enabling multimodal binding without chemical modification. This work unveils a generic strategy to breach biological barriers, instantly unlocking the vast repository of underutilized fluorescent probes for advanced bioimaging and theranostics.

         <title>A Doughnut&#8208;Like Eu30 Catalyst for CO2 Photoreduction with Turnover Numbers Over Ten Million</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 30&#8208;europium doughnut&#8208;like cluster Eu30 constructed via a stepwise annular growth assembly mechanism serves as a high&#8208;performance catalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion with 1.72&#160;&#215;&#160;107 turnover numbers based on the cluster concentration. Experimental and computational results indicate that the excellent performance of Eu30, as the first example of pure lanthanide cluster catalyst, can be attributed to its high redox activity with appropriate energy levels.








Abstract
Polynuclear metal clusters can be potentially high&#8208;performance catalysts for the CO2 reduction owing to the unique spatial structures among multiple active centers. Herein, two 30&#8208;nuclear doughnut&#8208;like lanthanide clusters (Eu30 and Dy30) were synthesized via in situ tandem reaction following a stepwise annular growth mechanism. In contrast to the Dy&#8208;based analog, Eu30 serves as a high&#8208;performance catalyst in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion with 98% selectivity and a record&#8208;high turnover number reaching 1.720&#160;&#215;&#160;107, a rare case with only lanthanide metals as the active centers. Experimental and computational results indicate that the excellent performance of Eu30, as the first example of pure lanthanide cluster catalyst, can be attributed to its high redox activity with an appropriate LUMO energy level.

         <title>Single Halide Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Mn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single halide electrolytes were proposed at the first time with reversible Mn plating&#8208;stripping. The optimized MnBr2 electrolyte displays superior Mn plating&#8208;stripping stability with &#8764;100% efficiency under 1&#8211;50 mAh cm&#8722;2, supported by [MnBrx]2&#8722;x solvates. When paring Mn anode with organic host, activated carbon and Br&#8722;/Br0 cathodes, high&#8208;performance MMBs were demonstrated with long cycling life (&gt;2000 cycles) and high voltage (1.6&#160;V).








Abstract
Rechargeable manganese (Mn) batteries have risen as a highly promising battery technology for sustainable energy storage due to rich abundance, high capacity and low working potential of Mn metal. The key challenge lies at developing advanced Mn&#8208;based electrolyte ensuring reversible Mn plating/stripping. Herein, we report new Mn electrolytes based on low&#8208;cost single halide (MnBr2 or MnCl2), relative to the benchmark hybrid system (MnCl2&#8208;AlCl3&#8208;Mn(TFSI)2; TFSI&#160;=&#160;bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide), for high&#8208;performance Mn metal batteries (MMBs). In the optimized solvent system, for instance, MnBr2 dissociates as various solvated [MnBrx]2&#8722;x (0&#160;&#8804;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;4) ions with assistance of triethyl phosphate. No passivation layer is formed on Mn anode owing to non&#8208;reducibility of Br&#8722;. The MnBr2 electrolyte displays superior Mn plating/stripping stability (&gt;1300&#160;h) with near integer Coulombic efficiency under practical areal capacities of 1&#8211;50 mAh cm&#8722;2. The overpotential is suppressed as low as &lt;200&#160;mV at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. When paring the Mn metal anode with different cathodes like organic Mn2+ hosts, activated carbon and even a Br&#8722;/Br0 conversion cathode, high&#8208;performance MMBs have been demonstrated with long cycling life (&gt;2000 cycles) and high voltage (1.6&#160;V). Our work represents a brand&#8208;new electrolyte design concept for advanced MMBs and can be readily expanded to other multivalent metal batteries.

Our work represents a brand-new electrolyte design concept for advanced MMBs and can be readily expanded to other multivalent metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Mechanism of&#160;Photocatalytic CO2 Cycloaddition over Linker&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three isoreticular Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X&#160;=&#160;F, H, and Me) are fabricated with regulated linker excitation energy and defect&#8208;mediated linker&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;transfer barrier. Among them, Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H achieves the optimal energetic balance, delivering the highest photocatalytic activity for CO2 cycloaddition with epoxides. In&#8208;situ studies reveal that the [Br&#8722;&#183;&#183;&#183;TBA+]&#8764;CO2 adduct facilitates electron transfer and lowers the energy requirement for CO2&#8226;&#8722; formation, thereby promoting CO2 fixation.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 cycloaddition represents a promising route for solar&#8208;driven synthesis of value&#8208;added C2+ chemicals and simultaneously mitigating anthropogenic CO2 emissions. However, the pivotal step of direct one&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to CO2&#8226;&#8722; requires a very high reduction potential of &#8722;1.9&#160;V versus NHE, posing a formidable challenge. In this study, cerium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with linker&#8208;induced defects, specifically Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X&#160;=&#160;Me, H, and F), are investigated to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of photocatalytic CO2 cycloaddition. Among them, Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H, which strikes an optimal balance between light absorption and charge separation, demonstrates superior catalytic performance (yield&#160;&gt; 90%) when coupled with tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) as a co&#8208;catalyst. In&#8208;situ experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that TBAB stabilizes CO2 through the formation of [Br&#8722;&#183;&#183;&#183;TBA+]&#8764;CO2 adducts, which lowers the thermodynamic energy requirement for CO2&#8226;&#8722; generation from 0.66&#160;eV (in the direct CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO2&#8226;&#8722; route) to &#8722;0.90&#160;eV. This potential modulation promotes efficient photoelectron transfer from the MOFs to CO2, substantially enhancing the overall cycloaddition efficiency.

         <dc:description>
This work reports a Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition/&#946;&#8208;fluoride elimination process for the construction of fluorinated cyclobutenes bearing chiral quaternary carbon centers with high enantioselectivity. Subsequent in situ treatment with a distinct aryl boronate enables a one&#8208;pot bis&#8208;defluoroarylation, affording unsymmetrical diarylated cyclobutenes.








Abstract
Fluorinated four&#8208;membered rings represent valuable structural motifs in bioactive molecules and pharmaceuticals; however, the asymmetric synthesis of such fluorinated frameworks bearing chiral quaternary carbon centers has not yet been achieved. Herein, we report a Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective defluoroarylation of gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclobutenes with aryl boronates, enabling the asymmetric construction of fluorinated cyclobutenes bearing chiral quaternary carbon centers with high enantioselectivity via an addition/&#946;&#8208;fluoride elimination process. In situ treatment with an additional distinct aryl boronate enables one&#8208;pot bis&#8208;defluoroarylation to give unsymmetrical diarylated cyclobutenes.

         <title>Paired&#8208;Cell Ammonia over Black CoWO4 via Electrocatalysis&#8211;Acidification Cascade from Wastewater at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>

A paired NO3RR&#8208;UOR system using bifunctional oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich black CoWO4 achieves unprecedented bipolar NH3 production with an apparent Faradaic efficiency of 173.12% and an NH3 yield rate of 9.43&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. 








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) offers a sustainable alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, its practical implementation is limited by the sluggish and energy&#8208;demanding oxygen evolution reaction at the anode. Herein, we report a strategically designed paired&#8208;electrolysis system coupling NO3RR with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), followed by chemical acidification, to establish an economical route of bipolar ammonia (NH3) production, using a black CoWO4 (B&#8208;CoWO4) with abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) as the electrocatalyst. B&#8208;CoWO4 shows a record&#8208;breaking performance with a current density of &#8764;1.25 A cm&#8722;2 at an ultra&#8208;low potential of 0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Combined spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses reveal a &#8220;fill&#8208;restore&#8221; cycle of OVs during NO3RR: oxygen from NO3&#8722; incorporates into the OVs, which are subsequently restored after the formation of NH3. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the OVs modify the electronic structure of the catalyst and facilitate the formation of key intermediate (NO3H*). Importantly, in the coupled NO3RR||UOR flow&#8208;cell system, B&#8208;CoWO4 delivers an apparent bipolar NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 173.12% and a production rate of 9.43&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. This integrated strategy boosts overall energy efficiency and enables simultaneous valorization of nitrate&#8208;contaminated water and urea&#8208;rich wastewater streams.

         <title>Regulation of Active Hydrogen and Nitrate Concentration: Pulsed Potential Strategies in Nitrate Electroreduction Microenvironments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrate concentration acts as a switch in electrocatalytic reduction: high levels suppress active hydrogen, promoting nitrogen formation, while low levels favor ammonia. We thus design a pulsed&#8208;potential strategy to dynamically create a high&#8208;concentration microenvironment at the electrode interface. This approach achieves both high nitrate removal rates and near&#8208;unity selectivity toward nitrogen.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrate (eNO3RR) plays a significant role in the nitrogen cycle and environmental remediation. The dynamics of active hydrogen in the eNO3RR were studied in depth by varying the nitrate concentration and applying a pulsed&#8208;potential approach. The effect of both factors on regulation of the degree of hydrogenation of the intermediates and the product distribution was evaluated. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that elevated nitrate levels decrease the energy barrier for *NO to *ONNO conversion, enhancing the adsorption of *NO3. The experimental results indicate that under high nitrate concentrations, copper&#8208;palladium (CuPd) catalysts exhibit faster reaction kinetics and higher nitrogen selectivity. In situ characterizations illuminated the critical role of active hydrogen on reaction intermediates. The CuPd catalyst achieved 95% NO3&#8208;N conversion and 99% N2 selectivity at 1&#160;M nitrate by pulse potential modulation of the active hydrogen concentration on the catalyst surface. Finite element analysis (FEA) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations verified that pulsed potentials modulate the local nitrate and hydrogen ion concentrations. The present work brings the eNO3RR closer to practical applications, aiding in environmental protection and the balance of the nitrogen cycle.

     alt="Regulation of Active Hydrogen and Nitrate Concentration: Pulsed Potential Strategies in Nitrate Electroreduction Microenvironments"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrate concentration acts as a switch in electrocatalytic reduction: high levels suppress active hydrogen, promoting nitrogen formation, while low levels favor ammonia. We thus design a pulsed-potential strategy to dynamically create a high-concentration microenvironment at the electrode interface. This approach achieves both high nitrate removal rates and near-unity selectivity toward nitrogen.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical reduction of nitrate (eNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR) plays a significant role in the nitrogen cycle and environmental remediation. The dynamics of active hydrogen in the eNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR were studied in depth by varying the nitrate concentration and applying a pulsed-potential approach. The effect of both factors on regulation of the degree of hydrogenation of the intermediates and the product distribution was evaluated. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that elevated nitrate levels decrease the energy barrier for *NO to *ONNO conversion, enhancing the adsorption of *NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The experimental results indicate that under high nitrate concentrations, copper-palladium (CuPd) catalysts exhibit faster reaction kinetics and higher nitrogen selectivity. In situ characterizations illuminated the critical role of active hydrogen on reaction intermediates. The CuPd catalyst achieved 95% NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-N conversion and 99% N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity at 1&#160;M nitrate by pulse potential modulation of the active hydrogen concentration on the catalyst surface. Finite element analysis (FEA) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations verified that pulsed potentials modulate the local nitrate and hydrogen ion concentrations. The present work brings the eNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR closer to practical applications, aiding in environmental protection and the balance of the nitrogen cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity of a Magnesium(0) Complex with a Polarized Mg&#948;&#8722;&#9472;Ca&#948;+ Bond</title>

Mixing metals: The elusive unsupported two&#8208;center&#8208;two&#8208;electron Mg&#9472;Ca bond has been realized by using a combination of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate and amidinate ligands. Due to electronegativity differences (Mg: 1.31, Ca: 1.00) the formal oxidation states are Mg0&#9472;CaII. The polarized Mg&#948;&#175;&#9472;Ca&#948;+ bond is considerably more reactive than the established MgI&#9472;MgI bond.








Abstract
Despite numerous examples of Mg&#9472;Mg bound complexes, complexes with unsupported two&#8208;center&#8208;two&#8208;electron Mg&#9472;Ca bonds so far always eluded their isolation. This is due to Mg&#948;&#175;&#8208;Ca&#948;+ polarization and their inherently very high reactivity resulting in oxidative addition to C&#9472;H bonds in either the ligand or solvent. Using a combination of bulky &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI*) and amidinate (Am*) ligands, we now present (BDI*)Mg&#8208;Ca(Am*); BDI* = HC[C(tBu)N(DIPeP)]2, DIPeP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;Et2C&#8208;phenyl; Am* = tBuC(N&#8208;DIPP)2, DIPP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;iPr&#8208;phenyl. The crystal structure shows a Mg&#9472;Ca bond of 3.298&#160;&#197; and Mg/Ca NPA charges of&#160;+0.66/+1.28. This reflects considerable Mg&#948;&#175;&#8208;Ca&#948;+ polarization and is in line with the formal oxidation states Mg0&#8208;CaII. Effective&#8208;Oxidation&#8208;State (EOS) analysis confirms these formal oxidation states, but a low reliability index of 69.8% indicates that these are not fully representative for the electron distribution. Atoms&#8208;In&#8208;Molecules (AIM) shows a bond&#8208;critical&#8208;point on the Mg&#8211;Ca axis but a non&#8208;nuclear&#8208;attractor (NNA) was not observed. EDA&#8208;NOCV using two different fragmentations, (BDI*)Mg&#713;/(Am*)Ca+ or (BDI*)Mg&#9679;/(Am*)Ca&#9679;, shows that the complex is best described as a combination of neutral radicals. The Mg0&#8211;CaII/MgI&#8211;CaI ambiguity results in a highly reactive Mg&#948;&#175;&#9472;Ca&#948;+ bond. This is confirmed by its reaction with CyN&#9552;C&#9552;NCy and Ph2C&#9552;CH2 showing the electrophilic nature of Ca and nucleophilic reactivity for Mg.

         <title>Efficient Ethanol Dehydrogenation to Acetaldehyde and H2 via Synergistic Thermocatalysis and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we design a bifunctional catalytic layer comprising Ru/C and PdAu/C within a high&#8208;temperature polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer. This architecture synergistically combines thermocatalytic ethanol dehydrogenation (EDHR) with electrochemical hydrogen oxidation (HOR), allowing the Ru/C component to drive ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;acetaldehyde conversion while PdAu/C rapidly oxidizes residual acetaldehyde intermediates in the catalytic layer to acetic acid. This process shifts the reaction equilibrium toward sustained dehydrogenation.








Abstract
The dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde and H2 represents an attractive synthetic route, owing to the versatile applications of acetaldehyde and the high atom economy. In this work, efficient ethanol dehydrogenation was achieved at the anode of a high&#8208;temperature polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer by integrating thermocatalytic ethanol dehydrogenation (EDHR) with electrochemical hydrogen oxidation (HOR) over Ru/C and PdAu/C composite catalytic layer. The Ru/C serves as a bifunctional catalyst for the EDHR and HOR, and the PdAu/C could rapidly electrooxidize retained acetaldehyde of the catalyst layer into acetic acid, thereby effectively promoting the dehydrogenation of ethanol. Under the conditions of 200 &#176;C and 0.6&#160;V, this reaction enabled high production rates of acetaldehyde (1479&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 99.06% selectivity) at the anode and H2 (1728&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) at the cathode, substantially outperforming traditional thermal catalytic and electrocatalytic processes. This work provides a novel strategy for efficient alcohol dehydrogenation and facilitates the sustainable synthesis of value&#8208;added products.

         <title>Sono&#8208;Flexocatalytic Tumor Suppression Enabled by SrTiO3 Nanoflexocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The centrosymmetric SrTiO3 nanoflexocatalysts undergo periodic deformation upon ultrasound irradiation, enabling efficient electron&#8208;hole separation. This process leads to a robust built&#8208;in electric field that drives substantial surface charge accumulation, which synergistically enhances the production of reactive oxygen species. The resulting sono&#8208;flexocatalytic therapy potently suppresses tumor growth through ROS&#8208;mediated apoptosis.








Abstract
Despite piezocatalytic tumor therapy offers a promising non&#8208;invasive modality for disease treatment, its application is fundamentally limited by the requirement for non&#8208;centrosymmetric piezocatalysts. To solve this critical issue, we present a novel &#8220;sono&#8208;flexocatalytic therapy&#8221; (SFT) strategy using centrosymmetric strontium titanate (SrTiO3) nanocatalysts. Under ultrasound irradiation, SrTiO3 generates significant flexoelectric polarization due to the induced strain gradients, effectively separating charges. This drives robust redox reactions on the nanocatalyst surfaces, producing abundant cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions within tumor cells. The resultant ROS surge induces severe oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately apoptosis, effectively suppressing tumor growth as validated by both in vitro and in vivo studies. Furthermore, theoretical simulations elucidate the specific strain&#8208;gradient dependent sono&#8208;flexocatalytic mechanism. This work pioneers sono&#8208;flexocatalytic tumor therapy by leveraging ultrasound&#8208;triggered flexoelectricity in SrTiO3 nanocatalysts, thereby not only introducing centrosymmetric biomaterials into sonocatalytic treatments but also establishing a new paradigm for pancatalytic medicine with broad material applicability.

         <title>CO&#8208;Induced Reconstruction of Cu&#8211;ZnZrOx Catalyst Enables Synergistic CO2/CO Co&#8208;Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that adding CO to CO2&#8211;H2 feeds induces the restructuring of the Cu&#8211;ZnZrOx catalyst, generating abundant CuZn&#8211;ZnOx interfacial sites. These interfaces drive a synergistic, spatially separated dual&#8208;pathway mechanism, enabling highly efficient methanol synthesis from CO&#8211;CO2 feeds and enhancing activity by up to 2.2&#8208;fold compared to CO&#8208;free feed.

In CO2 hydrogenation, efforts have largely emphasized CO2 activation while overlooking how to design active phase for the co&#8208;conversion of CO2 and the kinetically distinct byproduct CO. Here, it is found that adding CO to CO2&#8211;H2 feeds boosts methanol productivity by up to 2.2&#8208;fold via a pronounced synergistic promotion of both CO2 and CO hydrogenation over a Cu&#8211;ZnZrOx catalyst. In situ spectroscopy reveals that CO accelerates Zn reduction and migration onto Cu, increasing Zn0/Cu ratio, Zn2+/Cu, and Cu+/Cu fraction, while reducing exposed surface Cu from 42% to 19%. This CO&#8208;induced restructuring enriches Zn exposure, drives CuZn alloy formation, and creates abundant CuZn alloy&#8211;ZnOx interfaces that stabilize Cu+ sites. These interfaces enable a cooperative dual&#8208;pathway mechanism: CO2 is hydrogenated mainly via the formate route at alloy&#8211;ZnOx sites, whereas CO follows the formyl route on Cu sites. Additionally, in situ&#8208;formed water accelerates conversion of the rate&#8208;determining CH3O* intermediate in the CO pathway. Together, CO&#8208;driven evolution of active sites, synergistic dual&#8208;pathway catalysis, and water&#8208;assisted promotion yield highly efficient methanol synthesis from mixed CO&#8211;CO2 feeds.

         <title>Programmable DNA Nanostructures for hTERT Compartmentalization and Translocation in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA condensate is self&#8208;assembled from DNA&#8208;based modules mediated by telomerase inside cancer cells, achieving the regulation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) translocation by controlling its export from the nucleus and preventing its mitochondrial localization. This process induces mitochondrial dysfunction and effectively inhibits cancer cell proliferation. 








Abstract
Protein translocation is essential for cellular function, and compartmentalizing proteins can regulate their activity. However, constructing artificial intracellular compartments to control this process remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the artificial dynamic assembly of DNA condensates in the cytoplasm, enabling the specific compartmentalization of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and effectively inhibiting its canonical and non&#8208;canonical activities. DNA&#8208;based condensates are formed through the dynamic assembly of branched DNA structures incorporating a mitochondria&#8208;targeting triphenylphosphine and a telomerase primer for telomerase recognition. Upon uptake by cancer cells, the primer interacts with telomerase, triggering a strand displacement reaction that releases X&#8208;shaped DNA. The sticky palindromic sequences in the X&#8208;shaped DNA promote self&#8208;assembly, forming DNA condensates on mitochondria. These condensates disrupt mitochondria functions, increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and stimulating the export of hTERT from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Once in the cytoplasm, hTERT is specifically captured by the DNA condensates, preventing its translocation to mitochondria. The reduction of hTERT in both nucleus and mitochondria further results in impaired cellular proliferation and mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer cells. This work provides a highly controllable strategy for manipulating protein translocation through compartmentalization in living cells, offering a promising new avenue for modulating cellular behavior.

         <title>Electrochemical Degradation of Perfluoroalkyl Sulfonates via Sulfonate to Carboxylate Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a novel approach for the degradation of perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) involving a controlled, electromediated, sulfonate&#8208;to&#8208;carboxylate headgroup conversion. We apply this method to shorter chain PFSAs and provide key mechanistic insights that contribute to a broader understanding of the molecular pathways underlying pollutant degradation and highlight the power of organic electrochemistry in addressing environmental challenges.








Abstract
Efficient, scalable, and well&#8208;understood methods for degrading per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are essential for limiting their numerous negative human health and environmental effects. Electrochemical methods are promising for PFAS degradation but are currently not yet well developed for use in non&#8208;aqueous conditions relevant for PFAS sorbent regeneration without resorting to specialized electrode materials. Herein, we report the mediated electrochemical conversion of perfluoroalkyl sulfonates to carboxylates using commercial Pt electrodes in acetonitrile. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was converted primarily to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) alongside several shorter&#8208;chain carboxylates through a proposed radical desulfonation and hydroxide coupling process explored in a detailed mechanistic study. Following the near&#8208;complete conversion of PFOS to perfluoroalkyl carboxylates, all species are mineralized to fluoride and non&#8208;fluorinated carbon byproducts using established low&#8208;temperature DMSO/NaOH conditions. HPLC&#8208;MS, ion chromatography, and quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods determined a significant loss in fluorine and carbon balance after electrochemistry, which we attribute to the production of volatile byproducts. This degradation approach provides new insights into PFAS degradation mechanisms under highly oxidative, non&#8208;aqueous conditions and highlights the potential for organic electrochemistry to address environmental challenges by promoting controlled and selective destruction pathways for common organic pollutants.

         <title>Boosting Crystal Growth and Radioluminescence in Hybrid Cu(I) Halide Scintillators via Additive&#8208;Strengthened Ionic and Electron&#8211;Phonon Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a computationally guided &#8220;one stone, two birds&#8221; additive strategy that simultaneously enhances ionic interactions between the C6H18N22+ organic ligand and Cu&#8211;I clusters, and promotes intersystem charge transfer through controlled lattice distortion. This dual modulation not only accelerates solute aggregation at crystal growth interfaces, enabling expanded crystal morphology, but also strengthens electron&#8211;phonon coupling, thereby boosting STE mediated radioluminescence.








Abstract
We herein address two fundamental challenges in rod&#8208;like ionic hybrid copper(I) halide scintillators&#8212;insufficient metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer leading to low radioluminescence efficiency, and anisotropic crystal growth that restricts the fabrication of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystalline scintillator screen. Guided by computational insight, we introduce a &#8220;one stone, two birds&#8221; molecular strategy employing neutral 1,2&#8208;propanediamine (1,2&#8208;PDA) as a dual&#8208;function additive in C6H18N2Cu2I4. Comprehensive mechanistic studies reveal that 1,2&#8208;PDA not only strengthens ionic interactions between organic ligand (C6H18N22+) and Cu(I) halide clusters, promoting oriented aggregation at crystal interfaces, but also induces significant lattice distortion upon defect incorporation, which enhances intersystem crossing and intensifies electron&#8211;phonon coupling, thereby boosting self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission. This synergistic mechanism yields a 3&#8208;fold enhancement in photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY: 17.53% to 52.96%) and a 2.77&#8208;fold enhancement in radioluminescence intensity. Moreover, we achieved a large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystalline film (&#8776;10&#160;&#215;&#160;7&#160;&#215;&#160;0.31&#160;mm3) demonstrates exceptional X&#8208;ray imaging resolution of 22.3&#160;lp mm&#8722;1. This approach demonstrates broad applicability across diverse hybrid metal halides, concurrently improving crystal dimensionality and scintillation performance, thus establishing a versatile molecular design rule for high&#8208;performance radiation detection materials.

Abstract

         <title>Dual&#8208;Induced Confined Synthesis of Metastable &#947;&#8208;MnO2 Nanoclusters in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient Ozone Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An universal dual&#8208;induce strategy for preparing MOF&#8208;confined sub&#8208;3&#160;nm metal&#8208;oxide nanocluster (UMONs@MOF) was constructed with exceptional compatibility to incorporate diverse metal oxides across the periodic table and various canonical MOFs. Replacing the pristine components with the composite, the ozone decomposition efficiency of UMONs@MOF maintains 100% under entire humidity for 100&#160;h owing to the nanoconfinement, spatial restriction and cluster&#8211;cluster cooperative effects, thus substantially lowering the activation energy.








Abstract
Ultrafine metal oxide nanoclusters (UMONs) exhibit remarkable catalytic potential due to their high specific surface area; however, achieving precise control over both the size and crystal phase of UMONs remains a significant challenge. Herein, we developed a dual&#8208;induced confined synthesis strategy that couples hydrophobic gating with thermally triggered phase transformation to precisely confine UMONs within the pores of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). 13 UMONs@MOF composites were successfully synthesized with the metal cations in UMONs spanning different regions of the periodic table. Notably, sub&#8208;3&#160;nm metastable &#947;&#8208;MnO2 was stabilized and confined within MIL&#8208;101(Fe) for the first time. The optimized 15% &#947;&#8208;MnO2@MIL&#8208;101(Fe) showed a durable 100% O3 removal efficiency for over 100&#160;h. This performance was maintained in a continuous air flow containing 40&#160;ppm O3 at a high gas hourly space velocity of 1.7&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;h&#8722;1 over a wide humidity range of 10%&#8211;90%. Mechanistic studies reveal that its superior catalytic activity originates from the synergistic effect between the confined &#947;&#8208;MnO2 active sites and the Fe3O clusters in the MIL&#8208;101(Fe). This work provides a universal approach for the precise control of the size and crystal phase of UMONs, paving the way for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts.

Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide&#8208;catalyzed long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;induced Group 13, 14, and 15 elementalizations of alkenes and alkynes are achieved through in situ production of tert&#8208;butyl radicals employing blue/green/orange (up to 600&#160;nm) LEDs.

Abstract
We present di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP)&#8208;catalyzed long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;induced Group 13, 14, and 15 elementalizations of alkenes and alkynes, through in situ production of tert&#8208;butyl radicals, followed by a hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer process generating silyl, germyl, stannyl, alkyl, boryl, and phosphoryl radicals. This mild and photosensitizer&#8208;free methodology employing blue (450&#160;nm)/green (530&#160;nm)/orange (600&#160;nm) LEDs affords high chemoselectivity and broad functional group tolerance compared to conventional use of shorter&#8208;wavelength light. Synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational data are consistent with a vibration&#8208;mediated photolysis mechanism of DTBP involving electronic excitation from vibrationally excited ground states (S0&#956;n) to the excited state (S0&#956;n&#8594;Sn transitions), driven by ultraweak absorption of long&#8208;wavelength visible light.

         <title>Complementary Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Design for Blue OLEDs Beyond the Concentration Limit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complementary multi&#8208;resonance (MR)&#8208;TADF emitters enable a confinement&#8208;assisted guided energy transfer (CAGE) process, where resonant singlet confinement directs exciton flow while suppressing triplet diffusion. This dual&#8208;MR system effectively mitigates concentration quenching, achieving enhanced efficiency and operational stability in deep&#8208;blue OLEDs.








Abstract
Advances in boron&#8208;based organic compounds exhibiting multi&#8208;resonance (MR)&#8208;type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) have been primarily driven by their potential as narrowband blue emitters for wide&#8208;gamut display applications. Nevertheless, the intrinsically planar architecture of MR&#8208;type TADF molecules often leads to pronounced concentration quenching at elevated doping levels, posing a significant impediment to realizing highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Notably, the exciton quenching effect observed here fundamentally follows the same energy transfer mechanism that underlies exciton migration. Based on this insight, we developed a system comprising two MR&#8208;TADF molecules with analogous electronic structures that enable mutual exciton energy transfer. The resultant complementary MR&#8208;TADF emitter system exhibits substantially improved resistance to concentration quenching relative to single MR&#8208;TADF emitters, effectively suppressing efficiency drop and conferring enhanced control over exciton density. We envisage that this strategy represents a pivotal step toward overcoming the longstanding challenge of concentration quenching in MR&#8208;TADF materials, thereby enabling the development of high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue OLEDs.

         <title>Electrochemical Controllable Divergent Carboxylation and Hydrocarboxylation of Alkynes with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical controllable divergent carboxylation and hydrocarboxylation of alkynes with CO2 was developed for the green synthesis of various unsaturated and saturated aryl substituted mono&#8208; and di&#8208;carboxylic acids.








Abstract
Carboxylation and hydrocarboxylation of alkynes with CO2 for the synthesis of value&#8208;added and versatile carboxylic acids are of great importance. However, harsh reaction conditions, poor selectivity, practicability, and sustainability have always restricted its application. Electrochemical synthesis has been considered as a practical and environmentally friendly organic synthesis strategy via a tunable redox process. Hence, herein, an efficient electrochemical controllable divergent carboxylation and hydrocarboxylation of alkynes with CO2 was achieved to overcome the limitation of traditional methods. Four kinds of arylpropiolic acid, cinnamic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, and their derivatives can be obtained with good selectivity by regulating substrates, solvents, and electrolytes. The method features broad substrate scope, divergent transformation with good selectivity, scalability, additional reducing agent&#8208;, hydrogen donor&#8208;, metal&#8208;, and ligand&#8208;free conditions, which offer novel insights into electrochemically driven CO2 fixation and alkyne functionalization.

     alt="Electrochemical Controllable Divergent Carboxylation and Hydrocarboxylation of Alkynes with CO2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical controllable divergent carboxylation and hydrocarboxylation of alkynes with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was developed for the green synthesis of various unsaturated and saturated aryl substituted mono- and di-carboxylic acids.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carboxylation and hydrocarboxylation of alkynes with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the synthesis of value-added and versatile carboxylic acids are of great importance. However, harsh reaction conditions, poor selectivity, practicability, and sustainability have always restricted its application. Electrochemical synthesis has been considered as a practical and environmentally friendly organic synthesis strategy via a tunable redox process. Hence, herein, an efficient electrochemical controllable divergent carboxylation and hydrocarboxylation of alkynes with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was achieved to overcome the limitation of traditional methods. Four kinds of arylpropiolic acid, cinnamic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, and their derivatives can be obtained with good selectivity by regulating substrates, solvents, and electrolytes. The method features broad substrate scope, divergent transformation with good selectivity, scalability, additional reducing agent-, hydrogen donor-, metal-, and ligand-free conditions, which offer novel insights into electrochemically driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation and alkyne functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lattice Compressibility versus Emission Properties: A Trade&#8208;Off in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Bimetallic Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a series of hybrid La&#8208;Sb bimetallic bromides La(L)n[SbBr6], incorporating three different organic ligands (L&#160;=&#160;DMSO, MU and DMU). By altering the coordinating ligands, we systematically varied the hydrogen&#8208;bonding strength, which directly controlled the lattice compressibility. This work reveals a fundamental trade&#8208;off in these materials: high structural rigidity (low compressibility) is essential for stable and efficient emission under pressure, yet it concurrently limits pressure&#8208;induced tunability and can promote photoluminescence quenching. 








Abstract
Hybrid metal halide perovskites exhibit interesting optoelectronic properties that are highly tunable and sensitive via structural manipulation, whether intrinsically designed or induced by pressure stimuli. Their soft lattices are generally easy to compress, where the bulk modulus (B0) decreases with decreasing dimensionality from 3D to 0D. Here, we show that an unusually large B0 of 119&#160;GPa beyond 2&#160;GPa can be achieved through the control of coordinated solvent ligand in a 0D hybrid bimetallic bromides series, namely La(L)n[SbBr6] (L&#160;=&#160;dimethyl sulfoxide, 1&#8208;methylurea, and 1,3&#8208;dimethylurea). We identify a striking inverse relation between B0 and photoluminescence (PL) under pressure, mediated by hydrogen&#8208;bonding strength. Stronger hydrogen bonds create a more rigid structure (high B0), which causes a rapid quenching of emission. This phenomenon is generally observed in the La(L)n[SbBr6] series, with all undergoing a universal quenching of PL intensity once a compressibility limit is reached at &#8764;2&#160;GPa. This work provides a paradigm for controlling the compressibility in low&#8208;dimensional hybrid materials and establishes a fundamental principle regarding the compressibility and optical property evolutions.

         <title>Unlocking Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Deep&#8208;UV&#8208;Transparent Polar Organic Sulfonates through Connectivity Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A connectivity&#8208;regulation approach for the construction of the deep&#8208;ultraviolet transparent alkali&#8208;metal organic sulfonate Li[SO3(CH2)2OH], which exhibit second&#8208;harmonic generation responses at both visible and ultraviolet regions as well as sufficient birefringence, was reported.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance ultraviolet nonlinear optical (UV NLO) crystals requires both highly efficient NLO&#8208;functional primitives and their optimal alignment within non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures&#8212;a dual challenge difficult to address. In this study, we present a connectivity&#8208;regulation approach for construction of polar organic salts, which has been experimentally verified by systematically varying either the counter&#8208;cations or, more efficiently, the anionic alkyl tails of aliphatic sulfonates. Compositional evolution drives change in alignment of the sulfonate anions from antiparallel in the parent centrosymmetric compound Li[SO3(CH2)2X](H2O) (X&#160;=&#160;Cl and Br) to staggered antiparallel in the polar analogues Na[SO3(CH2)2X](H2O) and then to parallel in Li[SO3(CH2)2OH], affording a connectivity&#8208;dependent enhancement in linear and nonlinear optical properties. Li[SO3(CH2)2OH] simultaneously exhibits an ultrawide bandgap (&gt; 6.53&#160;eV) and the largest second&#8208;harmonic generation among deep&#8208;UV&#8208;transparent sulfonates (3.0&#160;&#215;&#160;KH2PO4 @ 1064&#160;nm), with sufficient birefringence to enable phase&#8208;matched fourth&#8208;harmonic generation at 266&#160;nm from Nd:YAG lasers. Theoretical calculations and crystal structure analyses suggest that the parallel alignment of the [SO3(CH2)2OH]&#8722; anions, facilitated through hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions and ionic bonding, is responsible for the strong optical performance. This study highlights that structural connectivity change can profoundly influence key NLO properties, initiating a new avenue for development of high&#8208;performance UV NLO organic salts.

         <title>Optimal Host&#8211;Guest Fit in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks to Achieve Record C2H2 Packing Density for Trace Acetylene Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In our study of the C2H2 adsorption of a series of pillared&#8208;layer MOFs, including CPL&#8208;1, ZU&#8208;901 and newly synthesized SXU&#8208;10, the unusual steep rise&#8208;to&#8208;saturation sorption isotherms at very low pressure regions have been rationalized to originate from elevated degree of host&#8211;guest shape fit, improving trace C2H2 uptake performances.








Abstract
Host&#8211;guest fit is critical in enzyme&#8208;substrate binding and useful for designing crystalline porous adsorbents to remove trace impurities; however, realization of such remains highly scarce, let alone to elucidate the atomic&#8208;level understanding on how to optimize such an effect. Herein, we demonstrate the systematic design of a pillared&#8208;layer MOF series (CPL&#8208;1) to achieve optimal host&#8211;guest fit through increasing the number of bulky groups, progressively enhancing the C2H2 adsorption performance. The newly synthesized, best&#8208;fit SXU&#8208;10 exhibits the most superior very&#8208;low&#8208;pressure C2H2 capture&#8212;reaching near saturation at just 2&#160;kPa. With record C2H2 packing densities of 483.9&#160;mg cm&#8722;3 at 1&#160;kPa and 733.97&#160;mg cm&#8722;3 at 100&#160;kPa, SXU&#8208;10 exhibits an uptake of 1.18&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 C2H2 at 1&#160;kPa and C2H2/C2H4 selectivity of 133 for 1/99 C2H2/C2H4 mixtures (all at 298&#160;K), along with exceptional stability and humidity tolerance, enabling the production of polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 from trace C2H2 mixtures under a challenging humid condition (80% RH). The unusual steep&#8208;rise&#8208;uptake phenomenon and significantly improved performance are attributed to the optimized host&#8211;guest shape fit at a sub&#8208;&#229;ngstr&#246;m precision which constrains the gate&#8208;opening flexibility, evidenced via in situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The present study sheds light on the molecular&#8208;level engineering of bioinspired porous adaptive materials.

         <title>Epitaxial Active Interface to Construct Intralattice&#8208;Bonded Asymmetric Bi1&#9472;O&#9472;Bi2 Sites for Robust CO2 Photoreduction to Acetic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 7, 9 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lattice bonded asymmetric Bi1&#8208;O&#8208;Bi2 active site is constructed through the epitaxial growth. This configuration facilitates directed charge transfer and favors the crucial C&#9472;C coupling step to form the OCCO* intermediate, leading to selective production of acetic acid.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven selective synthesis of C2 chemicals from CO2 is a crucial pathway for carbon cycling, but it is limited by the high kinetic barrier of C&#9472;C coupling. This study proposes an epitaxial growth strategy for lattice&#8208;bonded asymmetric sites. By constructing a Bi1&#9472;O&#9472;Bi2 site at the Bi3NbO7 nano&#8208;dots/Bi3O4Br nanosheet (BNO/BOB) interface to promote C&#9472;C coupling for acetic acid production, the photocatalytic conversion rate of CO2 to acetic acid can reach 192.3 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, with 91.4% selectivity. The apparent quantum efficiency at 380 and 400&#160;nm reach 9.49% and 6.57%, respectively. The key mechanism originates from a cascade electron effect triggered by the interfacial Bi1&#9472;O&#9472;Bi2 sites: the interfacial charge redistribution induces a strong built&#8208;in electric field, where high&#8208;energy electrons selectively occupy the 2&#960; antibonding orbitals of CO* intermediates, significantly weakening the C&#9472;O bond in CO* intermediate. Furthermore, the asymmetric charge redistribution effectively neutralizes the electrostatic repulsion between adjacent CO* intermediates, synergistically stabilizing the OCCO* transition state through d&#8208;&#960; electron feedback from Bi sites. The dual effects synergistically lower the energy barriers for both the C&#9472;C coupling and hydrogenation steps, ultimately steering the reaction pathway towards long&#8208;lasting acetic acid formation.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Electrochemical Regeneration of Spent LiFePO4 Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a redox&#8208;mediated electrochemical method for direct recycling of spent LiFePO4 battery cathodes. A water&#8208;soluble mediator, iron propylenediamine tetraacetate (Fe&#8208;PDTA), transports electrons into an off&#8208;electrode reservoir where it drives compositional and structural repair of degraded LiFePO4. This process achieves current densities up to 100&#160;mA/cm2 and regenerates LiFePO4 with performance comparable to pristine material.








ABSTRACT
Direct recycling of lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes offers considerable appeal over metallurgical approaches. Here, we demonstrate a mediated electrochemical method for direct regeneration of degraded LiFePO4 (LFP). The approach uses a redox mediator, iron propylenediamine tetraacetate, that undergoes electrochemical reduction and is circulated through an external reservoir, where it supplies the electrons needed to regenerate LFP in the presence of Li+ ions derived from LiOH oxidation. Rapid outer&#8208;sphere electron transfer is observed from the mediator to the degraded LFP material. This feature, together with good aqueous solubility of the mediator (0.3&#160;M), supports current densities up to 100&#160;mA/cm2, and this electrochemical recycling process is demonstrated on 100&#160;g scale. 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy is used to monitor the correction of structural defects in the degraded LFP, providing the basis for regeneration of LFP that matches the electrochemical performance of pristine LFP.

         <title>Product Ligand&#8208;Modification on Ni(OH)2 for Boosted Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Aromatic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
The development of active electrocatalysts for converting biomass&#8208;derived aromatic alcohols into value&#8208;added acids is of great significance. Ni(OH)2 has been employed as a cost&#8208;effective catalyst, unfortunately, suffering from rather low catalytic activity due to the considerable energy barrier to transform into active NiOOH and the weak interaction with reactants. To address these limitations, a novel &#8220;product ligand&#8208;modification&#8221; (PLM) strategy has been proposed here simply by adopting the target molecule ligands as modification units, which simultaneously facilitates the Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox kinetics and significantly enriches reactants at the catalytic surface via profound &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction. The PLM strategy has been demonstrated to exhibit exceptionally high performance in electro&#8208;oxidizing aromatic alcohols into corresponding acids across various product ligand&#8208;Ni(OH)2 (PL&#8208;Ni(OH)2) catalysts. As a typical paradigm, the aromatic ligand FDCA&#8208;modified Ni(OH)2 catalyst (termed FDCA&#8208;Ni(OH)2) demonstrates significantly enhanced BHMF electrocatalytic oxidation activity, featuring a BHMF conversion rate of &gt;99.4%, FDCA selectivity and yield of 99.2% and 98.6%, and Faradaic efficiency of 99.0%. Furthermore, FDCA&#8208;Ni(OH)2 features an excellent stability for over 250&#160;h in a flow electrolyzer to produce FDCA with a &gt;99.0% purity. This PLM strategy offers valuable insights into the performance enhancement of Ni(OH)2 catalyst for the targeted conversion of aromatic reactants.

         <title>A Modular Approach to N&#8208;Fluoroalkyl Amides via Nitrene Insertion Into Fluoroalkylcopper(I)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper/nitrene&#8208;mediated, modular three&#8208;component protocol for the synthesis of N&#8208;fluoroalkyl compounds was described. This method enables the first synthesis and pharmaceutical characterization of acyclic amides featuring N&#8211;C2F5 and N&#8211;CF2CO2Et groups, which are structures previously unreported in the literature. The isolation and structural elucidation of an [CuIN(CF3)(COAr)] copper complex, the first metal complex coordinated by an N&#8211;CF3 group, provides direct evidence supporting the proposed mechanism. Leveraging the diverse reactivity of copper, this platform is expected to facilitate access to a broader range of N&#8208;fluoroalkyl architectures.








ABSTRACT
We report herein the first copper&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component modular synthesis of N&#8208;fluoroalkyl amides from fluoroalkylcopper species ([CuI&#9472;CF3], [CuI&#9472;CF2CO2Et], and [CuI&#9472;C2F5]), a nitrene precursor (dioxazolone), and an electrophile, featuring broad substrate scope and the unprecedented construction of acyclic N&#8208;C2F5 and N&#8208;CF2CO2Et structures. The reaction proceeds via reaction of the dioxazolone with the fluoroalkylcopper complex to generate a nitrene/Cu intermediate, followed by nitrene migratory insertion into the [CuI&#9472;CRf] bond as the pivotal step that directly forges the N&#8211;fluoroalkyl bond. Such a key step was supported by isolation and single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray characterization of intermediates [(L1)CuIN(CF3)(COAr)] 5c and [CuI(N(CF3)(COAr))2]&#8722; 5d. Leveraging the versatile reactivity of copper, these intermediates react with various electrophiles to access a wide range of N&#8208;fluoroalkyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl(aryl)amides, and the derivatization of several drug molecules further demonstrates the synthetic utility of this approach.

&lt;p&gt;We report herein the first copper-mediated three-component modular synthesis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-fluoroalkyl amides from fluoroalkylcopper species ([Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#9472;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], [Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#9472;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Et], and [Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#9472;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]), a nitrene precursor (dioxazolone), and an electrophile, featuring broad substrate scope and the unprecedented construction of acyclic &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Et structures. The reaction proceeds via reaction of the dioxazolone with the fluoroalkylcopper complex to generate a nitrene/Cu intermediate, followed by nitrene migratory insertion into the [Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#9472;C&lt;sub&gt;Rf&lt;/sub&gt;] bond as the pivotal step that directly forges the &lt;i&gt;N&#8211;&lt;/i&gt;fluoroalkyl bond. Such a key step was supported by isolation and single-crystal x-ray characterization of intermediates [(&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;)Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;N(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(COAr)] &lt;b&gt;5c&lt;/b&gt; and [Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;(N(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(COAr))&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;b&gt;5d&lt;/b&gt;. Leveraging the versatile reactivity of copper, these intermediates react with various electrophiles to access a wide range of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-fluoroalkyl-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl(aryl)amides, and the derivatization of several drug molecules further demonstrates the synthetic utility of this approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovering the pH&#8208;independent Oxygen&#8211;Oxygen Formation via Direct Mn&#8208;oxo Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding O&#9472;O bond formation on metal&#8208;oxo species is key to elucidating catalytic oxidation processes. By tuning the connectivity of [MnO6] octahedra, this study reveals a pH&#8208;independent mechanism for direct O&#9472;O bond coupling through Mn&#8722;O in edge&#8208;shared structures. This pathway differs fundamentally from traditional nucleophilic water attack, offering a blueprint for designing efficient artificial catalysts.








ABSTRACT
Unraveling the mechanism of O&#9472;O bond formation on metal&#8208;oxo is critical yet remains a central challenge in electrocatalytic water oxidation. Herein, we show the pH&#8208;independent O&#9472;O bond formation pathway in edge&#8208;shared dual [MnO6] motifs. By manipulating the atomic&#8208;scale connectivity of [MnO6] units, two structurally well&#8208;defined sodium manganese pyrophosphate compounds with edge&#8208;sharing (Mn&#8208;edge) and corner&#8208;sharing (Mn&#8208;corner) [MnO6] octahedral configurations were synthesized with similar chemical composition and morphology, except that the Mn&#160;&#8764;&#160;Mn distance in Mn&#8208;edge is significantly shorter than that in Mn&#8208;corner. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses reveal that Mn&#8208;edge exhibits an unprecedented pH&#8208;independent evolution of O2. Isotope&#8208;labeling experiments and in situ Raman spectroscopy identify a direct coupling mechanism between Mn&#8722;O species in Mn&#8208;edge, bypassing the conventional nucleophilic water attack. Density functional theory calculations further support that Mn&#8208;oxo coupling between asymmetric MnVI&#160;&#8764;&#160;MnV centers drastically reduces the energy barrier for O&#9472;O bond formation. These findings establish the connectivity of [MnO6] as a critical descriptor for water oxidation mechanism and offer a new design strategy for efficient catalysts inspired by natural oxygen&#8208;evolving complexes.

         <title>Imidazolium Cation&#8208;Stabilized Interfacial Chemistry for Durable Aqueous Cadmium&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous cadmium&#8208;iodine (Cd//I2) battery is constructed through interfacial chemistry regulation. The cadmium anode effectively suppresses parasitic hydrogen evolution and enhances anode stability, while the incorporation of BMIM+ additives anchors polyiodide species, alleviating the polyiodide shuttle effect and reinforcing interfacial robustness. Benefiting from this dual regulation, the Cd//I2 battery delivers high capacity and ultralong cycling stability, demonstrating the promising potential of aqueous Cd metal batteries.








ABSTRACT
Aqueous metal batteries are attractive candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their intrinsic safety and low cost. However, their practical application is constrained by dendrite growth, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as well as dissolution&#8208;induced parasitic reactions of the cathode materials. Here, we report a durable cadmium&#8208;iodine (Cd//I2) battery enabled by a dual&#8208;interfacial chemistry regulation strategy. The Cd2+/Cd redox couple offers moderate potential to suppress HER and strong resistance to acidic and polyiodide corrosion, rendering Cd metal a highly stable anode. Moreover, the incorporation of 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation (BMIM+) induces preferential adsorption on the Cd anode, forming a functional interphase that lowers local charge density, suppresses dendrite growth, and promotes uniform Cd deposition. At the cathode, strong electrostatic interactions and steric hindrance between BMIM+ and polyiodide anions effectively mitigate the shuttle effect. Benefiting from these synergistic effects, the Cd//I2 battery delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 152.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1 and achieves ultralong cycling stability over 50,000 cycles, with an ultralow per&#8208;cycle capacity decay of 0.00032%. Even under a high I2 loading of 17.78&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the battery maintains 400 cycles with high specific capacity of 173.1 mAh g&#8722;1, underscoring its potential for practical application.

         <title>The Important Role of Carbonyl in Accelerating Reverse Intersystem Crossing for Selenium&#8208;Based Organoboron Narrowband Blue Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonyl and selenium embedded organoboron emitters are developed with a modulated short&#8208;distance CT transition that preserves narrowband blue emission while boosting the kRISC over 107 s&#8722;1 and shortening the delayed fluorescence lifetimes to 2.4&#160;&#181;s. Such ultrafast exciton utilization is versatile for OLED applications, including non&#8208;sensitized blue OLED and bi&#8208;color white OLED, rendering excellent EQEmax beyond 30% and suppressed roll&#8208;offs.








ABSTRACT
Narrowband emissive polycyclic aromatic heterocycles (PAHs) featuring multiple resonance thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) are capable of achieving high color purity with high exciton utilization efficiency via reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). However, thermally&#8208;activated RISC remains the rate&#8208;limiting step in MR&#8208;TADF molecules due to the typically large singlet and triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) and weak spin&#8208;orbital coupling. To overcome this challenge, we introduce three carbonyl&#8208;containing organoboron PAHs doped with selenium atoms (pSeXBNO, 1pSeXBN, and pSeXBN) for the first time. Introducing single or dual selenium&#8208;embedded carbonyl heterocycles into the MR core enables significant orbital delocalization of carbonyls, resulting in small &#916;EST and ultrafast RISC rates of 7.5&#160;&#215;&#160;106 s&#8722;1 for pSeXBNO, 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;107 s&#8722;1 for 1pSeXBN, and 4.8&#160;&#215;&#160;107 s&#8722;1 for pSeXBN. The non&#8208;sensitized OLED employing pSeXBN achieves an emission peak at 478&#160;nm with a narrow bandwidth of 28&#160;nm, along with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 32.6% and retaining 28.4% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, representing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance for blue MR&#8208;TADF materials. Moreover, bi&#8208;color white OLED employing pSeXBN exhibits excellent performance with a maximum EQE of 30.9% and 23.2% retained at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. These advances demonstrate the role of carbonyl here is of significant guidance in forwarding narrowband blue materials.

         <title>p&#8208;Benzoyl&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine as a Multifunctional Noncanonical Amino Acid in Synthetic Biology: Photoprobing, Photocatalysis, and Structural Programming for Biocontainment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Benzoyl&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine (pBzF) integrates genetic code expansion with benzophenone photochemistry to enable proximity&#8208;based labeling, programmable biocatalysis, and biosafe microbial engineering, all from a single, site&#8208;specifically encoded amino acid.








ABSTRACT
p&#8208;Benzoyl&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine (pBzF) is a widely used noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) that expands the chemical repertoire of proteins.

         <title>Harnessing Controlled Dealloying&#8211;Support Coupling for Ultrastable PtNi Catalysts in PEMFC Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable alloying&#8211;dealloying strategy constructs PtNi core&#8211;shell nanoparticles confined within an N&#8208;doped carbon framework. Selective ammonia&#8208;assisted dealloying forms a Pt&#8208;rich shell while immobilizing Ni as Ni&#8211;N/C moieties, synergistically stabilizing the catalyst. The resulting structure delivers exceptional ORR activity and durable, high&#8208;power performance in practical PEM fuel cells.








ABSTRACT
Platinum&#8211;transition metal (PtM) alloys are among the most promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, yet their practical deployment in proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is hindered by transition&#8208;metal dissolution, particle coarsening, and insufficient durability. Moreover, conventional alloying or intermetallic ordering strategies often aggravate these issues by inducing severe nanoparticle aggregation and instability. Here we report a controllable alloying&#8211;dealloying strategy to construct PtNi nanoparticles confined in an N&#8208;doped carbon framework (Pt1Ni1&#8208;x@Nix_NC). Ammonia&#8208;assisted dealloying produces a Pt&#8208;rich shell with an alloyed core, while the N&#8208;doped carbon anchors the released Ni atoms form Ni&#8211;N/C moieties, thereby suppressing agglomeration and strengthening metal&#8211;support interactions. This coordination&#8211;support coupling optimizes Pt 5d orbital occupation, weakens oxygen adsorption, and accelerates ORR kinetics. Consequently, Pt1Ni1&#8208;x@Nix_NC exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.932&#160;V and an ultrahigh mass activity of 2.028 A mgPt&#8722;1, which is 8.75&#8208;fold higher than commercial Pt/C and among the best values reported to date for PtNi&#8208;based catalysts. Remarkably, it shows only a 6&#160;mV half&#8208;wave potential loss after 30,000 cycles, demonstrating exceptional durability. In PEMFCs, the fuel cell delivers 975&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 peak power density and retains 91.9% of initial performance, underscoring a generalizable approach for designing durable, high&#8208;performance low&#8208;PGM catalysts for next generation PEMFCs.

         <title>Remote Positioning of Cations Tunes Catalytic Fe&#8208;Mediated Nitrogen Fixation Selectivity for Hydrazine Instead of Ammonia in Protic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanism&#8208;guided design enables selective Fe&#8208;catalyzed N2 reduction to hydrazine in methanol. Incorporating remote cationic (NMe3+) or proton&#8208;responsive (NMe2) groups into a tris(phosphino)borane ligand anodically shifts the redox potential of selectivity determining Fe&#8208;hydrazido species (FeNNH2) to access the reduced state (FeNNH2&#8722;), leading to favorable hydrazine formation over ammonia.








ABSTRACT
Understanding the basis of product selectivity is a central issue in catalyst design. Catalytic nitrogen reduction (N2R) provides a salient example; whereas ammonia (NH3) is the common product of N2R, hydrazine (N2H4) is produced under certain conditions. Using mechanism&#8208;guided design, we report a strategy for tuning redox potential that enables selective reduction of dinitrogen to hydrazine by iron complexes in polar protic media. Incorporation of cationic trimethylammonium (NMe3+) or proton&#8208;responsive dimethylamino (NMe2) groups into a tris(phosphino)borane (P3B) ligand framework affords redox&#8208;tunable iron precatalysts that operate efficiently in methanol. Computational analyses reveal that these ligand modifications anodically shift the reduction potential of an iron hydrazido (Fe&#9552;NNH2) intermediate by &gt;400&#160;mV, thereby influencing the key branch point for hydrazine versus ammonia. Critical to success is positioning the cationic charges remote from the Fe&#8211;N2 binding site to preserve the high degree of N2 activation required for functionalization. Newly prepared tricationic iron complexes, soluble and stable in polar protic media, catalyze N2R with N&#8208;fixed yields of up to 73% per reducing equivalent consumed, and with hydrazine selectivity exceeding 20:1 over ammonia. This work highlights the use of remote electrostatic effects to tune multi&#8208;electron catalytic product profiles from a 6e&#8211; to a 4e&#8211; product.

         <title>Electrooxidative C&#8208;C Fragmentation of Aromatic Radical Cations for Cascade Benzylic Multifunctionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Selective Electrooxidative C&#8208;C Fragmentation of Aromatic Radical Cations for Cascade Benzylic Multifunctionalization by Iterative Dehydrogenation and Oxygenation Was Reported. Central to Our Approach Is the Controlled Formation of Olefin Intermediates in Situ at a Rate Carefully Balanced to Prevent Polymerization and Overoxidation. This Strategy Provides Efficient Access to Diverse, High&#8208;value Di&#8208; or Trifunctionalized Products through Judicious Choice of Acids and Nucleophiles.








ABSTRACT
Oxygen, nitrogen, and halogen&#8208;containing functional groups are ubiquitous in complex small molecules. The installation of multiple carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds by the simultaneous functionalization of contiguous C&#8211;H/C&#8211;C bonds in a selective fashion is highly desirable in polymers degradation, skeletal editing, and petroleum cracking. However, achieving simultaneous, multi&#8208;site functionalization of relatively inert C&#8211;C/C&#8211;H bonds with precise control over site&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and oxidation&#8208;state selectivity remains challenging, particularly due to competing overoxidation and decomposition. Here we report the electrooxidative selective C&#8208;C fragmentation of aromatic radical cations for cascade benzylic di&#8208; and trifunctionalization in simple alkylarenes by iterative dehydrogenation and oxygenation. Central to our approach is the controlled formation of olefin intermediates in situ at a rate carefully balanced to prevent polymerization and overoxidation. This strategy provides efficient access to diverse, high&#8208;value di&#8208; or trifunctionalized products, including di&#8208; and triacetates, 2&#8208;oxazolines, 1,2&#8208;dibromoethanes, 1,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2&#8208;ols, and 2&#8208;(bromomethyl)oxiranes via controlled 4&#8208;electron, 6&#8208;electron, or 10&#8208;electron oxidation events. Notably, the selective synthesis of di&#8208; versus trifunctionalization products is readily controlled through judicious choice of acids and nucleophiles.

         <title>Tuning Redox Behavior of Pyrene&#8211;Benzothiadiazole/TTF&#8211;Based Covalent Organic Framework Electrodes in Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel, highly crystalline 2D PyTTF&#8208;COF, synthesized by integrating n&#8208;type pyrene&#8211;benzothiadiazole (PyBT) and p&#8208;type tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) subunits via an n&#8208;type imine linkage, yielding a bipolar electrode capable of reversible 16&#160;e&#8722; dual cation&#8211;anion storage. This study elucidates the intricate interdependence between the structural architecture of the COF and the electrolyte environment, which collectively govern the electrochemical behavior of the bipolar&#8208;type COF electrode and, consequently, the overall rate&#8208;performance of the dual&#8208;ion batteries. 








ABSTRACT
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising electrode materials for secondary&#8208;ion batteries, where redox&#8208;active building blocks and linkages enable tunable redox properties, while ordered pores serve as nanochannels for fast ion transport. We report a novel highly crystalline 2D PyTTF&#8208;COF, synthesized by integrating n&#8208;type pyrene&#8211;benzothiadiazole (PyBT) and p&#8208;type tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) subunits via an n&#8208;type imine linkage, yielding a bipolar electrode capable of reversible 16&#160;e&#8722; dual cation&#8211;anion storage.

Electrochemical evaluation in Li&#8208;ion half cells revealed a wide electrochemical window of 0.1&#8722;3.6&#160;V vs. Li/Li+, with markedly enhanced charge&#8208;storage kinetics and ion diffusion with LiTFSI relative to LiPF6 electrolytes. The PyTTF electrode delivered specific capacities of 286&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 (LiTFSI) and 184&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 (LiPF6) at 0.3&#160;A g&#8722;1, highlighting the strong influence of anion identity. Systematic variation of LiTFSI salt concentration (1&#8722;3&#160;&#1084;) revealed strong correlations between electrolyte composition, ion storage dynamics, and interfacial charge&#8208;transfer resistance. This study highlights, for the first time, the critical importance of tailoring both charge&#8208;carrier identity and electrolyte concentration to unlock the full potential of bipolar COF electrodes for dual&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising electrode materials for secondary-ion batteries, where redox-active building blocks and linkages enable tunable redox properties, while ordered pores serve as nanochannels for fast ion transport. We report a novel highly crystalline 2D PyTTF-COF, synthesized by integrating &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-type pyrene&#8211;benzothiadiazole (PyBT) and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-type tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) subunits via an &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-type imine linkage, yielding a bipolar electrode capable of reversible 16&#160;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; dual cation&#8211;anion storage.

         <title>Surface&#8208;State&#8211;Regulated Product Distribution in Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation Over MXene&#8208;Based S&#8208;Scheme Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work establishes an MXene&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme heterojunction in which the cooperative interplay among metallic Ni, surface NiOx domains, and conductive Ti3C2Clx drives efficient charge separation and photothermal coupling. Progressive evolution of Ni surface states regulates the CH4/CH3OH product distribution by modulating interfacial energetics and hydrogenation pathways, enabling effective photothermal CO2 conversion.








ABSTRACT
The rational design of heterostructured photocatalysts that simultaneously enable efficient carrier separation, photothermal synergy, and controllable reaction pathways is crucial for advancing CO2 conversion. Here, a Ni/Ti3C2Clx MXene heterojunction is synthesized via Lewis acid molten&#8208;salt etching, featuring ultrathin Ni platelets strongly anchored to the MXene substrate through interfacial TiNi3 bonding. This architecture establishes an S&#8208;scheme charge transfer pathway, as evidenced by in situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, which confirm efficient carrier transfer and separation, while femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveals ultrafast interfacial dynamics. Under photothermal conditions, the cooperative interplay of metallic Ni, surface NiOx, and the conductive MXene substrate couples directional charge migration with thermally assisted molecular activation and barrier lowering, thereby enabling regulated CO2 hydrogenation product distribution between CH4 and CH3OH. Density functional theory demonstrates that surface&#8208;state evolution, rather than simple oxidation degree, modulates adsorption energetics and alters the relative barriers of CH4 and CH3OH pathways, such that moderately oxidized Ni&#8211;NiOx interfacial ensembles favour methanol forming intermediates, whereas extensive oxidation suppresses CH3OH formation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a robust strategy for exploiting MXene&#8208;based heterojunction interfaces in photothermal catalysis and underscore the pivotal role of surface state regulated reaction pathways in steering product distribution during CO2 hydrogenation.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;One&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Single Crystals Enabling Decoupled Ionic&#8211;Electronic Transport for Sensitive and Stable X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through rational perovskite structural design, a novel quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional perovskite was developed featuring five&#8208;layer&#8208;thick inorganic chain inorganic chains, enabling efficient carrier transport and suppressed ion migration. The polymer&#8211;perovskite approach provides a reliable connection between the tablet and the thin&#8208;film transistor, resulting in sensitive and stable x&#8208;ray detection and imaging.








ABSTRACT
Metal halide perovskites are promising candidates for low&#8208;cost and sensitive x&#8208;ray detection. However, the existing perovskite materials with diverse composition and dimensionality encounter an intrinsictrade&#8208;off between carrier collection and ion migration, posing a critical challenge for high&#8208;energy x&#8208;ray detection. Here, we demonstrated that the quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional perovskite of cystamine lead iodide featuring corner&#8208;sharing [Pb5I22] chains chain and small interchain spacing along edge&#8208;on orientation enables efficient carrier collection and blocked ion migration simultaneously, and thus largely decouple the electronic and ionic transport pathways. The as&#8208;grown single crystals yield a large mobility&#8208;lifetime product of 4.35&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 cm2 V&#8722;1, and a high activation energy for ion migration of 0.94&#160;eV. Therefore, an impressive x&#8208;ray sensitivity of 1.42&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;&#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 (average x&#8208;ray energy 42.7&#160;keV) are obtained in quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional perovskite. Under harsh conditions, such as continuous radiation, high electric fields, and high temperatures, the device exhibits excellent operational stability. As a proof of concept, the robust integration of a quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional perovskite with a thin&#8208;film transistor backplane for x&#8208;ray imaging was achieved. This study offers innovative insights into the regulate the structural dimensions of materials for sensitive and stable x&#8208;ray detection.

         <title>Efficient Removal of Short&#8208;Chain Perfluoroalkyl Substances by Cavity&#8208;Directed Aggregation in a Molecular Cage Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular cage exhibits strong entropy&#8208;driven encapsulation of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), accommodating up to four short&#8208;chain guests as anionic aggregates. Guided by these molecular&#8208;level insights, a novel host&#8208;in&#8208;host adsorbent is developed: mesoporous silica doped with 1 wt% cage achieves &gt;98% removal of short&#8208; and long&#8208;chain PFAS with full regenerability under flow&#8208;through conditions.








ABSTRACT
The removal of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from water is critical to protect human health and the environment. However, removing short&#8208;chain PFAS remains a significant challenge, and a molecular&#8208;level understanding of their binding is lacking. Here, we utilise a metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC 1) as a model &#8220;pore&#8221; to elucidate the host&#8208;guest chemistry of short&#8208; and long&#8208;chain PFAS in water. X&#8208;ray crystallography of six 1&#183;(PFAS)n complexes reveals a broad range of PFAS are encapsulated as anionic aggregates, with the degree of guest&#8208;guest aggregation decreasing as the fluoroalkyl chain length increases. 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy, together with isothermal titration calorimetry reveal the cage host displays unusually large, entropy&#8208;driven association constants in water (log K &#8805; &#8197;5) which remain high for short&#8208;chain PFAS. Doping mesoporous silica 60A with only &#8764;1 wt% of the cage results in a host&#8208;in&#8208;host adsorbent that removes &gt;98% of short&#8208; and long&#8208;chain PFAS at environmentally relevant concentrations under flow&#8208;through conditions. The adsorbent exhibits rapid PFAS uptake with high selectivity over common water&#8208;borne anions and full regenerability. These findings translate host&#8208;guest chemistry into an effective materials platform for PFAS remediation, including short&#8208;chain species that evade conventional removal methods.

&lt;p&gt;The removal of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from water is critical to protect human health and the environment. However, removing short-chain PFAS remains a significant challenge, and a molecular-level understanding of their binding is lacking. Here, we utilise a metal-organic cage (MOC &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) as a model &#8220;pore&#8221; to elucidate the host-guest chemistry of short- and long-chain PFAS in water. X-ray crystallography of six &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#183;(PFAS)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; complexes reveals a broad range of PFAS are encapsulated as anionic aggregates, with the degree of guest-guest aggregation decreasing as the fluoroalkyl chain length increases. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR spectroscopy, together with isothermal titration calorimetry reveal the cage host displays unusually large, entropy-driven association constants in water (log &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; &#8805; &#8197;5) which remain high for short-chain PFAS. Doping mesoporous silica 60A with only &#8764;1 wt% of the cage results in a host-in-host adsorbent that removes &amp;gt;98% of short- and long-chain PFAS at environmentally relevant concentrations under flow-through conditions. The adsorbent exhibits rapid PFAS uptake with high selectivity over common water-borne anions and full regenerability. These findings translate host-guest chemistry into an effective materials platform for PFAS remediation, including short-chain species that evade conventional removal methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifaceted Molecular Design Enables Comprehensive Luminescence Modulation in Metalloligand&#8208;Stabilized Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tridentate phosphine ligand (NP3) was employed for the first time in the synthesis of metalloligand&#8208;stabilized coinage metal nanoclusters with an unprecedented multi&#8208;sphere configuration of &#8220;Au9M4 (M = Au or Cu) icosahedron + Au3 crown&#8221;. Multifaceted regulation of TADF properties and emission performance was achieved both experimentally and theoretically through Cu&#8208;doping, ligand modification, and coordinating anion substitution. These nanoclusters further exhibit proton&#8208;responsive reversible photoluminescence modulation with protonation&#8208;induced enhancement and deprotonation&#8208;induced quenching.








ABSTRACT
Photoluminescent metal nanoclusters hold promise for optoelectronics, photonics, and chemosensing, yet systematic modulation of their emission within a single system remains challenging. Here, we report two isostructural clusters, Au13@Au3&#8208;Cl and Au9Cu4@Au3&#8208;Cl, stabilized by a tridentate phosphine (NP3) metalloligand. Both adopt an unprecedented &#8220;Au9M4 (Au/Cu) icosahedron + Au3 crown&#8221; configuration and exhibit high solid&#8208;state PLQYs of 44.5% and 38.9%, respectively. In contrast, replacing NP3 with a monophosphine ligand (BPP) affords Au9Cu4&#8208;Cl lacking the Au3 crown, with a dramatically reduced PLQY of 0.6%, highlighting the crucial roles of NP3 and the Au3 crown in boosting luminescence. Distinct photophysical behaviors are observed: Au13@Au3&#8208;Cl shows phosphorescence, while Au9Cu4@Au3&#8208;Cl exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), confirmed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The role of Cu doping is further supported by the TADF activity of Au9Cu4&#8208;Cl. Coordinating anion substitution also modulates emission, with iodide promoting TADF in Au13@Au3&#8208;I. Moreover, the NP3 ligand confers reversible protonation&#8208;induced luminescence switching, enabling chemosensing potential. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a comprehensive investigation of TADF behavior and luminescence modulation in atomically precise metal nanoclusters, systematically engineered through heteroatom doping of the inner core, ligand design and anion exchange at the coordination surface, and outer&#8208;sphere complexation and protonation.

         <title>Metal Node Guided Pore Engineering in Carborane&#8208;Based MOFs for Efficient C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal node guided pore engineering strategy in carborane&#8208;based MOFs was developed, leading to the creation of Co&#8208;CB&#8208;HPBTA with partitioned dual cage system for efficient C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 separations.








ABSTRACT
The efficient separation of C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 mixtures is essential for the preparation of high&#8208;purity C2H2 and C2H4, but challenged by the trade&#8208;off between the capacity and selectivity. In this work, we report a node guided pore engineering strategy in carborane&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), leading to the partitioned dual cage system in Co&#8208;CB&#8208;HPBTA in contrast to its analogue Zn&#8208;CB&#8208;HPBTA with one&#8208;dimensional channels. This structural evolution endows Co&#8208;CB&#8208;HPBTA with a high C2H2 adsorption capacity of 103.2 cm3/g (4.61 mmol/g) at 298 K and 1 bar, along with superior selectivity for C2H2/CO2 (10.6) and C2H2/C2H4 (13.3). Breakthrough experiments confirm its excellent separation performance for both mixtures under varied conditions, demonstrating efficient recovery of high&#8208;purity C2H2 and C2H4 with remarkable cyclic stability and humidity tolerance. The separation mechanism is elucidated by DFT calculations and in situ single&#8208;crystal&#8208;ray diffraction, which reveal enhanced binding interactions within the partitioned cages through multiple van der Waals contacts, rationalizing the high selectivity.

         <title>Influence of Positional Isomerism in Weakly Solvating Ethers on Lithium Metal Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that Li&#8208;ion electrolytes with asymmetric ethers exhibit faster charge&#8208;transfer kinetics at negatievely polarized interfaces than symmetric ethers with similar Carbon/Oxygen ratios. This arises from a tilted dipole and conformational changes that reduce solvation shielding and ease Li+ transfer. In contrast, Li metal deposition favors symmetric ethers and scales linearly with ion pairing and LiF, not Li2O in the SEI.








ABSTRACT
Lithium metal is a promising anode for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries but faces issues like internal short circuits and low Coulombic efficiency (CE), limiting its performance. Although factors like solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) composition, charge transfer resistance, solvation structure, and solvent symmetry influence Li metal deposition, a unified descriptor remains absent. Here, we systematically investigate three positional isomers of weakly solvating ether solvents&#8212;dipropyl ether (DPE), butyl ethyl ether (BEE), and pentyl methyl ether (PME), selected to maintain the same C/O (carbon/oxygen) ratio of 6, allowing isolation of minor structural variations on Li metal deposition. By correlating charge transfer kinetics, solvation structure, SEI composition, and lithium microstructure with electrochemical performance, we identify key factors influencing deposition. The symmetric ether, DPE, with sluggish charge transfer kinetics and the most pronounced ion pairing, achieved the highest CE of 99.26%, followed by BEE (99.24%) and PME (98.89%). Increased ion pairing and enhanced LiF content in the SEI were found to have the strongest linear correlation with interfacial stability as reflected in CE. These findings challenge previous studies that faster charge transfer kinetics led to improved CE and enhance the understanding of designing weakly solvating ethers with optimized oxygen placement for future Li metal batteries.

         <title>Asymmetric Electrolytes Govern Tetrahydroxozincate Dynamics for Stable Alkaline Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research tackles the limitations of alkaline zinc batteries by designing a series of metalloporphyrin molecules (Co&#8208;4N, Co&#8208;3N&#8208;O, Co&#8208;3N&#8208;S) as electrolyte additives. The asymmetric structures, particularly Co&#8208;3N&#8208;O, accelerate the Zn(OH)42&#8722; decomposition via a modulated metal center and control Zn2+ transport through carboxyl groups. This approach enables the stable cycles of 80,000 s at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. It demonstrates a molecular solution to challenges in aqueous battery chemistry. 








ABSTRACT
Green electrochemical energy storage is essential for carbon neutrality, and alkaline zinc batteries offer a compelling solution due to their inherent safety, low cost, and high energy density. However, their performance is limited by parasitic reactions, including corrosion, gas evolution, and slow Zn/ZnO conversion kinetics stemming from inefficient dissociation of the tetrahydroxozincate [Zn(OH)42&#8722;] intermediate. We address this by designing a series of cobalt porphyrins (Co&#8208;4N, Co&#8208;3N&#8208;O, Co&#8208;3N&#8208;S) that modulate the metal center's charge density for accelerating Zn(OH)42&#8722; decomposition, and control Zn2+ transport through the carboxyl&#8208;functionalized peripheries. The Co&#8208;3N&#8208;O&#8208;modified electrolyte achieves exceptional stability, maintaining stable cycle for over 80,000 s at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is more than four times longer than the &lt;20,000 s achieved by the conventional KOH + ZnO electrolyte. In Zn||Ni batteries, this molecularly engineered electrolyte enables 110 stable cycles at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, significantly outperforming the unmodified system, which sustained only 20 cycles.

&lt;p&gt;This research tackles the limitations of alkaline zinc batteries by designing a series of metalloporphyrin molecules (Co-4N, Co-3N-O, Co-3N-S) as electrolyte additives. The asymmetric structures, particularly Co-3N-O, accelerate the Zn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; decomposition via a modulated metal center and control Zn&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport through carboxyl groups. This approach enables the stable cycles of 80,000 s at 5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It demonstrates a molecular solution to challenges in aqueous battery chemistry. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green electrochemical energy storage is essential for carbon neutrality, and alkaline zinc batteries offer a compelling solution due to their inherent safety, low cost, and high energy density. However, their performance is limited by parasitic reactions, including corrosion, gas evolution, and slow Zn/ZnO conversion kinetics stemming from inefficient dissociation of the tetrahydroxozincate [Zn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;] intermediate. We address this by designing a series of cobalt porphyrins (Co-4N, Co-3N-O, Co-3N-S) that modulate the metal center's charge density for accelerating Zn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; decomposition, and control Zn&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport through the carboxyl-functionalized peripheries. The Co-3N-O-modified electrolyte achieves exceptional stability, maintaining stable cycle for over 80,000 s at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is more than four times longer than the &amp;lt;20,000 s achieved by the conventional KOH + ZnO electrolyte. In Zn||Ni batteries, this molecularly engineered electrolyte enables 110 stable cycles at 1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, significantly outperforming the unmodified system, which sustained only 20 cycles. These findings elucidate a structure-kinetics relationship for zincate regulation and demonstrate how customized molecular asymmetry can overcome persistent challenges in aqueous battery chemistry, offering a pathway to high-performance, durable energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Meltable Semiconductive Lead&#8211;Thiolate Coordination Polymers with Long Alkyl Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first meltable semiconducting Pb(II)&#8208;benzenethiolate coordination polymer, KGF&#8208;34(C6). It exhibits higher charge mobility, a narrower bandgap, and greater band dispersion than classical Pb(II)&#8208;alkanethiolate coordination polymers. Furthermore, KGF&#8208;34(C6) melts, enabling melt&#8208;processed optoelectronic devices.








ABSTRACT
Meltable organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid semiconductors are attractive for their potential for melt&#8208;based processing. Although meltable semiconducting metal halide perovskites have been extensively studied, meltable semiconducting coordination polymers (CPs) remain scarce, despite their excellent structural designability and the tunability of their optoelectronic properties. We report a new family of meltable semiconductive Pb(II) benzenethiolate CPs bearing long alkyl chains, formulated as [Pb(SPhOC6)2]n (KGF&#8208;34(C6); HSPhOC6 = 4&#8208;hexyloxybenzenethiol). For comparison, we also synthesized the classical analogue [Pb(SC6)2]n (KGF&#8208;59(C6); HSC6 = 1&#8208;hexanethiol). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses revealed that both KGF&#8208;34(C6) and KGF&#8208;59(C6) adopt 2D architectures, albeit with distinct inorganic (&#8211;Pb&#8211;S&#8211;)n networks. A comprehensive characterization of the semiconducting properties, combined with first&#8208;principles calculations, revealed that KGF&#8208;34(C6) exhibits significantly higher photoconductivity, a narrower band gap, and a larger band dispersion than KGF&#8208;59(C6), attributable to differences in their inorganic (&#8211;Pb&#8211;S&#8211;)n network structures. Furthermore, both KGF&#8208;34(C6) and KGF&#8208;59(C6) exhibit multiple phase transitions, including melting and liquid crystalline formation, enabling the fabrication of optoelectronic devices via melt processing. Notably, this is the first report of meltable semiconducting CPs comprising benzenethiol&#8208;derived ligands. These findings offer a rational design strategy for developing melt&#8208;processable semiconductive materials based on metal&#8211;benzenethiolate CPs.

         <title>A Mechanochemical Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt Reaction: Catechol Carboxylation Provides Building Blocks for Renewable Plasticizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt reaction of disodium catecholate enables the synthesis of mono&#8208; and dicarboxylated catechols at low temperature and CO2 pressure. Directly derivatizing the resulting carboxylic acid and phenolic moieties in the obtained mixture provides plasticizer blends with efficiencies competitive to commercial benchmarks.








ABSTRACT
Catechol, an important aromatic platform molecule which can be derived from biomass, was carboxylated by mechanochemical Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt reaction of disodium catecholate with CO2, providing a mixture of mono&#8208; and dicarboxylated catechol derivatives. While classical protocols require harsh reaction conditions, involving a high temperature and/or CO2 pressure, a mild ball milling method was developed. This represents the first mechanochemical Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt reaction featuring a low CO2 pressure and reactivity at room temperature. From the individual catechol&#8208;based mono&#8208; and dicarboxylic acid reaction products, a library of novel renewable plasticizers was synthesized through esterification of the carboxylic acid functionalities and O&#8208;acylation of the phenolic hydroxy groups. The resulting esters were evaluated in poly(vinylchloride) (PVC) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA), revealing plasticizing efficiencies competitive to benchmark commercial plasticizers. These efficiencies were maintained when the best performing ester substitution pattern was installed on the ball mill&#8208;derived mixture of mono&#8208; and dicarboxylated catechols, making resource intensive separation (e.g. chromatographic separation) of these ortho&#8208;dihydroxybenzene(di)carboxylic acids redundant.

         <title>Supramolecular Nanoconfinement&#8208;Accelerated Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Styrenic Polymers Boosting Proton Conductivity in Nafion&#8208;doped Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents a bilayer self&#8208;assembly strategy inspired by phospholipid bilayers to synthesize functional freestanding 2D covalent polymers, demonstrating enhanced mechanical and proton conduction properties when incorporated into Nafion membranes for improved fuel cell performance.








ABSTRACT
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent polymers offer environmental stability, surface area, and mechanical resilience, but preparation of functional, freestanding 2D polymers remains challenging. Inspired by phospholipid bilayers, we developed a bilayer self&#8208;assembly strategy for 2D covalent polymer synthesis with tailored functionalized surface. Ionic amphiphilic styrene monomers employ intramolecular face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking, inducing a folded monomer conformation that achieves a critical packing parameter near unity. This drives 2D nanosheet formation in basic aqueous solution. Concurrent electrostatic repulsion enabled spontaneous exfoliation. In situ radical polymerization within preorganized framework, accelerated by nanoconfinement effect, converted supramolecular assemblies into covalent bilayer polymers with 95% monomer conversion. Incorporating sulfonic acid&#8208;functionalized 2D polymers (0.66&#160;wt%) into Nafion D2020 membrane enhanced mechanical strength and proton conductivity at room temperature. Fuel cell testing (70&#176;C, 100% RH) demonstrated increased open&#8208;circuit voltage (1.00&#160;V vs. 0.96&#160;V), suppressed hydrogen permeation, elevated peak power density (678.9&#160;vs. 454.6 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2), and reduced ohmic resistance (25.2&#160;vs. 55.1&#160;m&#937;).
