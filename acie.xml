         <title>Asymmetric Dearomatization of Indoles through Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Functionalization Enabled by Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis holds a pivotal position in modern organic synthesis, capable of inducing novel reactivities under mild and environmentally friendly reaction conditions. However, the merger of photocatalysis and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation as an efficient and sustainable method for the construction of chiral molecules remains elusive and challenging. Herein, we develop a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation reaction enabled by visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis, providing a synergistic catalytic strategy for the asymmetric dearomatization of indoles with high levels of enantioselectivity (96% to &gt;99% ee). Mechanistic studies indicate that the excited photocatalyst was quenched by divalent cobalt species in the presence of Salox ligand, leading to the formation of catalytically active chiral Co(III) complex. Moreover, stoichiometric reactions of cobaltacycle intermediate with indole suggest that the irradiation of visible light also play a critical role in the dearomatization step.</dc:description>

         <title>General In Situ Engineering of Carbon&#8208;Based Materials on Carbon Fiber for In Vivo Neurochemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing real&#8208;time, dynamic, and in situ analytical methods with high spatial and temporal resolutions is crucial for exploring biochemical processes in the brain. Although in vivo electrochemical methods based on carbon fiber (CF) microelectrodes are effective in monitoring neurochemical dynamics during physiological and pathological processes, complex post modification hinders large&#8208;scale productions and widespread neuroscience applications. Herein, we develop a general strategy for the in situ engineering of carbon&#8208;based materials to mass&#8208;produce functional CFs by introducing polydopamine to anchor zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as precursors, followed by one&#8208;step pyrolysis. This strategy demonstrates exceptional universality and design flexibility, overcoming complex post&#8208;modification procedures and avoiding the delamination of the modification layer. This simplifies the fabrication and integration of functional CF&#8208;based microelectrodes. Moreover, we design highly stable and selective H+, O2, and ascorbate microsensors and monitor the influence of CO2 exposure on the O2 content of the cerebral tissue during physiological and ischemia&#8208;reperfusion pathological processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;Doping Enables Significant Suppression of Conformational Relaxation and Intermolecular Nonradiative Decay for Improved Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite various efforts to optimize the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) performance of perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives for bio&#8208;imaging, convenient and efficient strategies to amplify the fluorescence of PDI derivatives in biological environment and the intrinsic mechanism studies are still lacking. Herein, we propose an alkyl&#8208;doping strategy to amplify the fluorescence of PDI derivative&#8208;based nanoparticles for improved NIR fluorescence imaging. The developed PDI derivative, OPE&#8208;PDI, shows much brighter in n&#8208;Hexane (HE) compared with that in other organic media, and the excited state dynamics investigation experimentally elucidates the solvent effect&#8208;induced suppression of intermolecular energy transfer and intramolecular nonradiative decay as the underlying mechanism for the fluorescence improvement. Theoretical calculations reveal the lowest reorganization energies of OPE&#8208;PDI in HE among various solvents, indicating the effectively suppressed conformational relaxation to support the strongest radiative decay. Inspired by this, an alkyl atmosphere mimicking HE is constructed by incorporating the octadecane into OPE&#8208;PDI&#8208;based nanoparticles, permitting up to 3&#8208;fold fluorescence improvement compared with the counterpart nanoparticles. Owing to the merits of high brightness, anti&#8208;photobleaching, and low biotoxicity for the optimal nanoparticles, they have been employed for probing and long&#8208;term monitoring of tumor. This work highlights a facile strategy for the fluorescence enhancement of PDI derivative&#8208;based nanoparticles.</dc:description>

Herein, we propose an alkyl-doping strategy to amplify the fluorescence of PDI derivative-based nanoparticles for improved NIR fluorescence imaging. The developed PDI derivative, OPE-PDI, shows much brighter in n-Hexane (HE) compared with that in other organic media, and the excited state dynamics investigation experimentally elucidates the solvent effect-induced suppression of intermolecular energy transfer and intramolecular nonradiative decay as the underlying mechanism for the fluorescence improvement.

         <title>Hirocidins, Cytotoxic Metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis, Induce Mitochondrion&#8208;mediated Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances in whole genome sequencing have revealed an immense microbial potential for the production of therapeutic small molecules, even from well&#8208;known producers. To access this potential, we subjected prominent antimicrobial producers to alternative antiproliferative assays using persistent cancer cell lines. Described herein is our discovery of hirocidins, novel secondary metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis with antiproliferative activities against colon and persistent breast cancer cells. Hirocidin A is an unusual nine&#8208;membered carbocyclic maleimide and hirocidins B and C are relatives with an unprecedented, bridged azamacrocyclic backbone. Mode of action studies show that hirocidins trigger mitochondrion&#8208;dependent apoptosis by inducing expression of the key apoptotic effector caspase&#8208;9. The discovery of new cytotoxins contributes to scaffold diversification in anticancer drug discovery and the reported modes of action and concise total synthetic route for variant A set the stage for unraveling specific targets and biochemical interactions of the hirocidins.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Solid Polymer Layer: From a Single Fluoropolymer to Divergent Fluorinated Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the structure and chemistry of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) underpins the stability of electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface, and is crucial for advancing rechargeable lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we utilized photo&#8208;controlled copolymerization to achieve the on&#8208;demand synthesis of fluorosulfonyl fluoropolymers as unprecedented artificial SEI layers on Li metal anodes. This work not only enables instant formation of a hybrid polymer&#8208;inorganic interphase that consists of a polymer&#8208;enriched top layer and a LiF&#8208;fortified bottom layer, originating from a single polymeric component, but also imparts various desirable physical properties (e.g., good mechanical strength and flexibility, high ion conductivity, low overpotential) to SEI via a single&#8208;to&#8208;divergent strategy. Model reactions and structural characterizations supported the formation of a divergent fluorinated interphase, which furnished prolonged stabilization of Li deposition, high coulombic efficiency and improved cycling behavior in electrochemical experiments. This work highlights the great potential of exploring reactive polymers as versatile coatings to stabilize Li metal anodes, providing a promising avenue to solve electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial problems for LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Deuteration as a General Strategy to Enhance Azobenzene&#8208;Based Photopharmacology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical photoswitches have become a widely used approach for the remote control of biological functions with spatiotemporal precision. Several molecular scaffolds have been implemented to improve photoswitch characteristics, ranging from the nature of the photoswitch itself (e.g. azobenzenes, dithienylethenes, hemithioindigo) to fine&#8208;tuning of aromatic units and substituents. Herein, we present deuterated azobenzene photoswitches as a general means of enhancing the performance of photopharmacological molecules. Deuteration can improve azobenzene performance in terms of light sensitivity (higher molar extinction coefficient), photoswitch efficiency (higher photoisomerization quantum yield), and photoswitch kinetics (faster macroscopic rate of photoisomerization) with minimal alteration to the underlying structure of the photopharmacological ligand. We report synthesized deuterated azobenzene&#8208;based ligands for the optimized optical control of ion channel and G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) function in live cells, setting the stage for the straightforward, widespread adoption of this approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Electron Push&#8208;Pull Effect for Catalytic Polymerization and Degradation of a Cyclobutane Monomer System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations guide to unveil the electron push&#8208;pull effect in reshaping the polymerizability of non&#8208;polymerizable cyclobutane to afford densely functionalized all&#8208;carbon main&#8208;chain polymers, as well as their degradation to afford alkene derivatives. Successful polymerization conditions consist of Lewis acid, Br&#248;nsted base, and a C(sp3)&#8208;H initiator, while degradation proceeds with catalytic amount of an acid.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) offers a striking solution to solve problems encountered in step&#8208;growth condensation polymerization, including precise control over molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and topology. This has inspired our interest in ROP of cycloalkanes with an ultimate goal to rethink polyolefins, which clearly poses a number of challenges. Practicality of ROP of cycloalkanes is actually limited by their low polymerizability and elusive mechanisms which arise from significantly varied ring size and non&#8208;polar C&#8722;C bonds in monomers. In this work, by using Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted base/C(sp3)&#8208;H initiator system previously developed in our laboratory, we focus on cyclobutanes and explore the positional and electronic effects of substituents on the ring, namely electron push&#8208;pull effect, in promoting controlled polymerization to afford densely functionalized poly(cyclobutanes), as well as catalytic degradation of obtained polymers for upcycling. More importantly, experiments and DFT calculations unveil considerable population of Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;induced thermostabilized 1,4&#8208;zwitterions, which distinguish cyclobutanes from cyclopropanes and others. All these findings would shed light on catalytic synthesis and degradation of saturated all&#8208;carbon main&#8208;chain polymers, as well as small molecule transformations of cyclobutanes.

         <title>A Stable Chichibabin Diradicaloid with Near&#8208;Infrared Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable analogue of the iconic Chichibabin hydrocarbon was synthesized by Ullmann coupling from a readily available, chlorinated trityl radical (TTM&#8208;I). Thanks to its planar bridge, which exhibits hydrogen and chlorine atoms in just the right positions, the TTM&#8208;TTM diradicaloid has skyblue color in solution, emits in the NIR range but nevertheless has significant diradical character at room temperature.







Abstract
Conjugated molecules with multiple radical centers such as the iconic Chichibabin diradicaloid hold promise as building blocks in materials for quantum sensing and quantum information processing. However, it is a considerable challenge to design simple analogues of the Chichibabin hydrocarbon that are chemically inert, exhibit high diradical character and emit light at a distinct wavelength that may offer an optical readout of the spin state in functional ensembles. Here we describe the serendipitous discovery of the stable TTM&#8208;TTM diradicaloid, which exhibits high diradical character, a striking sky&#8208;blue color and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission (in solution). This combination of properties is unique among related diradicaloids and is due to the presence of hydrogen and chlorine atoms in &#8220;just the right positions&#8221;, allowing a perfectly planar, yet predominantly benzenoid bridge to connect the two sterically stabilized radical centers. In&#8208;depth studies of the optical and magnetic properties suggest that this structural motif could become a mainstay building block of organic spin materials.

         <title>A Bioorthogonal Dual Fluorogenic Probe for the Live&#8208;Cell Monitoring of Nutrient Uptake by Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wang, Torres et&#8197;al. describe a probe for the live cell monitoring of nutrient uptake by Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. By dually quenching a CFSE&#8208;probe that becomes fluorogenic after treatment with cytosolic esterases, and fluorescent upon reaction with strained alkenes, they could monitor uptake of fatty acids, sugars, and amino acids in primary immune cells.







Abstract
Cells rely heavily on the uptake of exogenous nutrients for survival, growth, and differentiation. Yet quantifying the uptake of small molecule nutrients at the single cell level is difficult. Here we present a new approach to studying the nutrient uptake in live single cells using Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels Alder (IEDDA) chemistry. We have modified carboxyfluorescein&#8208;diacetate&#8208;succinimidyl esters (CFSE)&#8212;a quenched fluorophore that can covalently react with proteins and is only turned on in the cytosol of a cell following esterase activity&#8212;with a tetrazine. This tetrazine serves as a second quencher for the pendant fluorophore. Upon reaction with nutrients modified with an electron&#8208;rich or strained dienophile in an IEDDA reaction, this quenching group is destroyed, thereby enabling the probe to fluoresce. This has allowed us to monitor the uptake of a variety of dienophile&#8208;containing nutrients in live primary immune cell populations using flow cytometry and live&#8208;cell microscopy.

         <title>Surface Coordination Modulated Morphological Anisotropic Engineering of Iron&#8208;Benzoquinone Frameworks for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulation of the surface coordination of carbon for morphological engineering of Fe&#8208;THBQ is realized, the morphology of which evolves from thermodynamically favored truncated cube to cuboctahedron depending on the content of O&#8208;containing functional groups on carbon substrate. It exhibits facet&#8208;dependent performance for lithium storage.







Abstract
Morphological anisotropic engineering is powerful to synthesize metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with versatile physicochemical properties for diverse applications ranging from gas storage/separation to electrocatalysis and batteries, etc. Herein, we developed a carbon substrate guided strategy to manipulate the facet&#8208;dependent coordination for morphology engineering of Fe&#8208;THBQ (tetrahydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone) frameworks, which is built with cubic Fe octamer bridged by two parallel THBQ ligands along three orthogonal axes, extending to a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) framework with pcu&#8208;e network topology. The electronegative O&#8208;containing functional groups on carbon surfaces compete with THBQ linkers to selectively interact with the unsaturated coordinated Fe cations on the {111} facets and inhibit crystal growth along the &lt;111&gt; direction. The morphology of Fe&#8208;THBQ evolves from thermodynamically favored truncated cube to cuboctahedron depending on the content of O&#8208;containing functional groups on the carbon substrate. The Fe&#8208;THBQ with varied morphologies exhibits facet&#8208;dependent performances for electrochemical lithium storage. This work will shed light on the morphology modulation of MOFs for promising applications.

         <title>Progressive Optimization of Lanthanide Nanoparticle Scintillators for Enhanced Triple&#8208;Activated Radioluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A progressive optimization on lanthanide nanoparticle (LnNP) scintillators was performed to maximize their radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL) emission intensity and reveal the underlying relationship between the scintillators&#8242; structure and RL efficiency. The results regarding the RL mechanism and in vivo multimodal imaging strongly indicated the significant potential of tailored LnNP scintillators to achieve seamlessly integrated tumor radio&#8208;phototheranostics.







Abstract
Lanthanide nanoparticle (LnNP) scintillators exhibit huge potential in achieving radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (radioluminescence, RL). However, their structure&#8211;activity relationship remains largely unexplored. Herein, progressive optimization of LnNP scintillators is presented to unveil their structure&#8208;dependent RL property and enhance their RL output efficiency. Benefiting from the favorable host matrix and the luminescence&#8208;protective effect of core&#8211;shell engineering, NaGdF4&#8201;:&#8201;15&#8201;%Eu@NaLuF4 nanoparticle scintillators with tailored structures emerged as the top candidates. Living imaging experiments based on optimal LnNP scintillators validated the feasibility of laser&#8208;free continuous RL activated by clinical radiopharmaceuticals for tumor multiplex visualization. This research provides unprecedented insights into the rational design of LnNP scintillators, which would enable efficient energy conversion from Cerenkov luminescence, &#947;&#8208;radiation, and &#946;&#8208;electrons into visible photon signals, thus establishing a robust nanotechnology&#8208;aided approach for tumor&#8208;directed radio&#8208;phototheranostics.

         <title>Ultrafast Formation of Charge Transfer Trions at Molecular&#8208;Functionalized 2D MoS2 Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trion dynamics at an organometallic molecule/monolayer molybdenum disulfide (ML&#8722;MoS2) is investigated via transient electronic sum frequency generation (tr&#8208;ESFG) spectroscopy. We observed an ultrafast hole transfer, followed by the formation of charge&#8208;transfer trions.







Abstract
In this work, we investigate trion dynamics occurring at the heterojunction between organometallic molecules and a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) with transient electronic sum frequency generation (tr&#8208;ESFG) spectroscopy. By pumping at 2.4&#8197;eV with laser pulses, we have observed an ultrafast hole transfer, succeeded by the emergence of charge&#8208;transfer trions. This observation is facilitated by the cancellation of ground state bleach and stimulated emission signals due to their opposite phases, making tr&#8208;ESFG especially sensitive to the trion formation dynamics. The presence of charge&#8208;transfer trion at molecular functionalized TMD monolayers suggests the potential for engineering the local electronic structures and dynamics of specific locations on TMDs and offers a potential for transferring unique electronic attributes of TMD to the molecular layers.

         <title>Indium Tin Oxide Induced Internal Positive Feedback and Indium Ion Transport in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction between perovskite decomposition products and indium tin oxide substrate triggers positive feedback cycle and deteriorates the stability of perovskite solar cell.







Abstract
Stability is the most pressing challenge hindering the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and previous efforts focused more on enhancing the resistance of PSCs to external stimulus. Here, we found that the indium tin oxide (ITO) will deteriorate the photovoltaic performance of PSCs through positive feedback cycles. Specifically, the perovskite degradation products will cross the electron transport layer to chemically etch the electrode ITO to generate In3+, which will migrate upwards into the perovskite film. Then, the reaction that corrodes ITO consumes the decomposition products of perovskite and shifts the balance of the perovskite decomposition reaction, further promoting the degradation and thus falling into a positive feedback cycle. Moreover, the In3+ in the perovskite film was found to accumulate at the upper surface, which would lead to n&#8208;type doping of perovskite film to form the energy barrier for interface carrier extraction. Subsequently, the chelating molecule ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA&#8208;2Na) was introduced onto ITO to firmly chelate the In3+ and prevent it from migrating upward, thus breaking this internal positive feedback cycle and significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of PSCs. This work provides new perspectives for understanding the mechanism of photovoltaic performance loss and ionic transport in PSCs.

         <title>Design, Preparation, and Implementation of Axially Chiral Benzotetramisoles as Lewis Base Catalysts for Asymmetric Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of benzotetramisole Lewis base catalysts (AxBTMs) that have both central and axial chirality were developed. This unique feature of these catalysts results in a three&#8208;dimensional microenvironment with multi&#8208;layers of chirality. The performance of the developed catalysts were tested in a series of cycloaddition reactions, giving cycloaddition products with high stereoselectivities that are otherwise difficult to achieve with conventional BTM catalysts. Control experiments indicated that the axial and central chirality played a synergistic role in controlling the stereochemistry.







Abstract
Developing novel catalysts with potent activity is of great importance in organocatalysis. In this study, we designed and prepared a new class of benzotetramisole Lewis base catalysts (AxBTM) that have both central and axial chirality. This unique feature of these catalysts results in a three&#8208;dimensional microenvironment with multi&#8208;layers of chirality. The performance of the developed catalysts was tested in a series of cycloaddition reactions. These included the AxBTM&#8208;catalyzed (2+2) cycloaddition between &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl anhydride with imines or oxindoles, and the sequential gold/AxBTM&#8208;catalyzed (4+2) cycloaddition of enynamides with pentafluorophenyl esters. The interplay between axial and central chirality had a collaborative effect in regulating the stereochemistry in these cycloadditions, leading to high levels of stereoselectivity that would otherwise be challenging to achieve using conventional BTM catalysts. However, the (2+2) and (4+2) cycloadditions have different predilections for axial and central chirality combinations.

         <title>Reviving Cost&#8208;Effective Organic Cathodes in Halide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery based on a cost&#8208;effective organic cathode material phenanthrenequinone (PQ) and a halide solid electrolyte Li2ZrCl6. The PQ cathode achieved a high specific capacity of 248&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (96&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity), a high working voltage of 2.74&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li), and a good capacity retention of 95&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
The evolution of inorganic solid electrolytes has revolutionized the field of sustainable organic cathode materials, particularly by addressing the dissolution problems in traditional liquid electrolytes. However, current sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;organic batteries still face challenges such as high working temperatures, high costs, and low voltages. Here, we design an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery based on a cost&#8208;effective organic cathode material phenanthrenequinone (PQ) and a halide solid electrolyte Li2ZrCl6. Thanks to the good compatibility between PQ and Li2ZrCl6, the PQ cathode achieved a high specific capacity of 248&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (96&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity), a high average discharge voltage of 2.74&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li), and a good capacity retention of 95&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C). Furthermore, the interactions between the high&#8208;voltage carbonyl PQ cathode and both sulfide and halide solid electrolytes, as well as the redox mechanism of the PQ cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, were carefully studied by a variety of advanced characterizations. We believe such a design and the corresponding investigations into the underlying chemistry give insights for the further development of practical all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;organic batteries.

         <title>A General Strategy for Sustainable 3D Printing Based on A Multifunctional Photoinitiator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multifunctional photoinitiator that offers precise control over light&#8208;induced polymerization initiation (450&#8197;nm) and material degradation (365&#8197;nm) is developed. Upon degradation, the resulting linear polymers can be easily re&#8208;dissolved in their corresponding monomer and re&#8208;cured. Furthermore, this photoinitiator facilitates the successful 3D printing of intricate and precise structures. This represents a promising general strategy for the development of recyclable photoresins for 3D printing.







Abstract
A multifunctional photoinitiator is presented, offering precise control over light&#8208;induced polymerization initiation at 450&#8197;nm and material degradation at 365&#8197;nm. This is accomplished by covalently linking photoactive bis(acyl)phosphane oxide and photocleavable o&#8208;nitrobenzyl ether moieties onto the surface of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin. Upon degradation, the resulting linear polymers can be easily re&#8208;dissolved in their corresponding monomer and re&#8208;cured, exhibiting superior mechanical properties compared to the pristine material. Moreover, this photoinitiator enables the successful 3D printing of intricate and precise structures, representing a promising general strategy for developing recyclable photoresins for 3D printing applications.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvation Structure Enables Stable Operation of Ether&#8208;Based Electrolyte in High&#8208;Voltage Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure is realized in the co&#8208;solvent ether&#8208;based electrolyte at a medium concentration of 1.5&#8197;M. The introduction of weakly solvated DBE cosolvent greatly weakens the K+&#8208;solvent coordination, reducing the K+ desolvation energy. Furthermore, more anions occupy the inner solvation sheath, which enhances the oxidative stability and facilitates the formation of robust and stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface with inorganic&#8208;rich interphase. These assure the ultrahigh compatibility with K metal anode and excellent electrochemical performance at high voltage.







Abstract
Electrolytes with anion&#8208;dominated solvation are promising candidates to achieve dendrite&#8208;free and high&#8208;voltage potassium metal batteries. However, it's challenging to form anion&#8208;reinforced solvates at low salt concentrations. Herein, we construct an anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure at a moderate concentration of 1.5&#8197;M with weakly coordinated cosolvent ethylene glycol dibutyl ether. The unique solvation structure accelerates the desolvation of K+, strengthens the oxidative stability to 4.94&#8197;V and facilitates the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich and stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. These enable stable plating/stripping of K metal anode over 2200&#8197;h, high capacity retention of 83.0&#8201;% after 150 cycles with a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#8197;V in K0.67MnO2//K cells, and even 91.5&#8201;% after 30 cycles under 4.7&#8197;V. This work provides insight into weakly coordinated cosolvent and opens new avenues for designing ether&#8208;based high&#8208;voltage electrolytes.

         <title>Cyclic Azahelicene Dimers Showing Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Selective Fluoride Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aza[7]helicenes or closed&#8208;aza[7]helicenes with (1R)&#8208;menthyl substituents were selectively synthesized, and the diastereomeric pairs were successively separated by silica gel column chromatography. The optically pure helicenes were further transformed into the corresponding cyclic dimers which showed bright circularly polarized luminescence and selective recognition of a fluoride anion.







Abstract
Although helicenes are promising molecules, the synthetic difficulty and tediousness have often been problems, and only small amounts of optically pure helicenes have been obtained by using chiral HPLC in most cases. Herein, aza[7]helicenes or closed&#8208;aza[7]helicenes with (1R)&#8208;menthyl substituents were selectively synthesized via the intramolecular Scholl reaction, and the diastereomeric pairs were separated by silica gel column chromatography. The optically pure helicenes were further transformed into the corresponding cyclic dimers, and the chiroptical properties were investigated. The rigid &#960;&#8208;frameworks of the dimers led to the high molar extinction coefficients and fluorescence quantum yields, while the twisted helicene moieties induced clear Cotton effects and CPL in the visible region, and the high CPL brightness (BCPL) was achieved. Furthermore, the cyclic dimers were found to have the macrocyclic cavity with the two NH groups suitable for the selective binding of a fluoride anion, which induced significantly redshifted fluorescence and CPL in the red region.

         <title>Ruthenium Nanoclusters and Single Atoms on &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Achieves Low&#8208;Input/Input&#8208;Free Hydrogen Evolution via Decoupled/Coupled Hydrazine Oxidation</title>

         <dc:description>
The synergistic activation of the bifunctional reaction kinetics of cubic &#945;&#8208;MoC nanoparticles decorated&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon by the concomitant Ru nanoclusters and single atom enables the efficient coupling or decoupling of hydrazine oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction for the multifold H2 production via the zinc hydrazine battery&#8208;driven overall hydrazine splitting system.







Abstract
The hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted H2 evolution method promises low&#8208;input and input&#8208;free hydrogen production. However, developing high&#8208;performance catalysts for hydrazine oxidation (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution (HER) is challenging. Here, we introduce a bifunctional electrocatalyst &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C/RuNSA, merging ruthenium (Ru) nanoclusters (NCs) and single atoms (SA) into cubic &#945;&#8208;MoC nanoparticles&#8208;decorated N&#8208;doped carbon (&#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C) nanowires, through electrodeposition. The composite showcases exceptional activity for both HzOR and HER, requiring &#8722;80&#8197;mV and &#8722;9&#8197;mV respectively to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical and experimental insights confirm the importance of two Ru species for bifunctionality: NCs enhance the conductivity, and its coexistence with SA balances the H ad/desorption for HER and facilitates the initial dehydrogenation during the HzOR. In the overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) system, &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C/RuNSA excels as both anode and cathode materials, achieving 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at just 64&#8197;mV. The zinc hydrazine (Zn&#8722;Hz) battery assembled with &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C/RuNSA cathode and Zn foil anode can exhibit 97.3&#8201;% energy efficiency, as well as temporary separation of hydrogen gas during the discharge process. Therefore, integrating Zn&#8722;Hz with OHzS system enables self&#8208;powered H2 evolution, even in hydrazine sewage. Overall, the amalgamation of NCs with SA achieves diverse catalytic activities for yielding multifold hydrogen gas through advanced cell&#8208;integrated&#8208;electrolyzer system.

         <title>Thickness&#8208;Driven Synthesis and Applications of Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview discusses the progress in covalent organic framework nanosheets, with a focus on studies that compare the performance of covalent organic nanosheets (CONs) with covalent organic frameworks (COFs) by demonstrating the impact of thickness and lateral growth of the nanosheets. The applications of CONs in components of batteries, as well as in biomedical applications, sensing, and heterogeneous catalysis are highlighted.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are two&#8208;dimensional, crystalline porous framework materials with numerous scopes for tunability, such as porosity, functionality, stability and aspect ratio (thickness to length ratio). The manipulation of &#960;&#8208;stacking in COFs results in truly 2D materials, namely covalent organic nanosheets (CONs), adds advantages in many applications. In this Minireview, we have discussed both top&#8208;down (COFs&#8594;CONs) and bottom&#8208;up (molecules&#8594;CONs) approaches with precise information on thickness and lateral growth. We have showcased the research progress on CONs in a few selected applications, such as batteries, catalysis, sensing and biomedical applications. This Minireview specifically highlights the reports where the authors compare the performance of CONs with COFs by demonstrating the impact of the thickness and lateral growth of the nanosheets. We have also provided the possible scope of exploration of CONs research in terms of inter&#8208;dimensional conversion, such as graphene to carbon nanotube and future technologies.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NbC nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanofibers are proposed as electrocatalysts to reduce nitrate/nitrite to ammonia, which attains an outstanding ammonia yield of 30.9&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.4&#8201;%.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal carbides with metallic properties have been extensively used as electrocatalysts due to their excellent conductivity and unique electronic structures. Herein, NbC nanoparticles decorated carbon nanofibers (NbC@CNFs) are proposed as an efficient and robust catalyst for electrochemical synthesis of ammonia from nitrate/nitrite reduction, which achieves a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 94.4&#8201;% and a large ammonia yield of 30.9&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat.. In situ electrochemical tests reveal the nitrite reduction at the catalyst surface follows the *NO pathway and theoretical calculations reveal the formation of NbC@CNFs heterostructure significantly broadens density of states nearby the Fermi energy. Finite element simulations unveil that the current and electric field converge on the NbC nanoparticles along the fiber, suggesting the dispersed carbides are highly active for nitrite reduction.

Herein, NbC nanoparticles decorated carbon nanofibers (NbC@CNFs) are proposed as an efficient and robust catalyst for electrochemical synthesis of ammonia from nitrate/nitrite reduction, which achieves a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 94.4&#8201;% and a large ammonia yield of 30.9&#8197;mg&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;. In situ electrochemical tests reveal the nitrite reduction at the catalyst surface follows the *NO pathway and theoretical calculations reveal the formation of NbC@CNFs heterostructure significantly broadens density of states nearby the Fermi energy. Finite element simulations unveil that the current and electric field converge on the NbC nanoparticles along the fiber, suggesting the dispersed carbides are highly active for nitrite reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stepwise Protonation of Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhancing Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of imine&#8208;linked 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs were constructed and modified through a stepwise protonation of imine and porphyrin sites. Both benzo&#8208;selenadiazole functional groups and dual protonation increase the visible light absorption and charge separation, synergistically promoting the photocatalytic H2O2 production.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs), recognized for their tailorable structures and accessible active sites, offer a promising platform for developing advanced photocatalysts. However, the difficulty in the synthesis and functionalization of 3D COFs hinders their further development. In this study, we present a series of 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs with 8 connected porphyrin units linked by linear linkers through imine bonds as a versatile platform for photocatalyst design. The photoresponse of 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs was initially modulated by functionalizing linear linkers with benzo&#8208;thiadiazole or benzo&#8208;selenadiazole groups. Furthermore, taking advantage of the well&#8208;exposed porphyrin and imine sites in 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs, their photocatalytic activity was optimized by stepwise protonation of imine bonds and porphyrin centers. The dual protonated COF with benzo&#8208;selenadiazole groups exhibited enhanced charge separation, leading to an increased photocatalytic H2O2 production under visible light. This enhancement demonstrates the combined benefits of linker functionalization and stepwise protonation on photocatalytic efficiency.

         <title>Unveiling Dynamic Structure and Bond Evolutions in BiOIO3 Photocatalysts during CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of operando X&#8208;ray diffraction with photoelectron spectroscopy has been conducted to correlate dynamic structure and bond evolutions with CO2 reduction activity on BiOIO3 photocatalysts.







Abstract
We have established a correlation between photocatalytic activity and dynamic structure/bond evolutions of BiOIO3&#8208;based photocatalysts during CO2 reduction by combining operando X&#8208;ray diffraction with photoelectron spectroscopy. More specifically, the selective photo&#8208;deposition of PtOx species on BiOIO3 (010) facets could effectively promote the electron enrichment on Bi active sites of (100) facets for facilitating the adsorption/activation of CO2 molecules, leading to the formation of Bi sites with high oxidation state and the shrink of crystalline structures. With introducing light irradiation to drive CO2 reduction, the Bi active sites with high oxidation states transformed into normal Bi3+ state, accompanying with the expansion of crystalline structures. Owing to the dynamic structure, bond, and chemical&#8208;state evolutions, a significant improvement of photocatalytic activity for CO evolution has been achieved on PtOx&#8208;BiOIO3 (195.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1), much higher than the pristine (61.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) as well as metal&#8208;Pt decorated BiOIO3 (70.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) samples. This work provides new insights to correlate the intrinsically dynamic structure/bond evolutions with CO2 reduction activity, which may help to guide future photocatalyst design.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Effect&#8208;Enabled Photocatalytic 4&#8208;Exo&#8208;Trig Cyclization Cascade to Access Fluoroalkylated Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing fluoroalkylcyclobutanes is realized by photocatalytic 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization cascade of thioalkynes or trifluoromethylalkenes. DFT calculations suggest that a fluorine effect, resulting from hyperconjugative &#960;&#8594;&#963;*C&#8208;F interactions, accounts for the &#945;&#8208;selective radical addition at the sterically hindered alkene carbon, which facilitates the uncommon 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig ring closure.







Abstract
Cyclobutanes are popular structural units in bioactive compounds and versatile intermediates in synthetic chemistry, but their synthesis is challenging owing to high ring strain. In this study, a novel method for highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of fluoroalkylcyclobutanes bearing vicinal quaternary and tertiary stereocenters is realized by a photocatalytic 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization cascade of thioalkynes or trifluoromethylalkenes. Density functional theory calculations reveal that a unique fluorine effect, arising from hyperconjugative &#960;&#8594;&#963;*C&#8208;F interactions, accounts for the regio&#8208;reversed radical addition at the sterically hindered alkene carbon, which facilitates an unprecedented 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig ring closure. This chemistry enables the direct and controllable construction of medicinally valuable quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing cyclobutanes from readily available raw materials, nicely complementing the existing methods.

         <title>Strong and Tough MXene Bridging&#8208;induced Conductive Nacre</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the need to reduce global carbon emissions, it remains a great challenge to prepare nacre&#8208;inspired composites using more economical and environmentally friendly building blocks. We fabricated tough and conductive nacre composites through reassembling aragonite platelets with bridging by MXene nanosheets and hydrogen bonding, not only providing high mechanical properties but also excellent electrical conductivity. The resultant conductive nacre also provides a self&#8208;monitoring function for structural damage and offers exceptional electromagnetic interference shielding performance.







Abstract
Nacre is a classic model, providing an inspiration for fabricating high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites with the two&#8208;dimensional platelets. However, the &#8220;brick&#8221; of nacre, aragonite platelet, is an ideal building block for making high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites. Herein, we demonstrated a strong and tough conductive nacre through reassembling aragonite platelets with bridged by MXene nanosheets and hydrogen bonding, not only providing high mechanical properties but also excellent electrical conductivity. The flexural strength and fracture toughness of the obtained conductive nacre reach ~282&#8197;MPa and ~6.3&#8197;MPa&#8201;m1/2, which is 1.6 and 1.6&#8197;times higher than that of natural nacre, respectively. These properties are attributed to densification and high orientation degree of the conductive nacre, which is effectively induced by the combined interactions of hydrogen bonding and MXene nanosheets bridging. The crack propagations in conductive nacre are effectively inhibited through crack deflection with hydrogen bonding, and MXene nanosheets bridging between aragonite platelets. In addition, our conductive nacre also provides a self&#8208;monitoring function for structural damage and offers exceptional electromagnetic interference shielding performance. Our strategy of reassembling the aragonite platelets exfoliated from waste nacre into high&#8208;performance artificial nacre, provides an avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites through the sustainable reutilization of shell resources.

The electrophilicity of the imine and steric effects promoted a face&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;allyl migration in the presence of Lewis acidic boronic acids, yielding chiral &#945;&#8208;amino ketones with excellent diastereoselectivity. This method was applied to the total synthesis of hapalindole alkaloids.







Abstract
A carbonyl&#8208;assisted asymmetric 1,2&#8208;migratory allylation through in situ generation of vicinal tetrasubstituted stereocenters is reported to access enantiopure &#945;&#8208;amino ketones and amino alcohols with excellent yields and diastereoselectivities. In a remarkable divergence, despite higher steric hindrance, the allylation exclusively occurs on ketones over imines in the first step, followed by a face&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;allyl transfer, thus highlighting an exciting interplay between two distinct electrophiles. The methodology distinguishes itself through its adaptability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, showcasing broad functional&#8208;group tolerance and stereodivergence. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis led to a deeper understanding of its selectivity and mechanistic framework. Highlighting its transformative potential, the method was applied to the total synthesis of hapalindole alkaloids.

         <title>Acyl Phosphates as Chemically Fueled Building Blocks for Self&#8208;Sustaining Protocells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium compartments regulated by an acyl phosphate chemical reaction network via chemical activation of carboxylic acids and alkyl phosphates. The compartments exist in the presence of chemical energy and decay without it. The chemical reaction network produces compartments even with prebiotically relevant activating agents, thus making it an attractive tool for studying Darwinian evolution in prebiotically plausible chemical systems incorporated with genotype&#8208;possessing structures.







Abstract
Lipids spontaneously assemble into vesicle&#8208;forming membranes. Such vesicles serve as compartments for even the simplest living systems. Vesicles have been extensively studied for constructing synthetic cells or as models for protocells&#8212;the cells hypothesized to have existed before life. These compartments exist almost always close to equilibrium. Life, however, exists out of equilibrium. In this work, we studied vesicle&#8208;based compartments regulated by a non&#8208;equilibrium chemical reaction network that converts activating agents. In this way, the compartments require a constant or periodic supply of activating agents to sustain themselves. Specifically, we use activating agents to condense carboxylates and phosphate esters into acyl phosphate&#8208;based lipids that form vesicles. These vesicles can only be sustained when condensing agents are present; without them, they decay. We demonstrate that the chemical reaction network can operate on prebiotic activating agents, opening the door to prebiotically plausible, self&#8208;sustainable protocells that compete for resources. In future work, such protocells should be endowed with a genotype, e.g., self&#8208;replicating RNA structures, to alter the protocell's behavior. Such protocells could enable Darwinian evolution in a prebiotically plausible chemical system.

         <title>Designed Additive to Regulated Crystallization for High Performance Perovskite Solar Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing DFA additive into perovskite solution and interacting with DMSO, DTE and DA products were obtained. The strong bonding DTE&#8901;PbI2 and DA&#8901;PbI2 retard perovskite crystallization process for high&#8208;quality and low defects perovskite film. Finally, a champion PCE of 25.28&#8201;% was achieved with excellent environmental stability, which retained 95.75&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 1152&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C under 25&#8201;% RH.







Abstract
It is a crucial role for enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to prepare high&#8208;quality perovskite films, which can be achieved by delaying the crystallization of perovskite film. Hence, we designed difluoroacetic anhydride (DFA) as an additive to regulating crystallization process thus reducing defect formation during perovskite film formation. It was found DFA reacts with DMSO by forming two molecules, difluoroacetate thioether ester (DTE) and difluoroacetic acid (DA). The strong bonding DTE&#8901;PbI2 and DA&#8901;PbI2 retard perovskite crystallization process for high&#8208;quality film formation, which was monitored through in situ UV/Vis and PL tests. By using DFA additives, we prepared perovskite films with high&#8208;quality and low defects. Finally, a champion PCE of 25.28&#8201;% was achieved with excellent environmental stability, which retained 95.75&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 1152&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C under 25&#8201;% RH.

         <title>Designing Dual&#8208;Site Catalysts for Selectively Converting CO2 into Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following the theoretical predictions, a high&#8208;performance catalyst with oxophilic Mo single atoms and Pt nanoparticles was successfully synthesized. When applied in CO2 hydrogenation, the obtained dual&#8208;site catalyst induces selectively the generation of methanol in high rate (0.27&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). The synergistic effect of Pt nanoparticles and Mo single atoms efficiently change the adsorption configuration and conversion pathway of the key intermediate *OCH2.







Abstract
The variability of CO2 hydrogenation reaction demands new potential strategies to regulate the fine structure of the catalysts for optimizing the reaction pathways. Herein, we report a dual&#8208;site strategy to boost the catalytic efficiency of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion. A new descriptor, &#964;, was initially established for screening the promising candidates with low&#8208;temperature activation capability of CO2, and sequentially a high&#8208;performance catalyst was fabricated centred with oxophilic Mo single atoms, who was further decorated with Pt nanoparticles. In CO2 hydrogenation, the obtained dual&#8208;site catalysts possess a remarkably&#8208;improved methanol generation rate (0.27&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). For comparison, the singe&#8208;site Mo and Pt&#8208;based catalysts can only produce ethanol and formate acid at a relatively low reaction rate (0.11&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for ethanol and 0.034&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for formate acid), respectively. Mechanism studies indicate that the introduction of Pt species could create an active hydrogen&#8208;rich environment, leading to the alterations of the adsorption configuration and conversion pathways of the *OCH2 intermediates on Mo sites. As a result, the catalytic selectivity was successfully switched.

         <title>Eosinophil&#8208;Activating Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles for Cancer Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eosinophil&#8208;activating semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNe) synergized with immune checkpoint inhibitors are developed to reinvigorate eosinophil&#8208; and T&#8197;cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, providing a new avenue for cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy.







Abstract
Eosinophils are important immune effector cells that affect T&#8197;cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity. However, the low frequency and restrained activity of eosinophils restricted the outcome of cancer immunotherapies. We herein report an eosinophil&#8208;activating semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPNe) to improve photodynamic tumor immunogenicity, modulate eosinophil chemotaxis, and reinvigorate T&#8208;cell immunity for activated cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy. SPNe comprises an amphiphilic semiconducting polymer and a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor sitagliptin via a 1O2&#8208;cleavable thioketal linker. Upon localized NIR photoirradiation, SPNe generates 1O2 to elicit immunogenic cell death of tumors and induce specific activation of sitagliptin. The subsequent inhibition of DPP4 increases intratumoral CCL11 levels to promote eosinophil chemotaxis and activation. SPNe&#8208;mediated photo&#8208;immunotherapy synergized with immune checkpoint blockade greatly promotes tumor infiltration and activation of both eosinophils and T&#8197;cells, effectively inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, this study presents a generic polymeric nanoplatform to modulate specific immune cells for precision cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Unraveling Stoichiometry Effect in Nickel&#8208;Tungsten Alloys for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Catalysis in Alkaline Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alloying nickel with tungsten can tailor the catalytic surface to favor hydroxyl adsorption, tuning the connectivity of hydrogen&#8208;bond networks. Accordingly, the optimal Ni17W3 alloy exhibits hydrogen oxidation catalytic activity superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art platinum catalyst in alkali and operates steadily with negligible decay after 10,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells provide the possibility to use platinum group metal&#8208;free catalysts, but the anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) suffers from sluggish kinetics and its source is still debated. Here, over nickel&#8208;tungsten (Ni&#8722;W) alloy catalysts, we show that the Ni&#8201;:&#8201;W ratio greatly governs the HOR performance in alkaline electrolyte. Experimental and theoretical studies unravel that alloying with W can tune the unpaired electrons in Ni, tailoring the potential of zero charge and the catalytic surface to favor hydroxyl adsorption (OHad). The OHad species coordinately interact with potassium (K+) ions, which break the K+ solvation sheath to leave free water molecules, yielding an improved connectivity of hydrogen&#8208;bond networks. Consequently, the optimal Ni17W3 alloy exhibits alkaline HOR activity superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art platinum on carbon (Pt/C) catalyst and operates steadily with negligible decay after 10,000&#8197;cycles. Our findings offer new understandings of alloyed HOR catalysts and will guide rational design of next&#8208;generation catalysts for fuel cells.

         <title>Ligand Isomerization Driven Electrocatalytic Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand geometry can direct the reactivity and selectivity of dioxygen cleavage in molecular electrocatalysis. It is shown that even on exclusively peroxide&#8208;producing catalytic sites, the dioxygen binding modes can be precisely controlled via a seemingly minor change in ligand isomerization, with their activity almost equaling that of Pt in an actual H2&#8722;O2 fuel cell.







Abstract
The prevailing view about molecular catalysts is that the central metal ion is responsible for the reaction mechanism and selectivity, whereas the ligands mainly affect the reaction kinetics. Here, we question this paradigm and show that ligands have a dramatic influence on the selectivity of the product. We show how even a seemingly small change in ligand isomerization sharply alters the selectivity of the well&#8208;researched oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) Co phthalocyanine catalyst from an indirect 2e&#8722; to a direct 4e&#8722; pathway. Detailed analysis reveals that intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions in the ligand activate the catalytic Co, directing the oxygen binding and thus deciding the final product. The resulting catalyst is the first example of a Co&#8208;based molecular catalyst catalyzing a direct 4e&#8722; ORR via ligand isomerization, for which it shows an activity close to the benchmark Pt in an actual H2&#8722;O2 fuel cell. The effect of the ligand isomerism is demonstrated with different central metal ions, thus highlighting the generalizability of the findings and their potential to open new possibilities in the design of molecular catalysts.

         <title>Bridging Nickel&#8208;MOF and Copper Single Atoms/Clusters with H&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne for the Tandem Catalysis of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Few&#8208;layered H&#8208;substituted graphdiyne bridges ultrathin Ni&#8208;MOF nanosheets and Cu single atoms/clusters to construct a tandem electrocatalyst for enhanced nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia transformation. The synergistic effect between Ni2+ and Cu is revealed to optimize the reaction path, resulting in a high efficiency over a wide potential window.







Abstract
Interfacial engineering of synergistic catalysts is one of the keys to achieving multiple proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes in nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. Herein, by joining ultrathin nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (denoted Ni&#8208;MOF) nanosheets with few&#8208;layered hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne&#8208;supported copper single atoms and clusters (denoted HsGDY@Cu), a tandem catalyst of Ni&#8208;MOFs@HsGDY@Cu with dual&#8208;active interfaces was developed for the concerted catalysis of nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia. In such a system, the sandwiched HsGDY layer could serve as a bridge to connect the coordinated unsaturated Ni2+ sites with Cu single atoms/clusters in a limited range of 0 to 3.6&#8197;nm. From Ni2+ to Cu, via the hydrogen spillover process, the hydrogen radicals (H&#8901;) generated at the unsaturated Ni2+ sites could migrate across HsGDY to the Cu sites to participate in the transformation of *HNO3 to NH3. From Cu to Ni2+, bypassing the higher reaction energy for *HNO3 formation on the Ni2+ sites, the NO2&#8722; detached from the Cu sites could diffuse onto the unsaturated Ni2+ sites to form NH3 as well. The combined results make this hybrid a tandem catalyst with dual active sites for the catalysis of nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion with improved Faradaic efficiency at lower overpotentials.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembled Active and Stable Ir@MnOx/La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.9Ir0.1O3&#8722;&#948; Interfaces for CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The internal B&#8208;site supplement of Mn ions via topotactic exchange and external protective barrier of MnOx shell via redispersion in reduction atmosphere facilitate the formation of Ir@MnOx/La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.9Ir0.1O3&#8722;&#948; interfaces and enhance their structural stability, achieving improved activity and durability for CO2 electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cells.







Abstract
Solid oxide electrolysis cells are prospective approaches for CO2 utilization but face significant challenges due to the sluggish reaction kinetics and poor stability of the fuel electrodes. Herein, we strategically addressed the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off phenomenon between enhanced exsolution and improved structural stability via topotactic ion exchange. The surface dynamic reconstruction of the MnOx/La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.9Ir0.1O3&#8722;&#948; (LSCIr) catalyst was visualized at the atomic scale. Compared with the Ir@LSCIr interface, the in situ self&#8208;assembled Ir@MnOx/LSCIr interface exhibited greater CO2 activation and easily removable carbonate intermediates, thus reached a 42&#8201;% improvement in CO2 electrolysis performance at 1.6&#8197;V. Furthermore, an improved CO2 electrolysis stability was achieved due to the uniformly wrapped MnOx shell of the Ir@MnOx/LSCIr cathode. Our approach enables a detailed understanding of the dynamic microstructure evolution at active interfaces and provides a roadmap for the rational design and evaluation of efficient metal/oxide catalysts for CO2 electrolysis.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dumbbell&#8208;shaped hydrocarbon block&#8208;graft copolymer was synthesized for use as a polymer electrolyte membrane. The introduction of comb&#8208;type side chains resulted in a highly aligned morphology with enhanced microphase separation. The poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butylene&#8208;b&#8208;styrene)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(styrene sulfonic acid) membrane achieved outstanding ion conductivity and maintained stable fuel cell performance for 150&#8197;h.

Given the environmental concerns surrounding fluoromaterials, the use of high&#8208;cost perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) in fuel cells and water electrolysis contradicts the pursuit of clean energy systems. Herein, we present a fluorine&#8208;free dumbbell&#8208;shaped block&#8208;graft copolymer, derived from the cost&#8208;effective triblock copolymer, poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butylene&#8208;b&#8208;styrene) (SEBS), for polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs). This unique polymer shape led to the alignment of the hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic domains along a preferred orientation, resulting in the construction of interconnected proton channels across the membrane. A bicontinuous network allowed efficient proton transport with reduced tortuosity, leading to an exceptional ionic conductivity (249&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8201;% relative humidity (RH)), despite a low ion exchange capacity (IEC; 1.41). Furthermore, membrane electrode assembly (MEA) prepared with our membrane exhibited stable performance over a period of 150&#8197;h at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 30&#8201;% RH. This study demonstrates a novel polymer structure design and highlights a promising outlook for hydrocarbon PEMs as alternatives to PFSAs.

&lt;p&gt;A dumbbell-shaped hydrocarbon block-graft copolymer was synthesized for use as a polymer electrolyte membrane. The introduction of comb-type side chains resulted in a highly aligned morphology with enhanced microphase separation.

         <title>Highly Efficient Acidic Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide at Industrial&#8208;Level Current Densities Promoted by Alkali Metal Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali metal cations, acting as competing ions with H+, promote selective electrocatalytic reduction of O2 to H2O2 instead of H2O in a highly concentrated acidic electrolyte at high currents. The electrocatalytic environments involving water and alkali metal cations are pivotal in boosting H2O2 generation by stabilizing the crucial *OOH intermediate.







Abstract
Acidic H2O2 synthesis through electrocatalytic 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction presents a sustainable alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone oxidation technology. Nevertheless, acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis suffers from low H2O2 Faradaic efficiencies primarily due to the competing reactions of 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction to H2O and hydrogen evolution in environments with high H+ concentrations. Here, we demonstrate the significant effect of alkali metal cations, acting as competing ions with H+, in promoting acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis at industrial&#8208;level currents, resulting in an effective current densities of 50&#8211;421&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 84&#8211;100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and a production rate of 856&#8211;7842&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 that far exceeds the performance observed in pure acidic electrolytes or low&#8208;current electrolysis. Finite&#8208;element simulations indicate that high interfacial pH near the electrode surface formed at high currents is crucial for activating the promotional effect of K+. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the central role of alkali metal cations in stabilizing the key *OOH intermediate to suppress 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction through interacting with coordinated H2O.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Hemicyanines as Modular Scaffolds for in vivo Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a modular chemical platform for the synthesis of targeted near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers including enzymatic cages and biocompatible units. We demonstrated its utility with the design of a cathepsin B&#8208;activatable agent for safe ablation of microtumors in vivo in a zebrafish preclinical model.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy is an anti&#8208;cancer treatment that requires illumination of photosensitizers to induce local cell death. Current near&#8208;infrared organic photosensitizers are built from large and non&#8208;modular structures that cannot be tuned to improve safety and minimize off&#8208;target toxicity. This work describes a novel chemical platform to generate enzyme&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers. We optimized the Se&#8208;bridged hemicyanine scaffold to include caging groups and biocompatible moieties, and generated cathepsin&#8208;triggered photosensitizers for effective ablation of human glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that enzyme&#8208;activatable Se&#8208;bridged hemicyanines are effective photosensitizers for the safe ablation of microtumors in vivo, creating new avenues in the chemical design of targeted anti&#8208;cancer photodynamic therapy agents.

         <title>Supramolecular Modifying Nafion with Fluoroalkyl&#8208;Functionalized Polyoxometalate Nanoclusters for High&#8208;Selective Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton exchange membranes with high selectivity are urgently required in energy and electronic technologies. Nafion, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial proton exchange membrane material, faces significant challenges. It suffers from the permeation of undesirable substances, like hydrogen in fuel cells and vanadium ions in redox flow batteries, due to the unmatched sizes between its ionic domains (3~5 nm) and these substances. In this work, we present a supramolecular modification strategy that simultaneously enhances the proton conductivity and selectivity of Nafion. We employ fluoroalkyl&#8208;grafted polyoxometalate (POMs) nanoclusters as supramolecular additives to modify Nafion via co&#8208;assembly. These POMs can precisely and robustly decorate at Nafion ionic domains, with their fluoroalkyl chains anchoring into the perfluorinated matrix while their inorganic clusters stay in the ionic regions. The hybrid membranes, with continuous proton hopping sites and nanoscale steric hindrance offered by POMs, exhibit a 56% increase in proton conductivity and a 100% improvement in proton/vanadium selectivity. This leads to significantly enhanced power density and energy efficiency in fuel cells and vanadium flow batteries, respectively. These results underscore the intriguing potential of molecular cluster additives in improving the functions of ion&#8208;conducting membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual Cobalt&#8208;Photoredox Catalytic Approach for Asymmetric Dearomatization of Indoles with Aryl Amides via C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we unveil a novel method for the asymmetric dearomatization of indoles under cobalt/photoredox catalysis. By strategically activating C&#8208;H bonds of amides and subsequent migratory insertion of &#160;p&#8208;bonds present in indole as reactive partner, we achieve syn&#8208;selective tetrahydro&#8208;5H&#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;c]isoquinolin&#8208;5&#8208;one derivatives with excellent yields and enantiomeric excesses of up to &gt;99%. The developed method operates without a metal oxidant, relying solely on oxygen as the oxidant and employing an organic dye as a photocatalyst under irradiation. Control experiments and stoichiometric studies elucidate the reversible nature of the enantiodetermining C&#8208;H activation step, albeit not being rate&#8208;determining. This study not only expands the horizon of cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8208;H bond functionalization, but also showcases the potential synergy between cobalt and photoredox catalysis in enabling asymmetric synthesis of complex molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Enantioenriched Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Benzyl&#8722;, Vinyl&#8722; and Borylsilanes via Asymmetric Aryl to Alkyl 1,5&#8208;Palladium Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of Si&#8208;bound methyl group provides an efficient access to diverse organosilanes. However, the asymmetric construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic architectures by functionalization of Si&#8208;bound methyl group has not yet been described despite recent significant progress in producing chiral silicon. Herein, we disclosed the enantioselective silylmethyl functionalization involving the aryl to alkyl 1,5&#8208;palladium migration to access diverse naphthalenes possessing an enantioenriched stereogenic silicon center, which are inaccessible before. It is worthy to note that the realization of asymmetric induction at the step of metal migration itself remains challenging. Our study constitutes the first enantioselective aryl to alkyl 1,5&#8208;palladium migration reaction.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functionalization of Si-bound methyl group provides an efficient access to diverse organosilanes. However, the asymmetric construction of silicon-stereogenic architectures by functionalization of Si-bound methyl group has not yet been described despite recent significant progress in producing chiral silicon. Herein, we disclosed the enantioselective silylmethyl functionalization involving the aryl to alkyl 1,5-palladium migration to access diverse naphthalenes possessing an enantioenriched stereogenic silicon center, which are inaccessible before. It is worthy to note that the realization of asymmetric induction at the step of metal migration itself remains challenging. Our study constitutes the first enantioselective aryl to alkyl 1,5-palladium migration reaction. The key to the success is the discovery and fine-tuning of the different substituents of &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;-tetraaryl-1,3-dioxolane-4,5-dimethanol (TADDOL)-based phosphoramidites, which ensure the enantioselectivity and desired reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Diamond: A Diamondoid Superstructure Driven by &#960;&#8208;Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the arrangement of superstructures through noncovalent interactions has a significant impact on macroscopic shape and the expression of unique properties. Constructing &#960;&#8208;interaction&#8208;driven hierarchical three&#8208;dimensional (3D) superstructures poses challenges on account of limited directional control and weak intermolecular interactions. Here we report the construction of a 3D diamondoid superstructure, named &#960;&#8208;Diamond, employing a ditopic strained Z&#8208;shaped building block comprising a porphyrin unit as bow&#8208;limb double&#8208;strapped with two m&#8208;xylylene units as bowstring. This superstructure, reminiscent of diamond's tetrahedral carbon composition, is composed of double&#8208;walled tetrahedron (DWT) driven solely by &#960;&#8208;interactions. Hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking between porphyrin and m&#8208;xylylene panels drive the assembly of four building blocks predominantly into a DWT, which undergoes extension to create an adamantane unit and eventually a diamondoid superstructure wherein each porphyrin panel is shared by two neighboring tetrahedra through hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking. &#960;&#8208;Diamond exhibits a solid&#8208;state fluorescent quantum yield 44 times higher than that of tetraphenylporphyrin along with excellent photocatalytic performance. The precise 3D directionality of &#960;&#8208;interactions, achieved through strained multipanel building blocks, revolutionizes the assembly of hierarchical 3D superstructures driven by &#960;&#8208;interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A fragment based competitive 19F LB&#8208;NMR platform for hotspot directed ligand profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligand binding hotspots are regions of protein surfaces that form particularly favourable interactions with small molecule pharmacophores. Targeting interactions with these hotspots maximises the efficiency of ligand binding. Existing methods are capable of identifying hotspots but often lack assays to quantify ligand binding and direct elaboration at these sites. Herein, we describe a fragment&#8208;based competitive&#160;19F Ligand Based&#8208;NMR (LB&#8208;NMR) screening platform that enables routine, quantitative ligand profiling focused at ligand&#8208;binding hotspots. As a proof of concept, the method was applied to 4&#8217;&#8208;phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) from&#160;Mycobacterium abscessus&#160;(Mabs). X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterisation of the hits from a 960&#8208;member fragment screen identified three ligand&#8208;binding hotspots across the PPAT active site. From the fragment hits a collection of&#160;19F reporter candidates were designed and synthesised. By rigorous prioritisation and use of optimisation workflows, a single&#160;19F reporter molecule was generated for each hotspot. Profiling the binding of a set of structurally characterised ligands by competitive&#160;19F LB&#8208;NMR with this suite of&#160;19F reporters recapitulated the binding affinity and site ID assignments made by ITC and X&#8208;ray crystallography. This&#160;quantitative mapping of ligand binding events at&#160;hotspot level resolution establishes the utility of the fragment&#8208;based competitive&#160;19F LB&#8208;NMR screening platform for hotspot&#8208;directed ligand profiling</dc:description>

         <title>Trace Fluorinated Carbon dots driven Li&#8208;Garnet Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Garnet solid&#8208;state electrolyte Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) holds significant promise. However, the practical utilization has been seriously impeded by the poor contact of Li|garnet and electron leakage. Herein, one new type garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries is prososed with high&#8208;performance&#160; through the disparity in interfacial energy, induced by the reaction between trace fluorinated carbon dots (FCDs) and Li. The work of adhesion of Li|garnet is increased by the acquired Li&#8208;FCD composite, which facilitates an intimate Li|garnet interface with the promoted uniform Li+ deposition, revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is futher validated that a concentrated C&#8208;Li2O&#8208;LiF component at the Li|garnet interface is spontaneously constructed, due to the the significant disparity in interfacial energy between C&#8208;Li2O&#8208;LiF|LLZTO and C&#8208;Li2O&#8208;LiF|Li. Furthermore, The electron transport and Li dendrites penetration are effectively hindered by the formed Li2O and LiF. The Li&#8208;FCD|LLZTO|Li&#8208;FCD symmetrical cells demonstrate stable cycling performance for over 3000 hours at 0.3 mA cm&#8722;2 and 800 hours at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the LFP|garnet|Li&#8208;FCD full cell exhibit remarkable cycling performance (91.6% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1 C). Our research has revealed a novel approach to establish a dendrite&#8208;free Li|garnet interface, laying the groundwork for future advancements in garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Depolymerization of Native Lignin over Thiol Capped Ultrathin ZnIn2S4 Microbelts Mediated by Photogenerated Thiyl Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The valorization of native lignin to functionalized aromatic compounds under visible light is appealing yet challenging. In this communication, colloidal mercaptoalkanoic acid capped ultrathin ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) microbelts was successfully fabricated, which was used as a superior catalyst for depolymerization of native lignin in birch woodmeal under visible light, with an optimum yield of 28.8 wt% to functionalized aromatic monomers achieved in 8 h. The capped mercaptoalkanoic acid not only enables a solvent modulated reversible interchange of ZIS between the colloidal state for efficient reaction and the aggregated state for facile separation, but also serves as a precursor for light initiated generation of reactive thiyl radical for highly selective cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bond in native lignin. This work provides a green and efficient strategy for the depolymerization of native lignin to functionalized aromatic monomers under mild conditions, which involves a new mechanism for the cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin. The capability of cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin by photogenerated thiyl radicals also demonstrates the great potential of using photogenerated thiyl radicals in organics transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Perovskite Oxides for Electrocatalytic Acidic NOx&#8722; Reduction Streamlining Ammonia Synthesis from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrogen oxide ions reduction reaction (NOx&#8722;RR) shows great opportunity for ammonia production under ambient conditions. Yet, performing NOx&#8722;RR in strong acidic conditions remains challenging due to the corrosion effect on the catalyst and competing hydrogen evolution reactions. Here, we demonstrate a stable La1.5Sr0.5Ni0.5Fe0.5O4 perovskite oxide for the NOx&#8722;RR at pH 0, achieving a Faradaic efficiency for ammonia of approaching 100% at a current density of 2 A cm&#8722;2 in a H&#8208;type cell. At industrially relevant current density, the NOx&#8722;RR system shows stable cell voltage and Faradaic efficiency for &gt;350 h in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) at pH 0. By integrating the catalyst in a stacked MEA with a series connection, we have successfully obtained a record&#8208;breaking 2.578 g h&#8722;1 NH3 production rate at 20 A. This catalyst's unique acid&#8208;operability streamlines downstream ammonia utilization for direct ammonium salt production and upstream integration with NOx sources. Techno&#8208;economic and lifecycle assessments reveal substantial economic advantages for this ammonia production strategy, even when coupled with a plasma&#8208;based NOx production system, presenting a sustainable complement to the conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch process.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Reactive Oxygen Intermediates of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C SAzyme via Second&#8208;Shell Coordination for Selective Aerobic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation for single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes), e.g., Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C, is a key scientific issue that determines the activity, selectivity, and stability of aerobic reaction. However, the poor understanding of ROS formation mechanism on SAzymes greatly hampers their wider deployment. Herein, inspired by cytochromes P450 affording bound ROS intermediates in O2 activation, we report Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C containing the same FeN4 but with tunable second&#8208;shell coordination can effectively regulate ROS production pathways. Remarkably, compared to the control Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sample, the second&#8208;shell sulfur functionalized Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C delivered a&#183;2.4&#8208;fold increase of oxidase&#8208;like activity via the bound Fe=O intermediate. Conversely, free ROS (&#8226;O2&#8208;) release was significantly reduced after functionalization, down to only 17% of that observed for Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C. The detailed characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the second&#8208;shell sulfur functionalization significantly altered the electronic structure of FeN4 sites, leading to an increase of electron density at Fermi level. It enhanced the electron transfer from active sites to the key intermediate *OOH, thereby ultimately determining the type of ROS in aerobic oxidation process. The proposed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;Cs with different second&#8208;shell anion were further applied to three aerobic oxidation reactions with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide production from water and oxygen is particularly interesting, yet remains a challenge. Herein, we have prepared four cyclic trinuclear units (CTUs) based MOFs, exhibiting good light absorption ability and suitable bandgaps for photosynthesis of H2O2. However, Cu&#8208;CTU&#8208;based MOFs are not able to photocatalyzed the formation of H2O2, while the alteration of metal nodes from Cu&#8208;CTU to Ag&#8208;CTU dramatically enhances the photocatalytic performance for H2O2production and the production rates can reach as high as 17476 &#956;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;with an apparent quantum yield of 9.51%, at 420 nm, which is much higher than most reported MOFs.&#160;The photocatalytic mechanism is comprehensively studied by combining the isotope labeling experiments and DFT calculation. This study provides new insights into the preparation of MOF photocatalysts with high activity for H2O2&#160;production through molecular engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Microporous Ion Exchange Membranes via Simple Hypercrosslinking for pH&#8208;Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion exchange membranes (IEMs) play a critical role in aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). Traditional IEMs that feature microphase&#8208;separated microstructures are well developed and easily available but suffer from the conductivity/selectivity tradeoff. The emerging charged microporous polymer membranes show the potential to overcome this tradeoff, yet their commercialization is still hindered by tedious syntheses and demanding conditions. We herein combine the advantages of these two types of membrane materials via simple in&#8208;situ hypercrosslinking of conventional IEMs into microporous ones. Such a concept is exemplified by the very cheap commercial quaternized polyphenylene oxide membrane. The hypercrosslinking treatment turns poor&#8208;performance membranes into high&#8208;performance ones, as demonstrated by the above 10&#8208;fold selectivity enhancement and much&#8208;improved conductivities that more than doubled. This turn is also confirmed by the effective and stable pH&#8208;neutral AORFB with decreased membrane resistance and at least an order of magnitude lower capacity loss rate. This battery shows advantages over other reported AORFBs in terms of a low capacity loss rate (0.0017% per cycle) at high current density. This work provides an economically feasible method for designing AORFB&#8208;oriented membranes with microporosity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hexaarylbiimidazole&#8208;Terarylene Hybrid: Visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR&#8208;II Absorption via Sequential Photochromic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synergetic interaction between two or more photochromic chromophores has a potential to achieve advanced photochemical properties beyond conventional photochromic molecules and to realize photochemical control of complex systems using only a single molecule. Herein, we report a hybrid photochromic molecule consisting of hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) and terarylene that exhibits multi&#8208;state photochromism. The biphotochrome hybrid shows four&#8208;state photochromic reaction involving sequentially proceeding photoreactions. The UV or visible light irradiation to the biphotochrome leads to the C&#8211;N bond breaking reaction of the HABI in preference to the ring&#8208;closing reaction of the 6&#960;&#8208;electron system in the terarylene unit, leading two terarylene radical molecules. The photogenerated terarylene radical further exhibits the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization reaction by UV irradiation. The delocalized &#960;&#8208;radical on the closed&#8208;ring form of the terarylene is efficient to enhance the photosensitivity to the NIR&#8208;I and &#8208;II region. Furthermore, a recombination reaction of radicals between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers of terarylene affords an unprecedented photochromic dimer as a structural isomer of the initial molecule. This is a consequence of the sequential hybrid photochromic system involving the HABI and terarylene units.</dc:description>

         <title>Inverse Vulcanization of Activated Norbornenyl Esters &#8211; A Versatile Platform for Functional Sulfur Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elemental sulfur has shown to be a promising alternative feedstock for development of novel polymeric materials with high sulfur content. However, the utilization of inverse vulcanized polymers is restricted by the limitation of functional comonomers suitable for an inverse vulcanization. Control over properties and structure of inverse vulcanized polymers still poses a challenge to current research due to the dynamic nature of sulfur&#8208;sulfur bonds and high temperature of inverse vulcanization reactions. In here, we report for the first time the inverse vulcanization of norbornenyl pentafluorophenyl ester (NB&#8208;PFPE), allowing for post&#8208;modification of inverse vulcanized polymers via amidation of reactive PFP esters to yield high sulfur content polymers under mild conditions. Amidation of the precursor material with three functional primary amines (&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#969;&#8208;methoxy polyethylene glycol, aminopropyl trimethoxy silane, allylamine) was investigated. The resulting materials were applicable as sulfur containing poly(ethylene glycol) nanoparticles in aqueous environment. Cross&#8208;linked mercury adsorbents, sulfur surface coatings, and high&#8208;sulfur content networks with predictable thermal properties were achievable using aminopropyl trimethoxy silane and allylamine for post&#8208;polymerization modification, respectively. With the broad range of different amines available and applicable for post&#8208;polymerization modification, the versatility of poly(sulfur&#8208;random&#8208;NB&#8208;PFPE) as a platform precursor polymer for novel specialized sulfur containing materials was showcased.</dc:description>

         <title>Digital Light Processing to Afford High Resolution and Degradable CO2&#8208;Derived Copolymer Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vat photopolymerization 3D printing has proven very successful for the rapid additive manufacturing (AM) of polymeric parts at high resolution. However, the range of materials that can be printed and their resulting properties remains narrow. Herein, we report the successful AM of a series of poly(carbonate&#8208;b&#8208;ester&#8208;b&#8208;carbonate) elastomers, derived from carbon dioxide and bio&#8208;derived &#949;&#8208;decalactone. Using a Co(II)Mg(II) polymerization catalyst, an ABA triblock copolymer (Mn = 6.3 kg mol&#8208;1, &#208;M = 1.26) was synthesized and 3D printed using digital light processing (DLP) with a thiol&#8208;ene. A series of elastomeric and degradable thermosets were produced, with varying cross&#8208;linker length and poly(ethylene glycol) content, to produce complex triply periodic geometries at high resolution. Thermomechanical characterization reveals printing&#8208;induced microphase separation and tunable hydrophilicity. These findings highlight how utilizing DLP can produce sustainable materials from low molar mass polyols quickly and at high resolution. The 3D printing of these functional materials will expedite the production of sustainable plastics and elastomers which have the potential to replace conventional petrochemical&#8208;based options.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiphoton&#8208;driven Photocatalytic Defluorination of Persistent Perfluoroalkyl Substances and Polymers by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and fluorinated polymers (FPs) have been extensively utilized in various industries, whereas their extremely high stability poses environmental persistence and waste treatment. Current decomposition approaches of PFASs and FPs typically require harsh conditions such as heating over 400&#176;C. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop a new technique capable of decomposing them under mild conditions. Here, we demonstrated that perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), known as a "persistent chemical," and Nafion, a widely utilized sulfonated FP for ion&#8208;exchange membranes, can be efficiently decomposed into fluorine ions under ambient conditions via the irradiation of visible LED light onto semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). PFOS was completely defluorinated within 8&#8208;h irradiation of 405&#8208;nm LED light, and the turnover number of the C&#8211;F bond dissociation per NC was 17200. Furthermore, 81% defluorination of Nafion was achieved for 24&#8208;h light irradiation, demonstrating the efficient photocatalytic properties under visible light. We revealed that this decomposition is driven by cooperative mechanisms involving light&#8208;induced ligand displacements and Auger&#8208;induced electron injections via hydrated electrons and higher excited states. This study not only demonstrates the feasibility of efficiently breaking down various PFASs and FPs under mild conditions but also paves the way for advancing toward a sustainable fluorine&#8208;recycling society.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Cracking of Non&#8208;Biodegradable Plastics to Chemicals and Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastic pollution is worsening the living conditions on Earth, primarily due to the toxicity and stability of non&#8208;biodegradable plastics (NBPs). Photocatalytic cracking of NBPs is emerging as a promising way to cleave inert C&#8211;C bonds and abstract the carbon atoms from these wastes into valuable chemicals and fuels. However, controlling these processes is a huge challenge, ascribed to the complicated reactions of various NBPs. Herein, we summarize recent advances in the CO2 and carbon&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated photocatalytic cracking of NBPs, with an emphasis on the pivotal intermediates. The CO2&#8208;mediated cracking proceeded with indiscriminate C&#8211;H/C&#8211;C bond cleavage of NBPs and tandem photoreduction of CO2, while carbon&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated cracking was realized by the prior activation of C&#8211;H bonds for selective C&#8211;C bond cleavage of NBPs. Catalytic generation and conversion of different intermediates greatly depend on the kinds of active species and the structure of photocatalysts under light irradiation. Meanwhile, the fate of a specific intermediate is compared with small molecule activation to reveal the key problems in the cracking of NBPs. Finally, the challenges and potential directions are discussed to improve the overall efficiency in the photocatalytic cracking of NBPs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the aim of producing a photomechanical material for incorporation in soft microrobots, a one&#8208;dimensional diene coordination polymer (CP) [Cd(F&#8208;bpeb)(3&#8208;CBA)2]n (CP1, F&#8208;bpeb = 4,4'&#8208;((1E,1'E)&#8208;(2,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene)bis(ethene&#8208;2,1&#8208;diyl))dipyri&#8208;dine, 3&#8208;HCBA = 3&#8208;chlorobenzoic acid) was synthesized and characterized. Irradiation of CP1 with ultraviolet (UV) or visible light causes [2+2] photocycloaddition reactions resulting in the introduction of crystal strain which triggers various types of crystal movements. Composite films of CP1&#8208;PVA (SC) fabricated by dispersing CP1 crystals into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution allow amplification of the crystal movement so that the film strips exhibit fast and flexible curling upon photoirradiation. The composite films may be cut into long rectangular strips and folded to simulate soft microrobots which exhibit a variety of fast, flexible and continuous photomechanical movements resembling a human performing various gymnastic exercises.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Chirality Switching of a Dye&#8208;Grafted Helical Polymer Film Driven by Acid &amp; Base</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stimuli&#8208;responsive multiple chirality switching material, which can regulate opposed chiral absorption characteristics, has great application value in the fields of optical modulation, information storage and encryption, etc. However, due to the rareness of effective functional systems and the complexity of material structures, developing this type of material remains an insurmountable challenge. Herein, a smart polymer film with multiple chirality inversion properties was fabricated efficiently based on a newlydesigned acid &amp; base&#8208;sensitive dye&#8208;grafted helical polymer. Benefited from the cooperative effects of various weak interactions (hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interaction, etc.) under the aggregated state, this polymer film exhibited a promising acid &amp; base&#8208;driven multiple chirality inversion property containing record switchable chiral states (up to five while the solution showed three&#8208;state switching) and good reversibility. The creative exploration of such a multiple chirality switching material can not only promote the application progress of current chiroptical regulation technologybut also provide a significant guidance for the design and synthesis of future smart chiroptical switching materials and devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Antifouling Asymmetric Block Copolymer Nanofilms via Freestanding Interfacial Polymerization for Efficient and Sustainable Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane materials that resist nonspecific or specific adsorption are urgently required in widespread applications. In water purification, inevitable membrane fouling not only limits separation performance, but also remarkably increases operation requirements, and augments extra maintenance costs and higher energy consumption. In this work, we report a freestanding interfacial polymerization (IP) fabrication strategy for in&#8208;situ creation of asymmetric block copolymer (BCP) nanofilms with antifouling properties, greatly outperforming the conventional surface post&#8208;modification approaches. The resultant asymmetric BCP nanofilms with highly&#8208;dense, highly&#8208;hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) brushes, can be readily formed via a typical IP process of a double&#8208;hydrophilic BCP composed of an antifouling PEG block and a membrane&#8208;forming multiamine block. The asymmetric BCP nanofilms have been applied for efficient and sustainable natural water purification, demonstrating extraordinary antifouling capabilities accompanied with superior separation performance far beyond commercial polyamide nanofiltration membranes. The antifouling behaviors of BCP nanofilms derived from the combined effect of the hydration layer, electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance were further elucidated by water flux and fouling resistance in combination with all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulation. This work opens up a new avenue for large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost creation of broad&#8208;spectrum, asymmetric membrane materials with diverse functional &#8220;defect&#8208;free&#8221; surfaces in real&#8208;world applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;based mixed polyanion phosphate Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) is recognized as a promising cathode for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost and environmental friendliness. However, its inherent low conductivity and sluggish Na+ diffusion limit fast charge and low&#8208;temperature sodium storage. This study pioneers a scalable synthesis of hollow core&#8208;shelled Na4Fe2.4Ni0.6(PO4)2P2O7 with tiny&#8208;void space (THoCS&#8208;0.6Ni) via a one&#8208;step spray&#8208;drying combined with calcination process due to the different viscosity, coordination ability, molar ratios, and shrinkage rates between citric acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone. This unique structure with interconnected carbon networks ensures rapid electron transport and fast Na+ diffusion, as well as efficient space utilization for relieve volume expansion. Incorporating regulation of lattice structure by doping Ni heteroatom to effectively improve intrinsic electron and Na+ diffusion path and energy barrier, which achieves fast charge and low&#8208;temperature sodium storage. As a result, THoCS&#8208;0.6Ni exhibits superior rate capability (86.4 mAh g&#8208;1 at 25 C). Notably, THoCS&#8208;0.6Ni demonstrates exceptional cycling stability at &#8208;20 &#176;C with a capacity of 43.6 mAh g&#8208;1 after 2500 cycles at 5 C.

However, its inherent low conductivity and sluggish Na+ diffusion limit fast charge and low-temperature sodium storage. This study pioneers a scalable synthesis of hollow core-shelled Na4Fe2.4Ni0.6(PO4)2P2O7 with tiny-void space (THoCS-0.6Ni) via a one-step spray-drying combined with calcination process due to the different viscosity, coordination ability, molar ratios, and shrinkage rates between citric acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone.

Incorporating regulation of lattice structure by doping Ni heteroatom to effectively improve intrinsic electron and Na+ diffusion path and energy barrier, which achieves fast charge and low-temperature sodium storage. As a result, THoCS-0.6Ni exhibits superior rate capability (86.4 mAh g-1 at 25 C). Notably, THoCS-0.6Ni demonstrates exceptional cycling stability at -20 &#176;C with a capacity of 43.6 mAh g-1 after 2500 cycles at 5 C.

         <title>A Direct Route to closo&#8208;SB n Cl n  Thiaboranes from Simple Electron&#8208;Precise Synthons: The Different Role of Chalcogen Bonding in SB5Cl5 and SB11Cl11 Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Six&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;SB5Cl5 (1) and ten&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;1&#8208;SB9Cl9 (2) thiaboranes have been prepared, besides the already known 12&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;SB11Cl11 (3), from the co&#8208;pyrolysis reaction of B2Cl4 with S2Cl2 at 280 &#186;C in vacuo. The compounds are sublimable, off&#8208;white solids. Their elemental composition has been determined by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. They were further characterized by one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional 11B&#8208;spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray structure determination for 1 and 3. Ab initio/GIAO/NMR computations support octahedral, bicapped square&#8208;antiprismatic, and icosahedral geometries for 1, 2 and 3, respectively, as expected based on their closo&#8208;electron counts. 1 is the first isolated example of a neutral polyhedral closo&#8208;thiaborane with a cluster size smaller than ten vertices. The&#160;solid&#8208;state structure of 3 is one of the rare examples of a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination of an icosahedral heteroborane reported. The corresponding crystal&#8208;packing forces show the different role of chalcogen bonding in these octahedral and icosahedral crystals. In addition, there is a mass&#8208;spectroscopy evidence for the recurrent formation of further thiaborane homologs of closo&#8208;SBnCln with n = 4, 6, 10, and supra&#8208;icosahedral 12.</dc:description>

         <title>Clustering&#8208;resistant Cu Single Atoms on Porous Au Nanoparticles Supported by TiO2 for Sustainable Photoconversion of CO2 into CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysts based on single atoms (SAs) modification can lead to unprecedented reactivity with recent advances. However, the deactivation of SAs&#8208;modified photocatalysts remains a critical challenge in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. In this study, we unveil the detrimental effect of CO intermediates on Cu single atoms (Cu&#8208;SAs) during photocatalytic CO2 reduction, leading to clustering and deactivation on TiO2. To address this, we developed a novel Cu&#8208;SAs anchored on Au porous nanoparticles (CuAu&#8208;SAPNPs&#8208;TiO2) via a vectored etching approach. This system not only enhances CH4 production with a rate of 748.8 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 and 93.1% selectivity but also mitigates Cu&#8208;SAs clustering, maintaining stability over 7 days. This sustained high performance, despite the exceptionally high efficiency and selectivity in CH4 production, highlights the CuAu&#8208;SAPNPs&#8208;TiO2 overarching superior photocatalytic properties. Consequently, this work underscores the potential of tailored SAs&#8208;based systems for efficient and durable CO2 reduction by reshaping surface adsorption dynamics and optimizing the thermodynamic behavior of the SAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Asymmetric Acyl Radical Truce Smiles Rearrangement for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;Aryl Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is a straightforward strategy for incorporating aryl groups into organic molecules for which asymmetric processes remains rare. By employing a readily available and non&#8208;expensive chiral auxiliary, we developed a highly efficient asymmetric photocatalytic acyl and alkyl radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylamides using tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a hydrogen atom&#8211;transfer photocatalyst, along with aldehydes or C&#8208;H containing precursors. The rearranged products exhibited excellent diastereoselectivities (7:1 to &gt;98:2 d.r.) and chiral auxiliary was easily removed. Mechanistic studies allowed understanding the transformation in which density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the stereochemistry&#8208;determining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Thioesters from Aryl Halides and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioesters are important in synthesis, materials science, and biology, and their preparation traditionally relies on the use of disagreeable thiols. Here, we report a thiol&#8208;free protocol that stitches together widespread carboxylic acids and aryl halides, producing a diverse array of thioesters. Crucial to this strategy is the discovery that tetramethylthiourea can serve as both a sulfur source and, upon direct excitation by purple light, as a strong reductant, suitable for activating aryl halides via single&#8208;electron transfer. Coupling of the resulting aryl radicals provides an isothiouronium ion intermediate, which can be attacked by carboxylic acids via a polar pathway, affording the thioester products under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Anion Conductive Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes with Hierarchical Ionic Highways for Flexible Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries are leading power sources for next&#8208;generation smart wearable electronics. However, flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries suffer from the highly&#8208;corrosive safety risk and limited lifespan due to the absence of reliable solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Herein, a single&#8208;anion conductive SSE with high&#8208;safety is constructed by incorporating a highly amorphous dual&#8208;cation ionomer into a robust hybrid matrix of functional carbon nanotubes and polyacrylamide polymer. The as&#8208;fabricated SSE obtains dual&#8208;penetrating ionomer&#8208;polymer networks and hierarchical ionic highways, which contribute to mechanical robustness with 1200% stretchability, decent water uptake and retention, and superhigh ion conductivity of 245 mS&#183;cm&#8208;1 and good Zn anode reversibility. Remarkably, the flexible solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air batteries delivers a high specific capacity of 764 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 and peak power density of 152 mW&#183;cm&#8208;2 as well as sustains excellent cycling stability for 1050 cycles (350 hours. This work offers a new paradigm of OH&#8208; conductors and broadens the definition and scope of OH&#8208; conductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Axial Ligand Enables Synthesis of Allenylsilane through Dirhodium(II) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described herein is a dirhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed silylation of propargyl esters with hydrosilanes, using tertiary amines as axial ligands. By adopting this strategy, a range of versatile and useful allenylsilanes can be achieved with good yields. This reaction not only represents a SN2'&#8208;type silylation of the propargyl derivatives bearing a terminal alkyne moiety to synthesize allenylsilanes from simple hydrosilanes, but also represents a new application of dirhodium(II) complexes in catalytic transformation of carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond. The highly functionalized allenylsilanes that are produced can be transformed into a series of synthetically useful organic molecules. In this reaction, an intriguing ON&#8208;OFF effect of the amine ligand was observed. The reaction almost did not occur (OFF) without addition of Lewis base amine ligand. However, the reaction took place smoothly (ON) after addition of only catalytic amount of amine ligand. Detailed mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the reactivity can be delicately improved by the use of tertiary amine. The fine&#8208;tuning effect of the tertiary amine is crucial in the formation of the Rh&#8208;Si species via a concerted metalation deprotonation&#160;(CMD) mechanism and facilitating &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene)&#8208;Capped Alloy and Core&#8208;Shell AuAg Bimetallic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized metal nanoparticles (NPs) have recently attracted considerable attention. While most efforts in the field have been devoted to the development of NHC&#8208;tethered monometallic NPs and enhancing their stabilities under various conditions, their bimetallic counterparts are rare in the literature. Herein, we demonstrate that the covalent immobilization of Au and Ag atoms on polymerized NHCs is a powerful method to access bimetallic AuAg NPs. In addition, we show that while AuAg alloy NPs are often obtained via this method, the use of bimetallic polymeric substrates with lower Ag content, relative to Au, results in the formation of core&#8208;shell NPs with Au core and Ag shell. Application of these nanomaterials for oxygen reduction reaction is demonstrated with&#160;all materials exhibiting electrocatalytic activity. This work demonstrates for the first time that while bimetallic poly(NHC&#8208;metal)s are viable substrates to access NHC&#8208;stabilized bimetallic NPs, careful adjustment of metal content in the polymeric substrates can finetune the microstructure of the resulting NPs, i.e. alloy vs. core&#8208;shell.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;N-Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-stabilized metal nanoparticles (NPs) have recently attracted considerable attention.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Selenol&#8208;Yne Click (SYC) Reaction Enables&#160;Poly(selenoacetal) Covalent Adaptable Network&#160;Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) based on dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) presents a promising avenue for achieving resource recovery and utilization. In this study, we discovered a novel dynamic covalent bond called selenacetal, which is obtained through a double click reaction between selenol and activated alkynes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the &#916;G for the formation of selenoacetals ranges from 12 to 18 kJ mol&#8208;1, suggesting its potential for dynamic reversibility. Dynamic exchange experiments involving small molecules and polymers provide substantial evidence supporting the dynamic exchange properties of selenoacetals. By utilizing this highly efficient click reaction, we successfully synthesized dynamic materials based on selenoacetal with remarkable reprocessing capabilities without any catalysts. These materials exhibit chemical recycling under alkaline conditions, wherein selenoacetal (SA) can decompose into active enone selenide (ES) and diselenides. Reintroducing selenol initiates a renewed reaction with the enone selenide, facilitating material recycling and yielding a newly developed dynamic material exhibiting both photo&#8208; and thermal responsiveness. The results underscore the potential of selenoacetal polymers in terms of recyclability and selective degradation, making them a valuable addition to conventional covalent adaptable networks.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable carbamazepine analogs for non&#8208;invasive neuroinhibition in vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A problem of systemic pharmacotherapy is off&#8208;target activity, which causes adverse effects. Outstanding examples include neuroinhibitory medications like antiseizure drugs, which are used against epilepsy and neuropathic pain but cause systemic side effects. There is a need of drugs that inhibit nerve signals locally and on&#8208;demand without affecting other regions of the body. Photopharmacology aims to address this problem with light&#8208;activated drugs and localized illumination in the target organ. Here, we have developed photoswitchable derivatives of the widely prescribed antiseizure drug carbamazepine. For that purpose, we expanded our method of ortho azologization of tricyclic drugs to meta/para and to N&#8208;bridged diazocine. Our results validate the concept of ortho cryptoazologs (uniquely exemplified by Carbazopine&#8208;1) and bring to light Carbadiazocine (8), which can be photoswitched between 400&#8208;590 nm light (using violet LEDs and halogen lamps) and shows good drug&#8208;likeness and predicted safety. Both compounds display photoswitchable activity in vitro and in translucent zebrafish larvae. Carbadiazocine (8) also offers in vivo analgesic efficacy (mechanical and thermal stimuli) in a rat model of neuropathic pain and a simple and compelling treatment demonstration with non&#8208;invasive illumination.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Doped Bismuth Nanosheet Catalyst for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Electrolyte&#8208;Free Formic acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) to valuable liquid fuels, such as formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO&#8722;) is a promising strategy for carbon neutrality. Enhancing CO&#173;2RR activity while retaining high selectivity is critical for commercialization. To address this, we developed metal&#8208;doped bismuth (Bi) nanosheets via a facile hydrolysis method. These doped nanosheets efficiently generated high&#8208;purity HCOOH using a porous solid electrolyte (PSE) layer. Among the evaluated metal&#8208;doped Bi catalysts, Co&#8208;doped Bi demonstrated improved CO2RR performance compared to pristine Bi, achieving ~90% HCOO&#8722; selectivity and boosted activity with a low overpotential of ~1.0 V at a current density of 200 mA cm&#8208;2. In a solid electrolyte reactor, Co&#8208;doped Bi maintained HCOOH Faradaic efficiency of ~72% after a 100&#8208;hour operation under a current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2, generating 0.1 M HCOOH at 3.2 V. Density functional theory (DFT) results revealed that Co&#8208;doped Bi required a lower applied potential for HCOOH generation from CO2, due to stronger binding energy to the key intermediates OCHO* compared to pure Bi. This study shows that metal doping in Bi nanosheets modifies the chemical composition, element distribution, and morphology, improving CO2RR catalytic activity performance by tuning surface adsorption affinity and reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Inducing Immunogenic Cancer Cell Death through Oxygen&#8208;Economized Photodynamic Therapy with Nitric Oxide&#8208;Releasing Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizes reactive oxygen species (ROS) for eradication of cancer cells. Its effectiveness is governed by the oxygen content, which is scarce in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. We report herein two zinc(II) phthalocyanines substituted with two or four nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing moieties, namely ZnPc&#8208;2NO and ZnPc&#8208;4NO, which can suppress the mitochondrial respiration, thereby sparing more intracellular oxygen for PDT. Using HT29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and A549 human lung carcinoma cells, we have demonstrated that both conjugates release NO upon interaction with the intracellular glutathione, which can reduce the cellular oxygen consumption rate and adenosine triphosphate generation and alter the mitochondrial membrane potential. They can also relieve the hypoxic status of cancer cells and decrease the expression of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor protein HIF&#8208;1&#945;. Upon light irradiation, both conjugates can generate ROS and induce cytotoxicity even under a hypoxic condition, overcoming the oxygen&#8208;dependent nature of PDT. Interestingly, the photodynamic action of ZnPc&#8208;2NO elicits the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, inducing the maturation of dendritic cells and triggering an antitumor immune response. The immunogenic cell death caused by this oxygen&#8208;economized PDT has been demonstrated through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
The gram&#8208;scale synthesis of acremolactone&#8197;B, a pyridine&#8208;containing azaphilone&#8208;type polyketide, has been achieved by using an aza&#8208;6&#960; electrocyclization strategy.







Abstract
Acremolactone&#8197;B is a pyridine&#8208;containing azaphilone&#8208;type polyketide. The first total synthesis of this molecule was achieved on a gram scale, based on an aza&#8208;6&#960; electrocyclization&#8211;aromatization strategy for construction of the tetra&#8208;substituted pyridine ring. A bicyclic intermediate was expeditiously prepared by using [2+2] photocycloaddition and chemoselective Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation, which was further elaborated to a densely substituted aza&#8208;triene. An electrocyclization&#8211;aromatization cascade was utilized to forge the tetracyclic core of this natural product, and the side chain was introduced through diastereoselective acylation and reduction.

We present the first combination of a paper&#8208;based bipolar electrode with mass spectrometry to address the need not only to capture ultrafast dynamics in chemistry, but also to access complementary structural information from diverse reaction scenarios and to explore electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
Capturing short&#8208;lived intermediates at the molecular level is key to understanding the mechanism and dynamics of chemical reactions. Here, we have developed a paper&#8208;in&#8208;tip bipolar electrolytic electrospray mass spectrometry platform, in which a piece of triangular conductive paper incorporated into a plastic pipette tip serves not only as an electrospray emitter but also as a bipolar electrode (BPE), thus triggering both electrospray and electrolysis simultaneously upon application of a high voltage. The bipolar electrolysis induces a pair of redox reactions on both sides of BPE, enabling both electro&#8208;oxidation and electro&#8208;reduction processes regardless of the positive or negative ion mode, thus facilitating access to complementary structural information for mechanism elucidation. Our method enables real&#8208;time monitoring of transient intermediates (such as N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline radical cation, dopamine o&#8208;quinone (DAQ) and sulfenic acid with half&#8208;lives ranging from microseconds to minutes) and transient processes (such as DAQ cyclization with a rate constant of 0.15&#8197;s&#8722;1). This platform also provides key insights into electrocatalytic reactions such as Fe (III)&#8208;catalyzed dopamine oxidation to quinone species at physiological pH for neuromelanin formation.

         <title>Unnatural Direct Interspecies Electron Transfer Enabled by Living Cell&#8208;Cell Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seamless connection between different bacterial species was achieved by living cell&#8208;cell click chemistry, enabling the establishment of an unnatural C&#8208;type cytochrome based direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) pathway. The process resulted in an unprecedented interspecies electron transfer pathway shift for highly efficient interspecies electron exchange and opens up new avenues for DIET exploration, understanding, and engineering.







Abstract
Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) is essential for maintaining the function and stability of anaerobic microbial consortia. However, only limited natural DIET modes have been identified and DIET engineering remains highly challenging. In this study, an unnatural DIET between Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 (SO, electron donating partner) and Rhodopseudomonas palustris (RP, electron accepting partner) was artificially established by a facile living cell&#8208;cell click chemistry strategy. By introducing alkyne&#8208; or azide&#8208;modified monosaccharides onto the cell outer surface of the target species, precise covalent connections between different species in high proximity were realized through a fast click chemistry reaction. Remarkably, upon covalent connection, outer cell surface C&#8208;type cytochromes mediated DIET between SO and RP was achieved and identified, although this was never realized naturally. Moreover, this connection directly shifted the natural H2 mediated interspecies electron transfer (MIET) to DIET between SO and RP, which delivered superior interspecies electron exchange efficiency. Therefore, this work demonstrated a naturally unachievable DIET and an unprecedented MIET shift to DIET accomplished by cell&#8208;cell distance engineering, offering an efficient and versatile solution for DIET engineering, which extends our understanding of DIET and opens up new avenues for DIET exploration and applications.

         <title>Orthogonal Radical and Cationic Single&#8208;Unit Monomer Insertions for Engineering Polymer Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By optimizing the monomer and chain transfer agent pairs and making necessary adjustments to the reaction conditions, we have successfully developed the orthogonal single&#8208;unit monomer insertions (SUMIs) technique. This technique allows for the simultaneous implementation of radical and cationic SUMI reactions in a single reaction vessel without any mutual interference.







Abstract
The single&#8208;unit monomer insertion (SUMI), derived from living/controlled polymerization, can be directly functionalized at the end or within the chain of polymers prepared by living/controlled polymerization, offering potential applications in the preparation of polymers with complex architectures. Many scenarios demand the simultaneous incorporation of monomers suitable for different polymerization methods into complex polymers. Therefore, it becomes imperative to utilize SUMI technologies with diverse mechanisms, especially those that are compatible with each other. Here, we reported the orthogonal SUMI technique, seamlessly combining radical and cationic SUMI approaches. Through the careful optimization of monomer and chain transfer agent pairs and adjustments to reaction conditions, we can efficiently execute both radical and cationic SUMI processes in one pot without mutual interference. The utilization of orthogonal SUMI pairs facilitates the integration of radical and cationic reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in various configurations. This flexibility enables the synthesis of diblock, triblock, and star polymers that incorporate both cationically and radically polymerizable monomers. Moreover, we have successfully implemented a mixing mechanism of free radicals and cations in RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization, resulting in the creation of a side&#8208;chain sequence&#8208;controlled polymer brushes.

         <title>Reverse Separation of Carbon Dioxide and Acetylene in Two Isostructural Copper Pyridine&#8208;Carboxylate Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different pore structures can adjust binding configurations of CO2 and C2H2 molecules in two isoreticular ultramicroporous MOFs to show selective adsorption of CO2 over C2H2 for efficient purification of C2H2.







Abstract
Separating acetylene from carbon dioxide is important but highly challenging due to their similar molecular shapes and physical properties. Adsorptive separation of carbon dioxide from acetylene can directly produce pure acetylene but is hardly realized because of relatively polarizable acetylene binds more strongly. Here, we reverse the CO2 and C2H2 separation by adjusting the pore structures in two isoreticular ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Under ambient conditions, copper isonicotinate (Cu(ina)2), with relatively large pore channels shows C2H2&#8208;selective adsorption with a C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 3.4, whereas its smaller&#8208;pore analogue, copper quinoline&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylate (Cu(Qc)2) shows an inverse CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 5.6. Cu(Qc)2 shows compact pore space that well matches the optimal orientation of CO2 but is not compatible for C2H2. Neutron powder diffraction experiments confirmed that CO2 molecules adopt preferential orientation along the pore channels during adsorption binding, whereas C2H2 molecules bind in an opposite fashion with distorted configurations due to their opposite quadrupole moments. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have validated the separation performance of Cu(Qc)2 for CO2/C2H2 separation.

         <title>Zwitterionic Cellulose&#8208;Based Polymer Electrolyte Enabled by Aqueous Solution Casting for High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new PEO&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte (PL&#8208;ZCNF) is synthesized by integrating zwitterionic cellulose nanofiber (ZCNF) into PEO matrix mixed with LiTFSI, using a straightforward and eco&#8208;friendly aqueous solution casting method. Due to the unique zwitterionic properties, PL&#8208;ZCNF enables an optimized balance between Li ionic conductivity and mechanical strength, as well as the resultant extraordinary long&#8208;term cyclability in full and punch cells.







Abstract
Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries hold great promise as the next&#8208;generation batteries with high energy density and high safety. However, PEO&#8208;based electrolytes encounter certain limitations, including inferior ionic conductivity, low Li+ transference number, and poor mechanical strength. Herein, we aim to simultaneously address these issues by utilizing one&#8208;dimensional zwitterionic cellulose nanofiber (ZCNF) as fillers for PEO&#8208;based electrolytes using a simple aqueous solution casting method. Multiple characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the unique zwitterionic structure imparts ZCNF with various functions, such as disrupting PEO crystallization, dissociating lithium salts, anchoring anions through cationic groups, accelerating Li+ migration by anionic groups, as well as its inherent reinforcement effect. As a result, the prepared PL&#8208;ZCNF electrolyte exhibits remarkable ionic conductivity (5.37&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.62) at 60&#8201;&#176;C without sacrificing mechanical strength (9.2&#8197;MPa), together with high critical current density of 1.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Attributed to these merits of PL&#8208;ZCNF, the LiFePO4|PL&#8208;ZCNF|Li solid&#8208;state full&#8208;cell delivers exceptional rate capability and cycling performance (900&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C). Notably, the assembled pouch&#8208;cell can maintain steady operation over 1000&#8197;cycles with an impressive 93.7&#8201;% capacity retention at 0.5&#8197;C and 60&#8201;&#176;C, highlighting the great potential of PL&#8208;ZCNF for practical applications.

As a result, the prepared PL-ZCNF electrolyte exhibits remarkable ionic conductivity (5.37&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number (0.62) at 60&#8201;&#176;C without sacrificing mechanical strength (9.2&#8197;MPa), together with high critical current density of 1.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Attributed to these merits of PL-ZCNF, the LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;|PL-ZCNF|Li solid-state full-cell delivers exceptional rate capability and cycling performance (900&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C). Notably, the assembled pouch-cell can maintain steady operation over 1000&#8197;cycles with an impressive 93.7&#8201;% capacity retention at 0.5&#8197;C and 60&#8201;&#176;C, highlighting the great potential of PL-ZCNF for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanical Strain Induces and Increases Vesicular Release Monitored by Microfabricated Stretchable Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has reported the fabrication of stretchable microelectrodes and achieved real&#8208;time quantifying of strain&#8208;induced catecholamine release from single vesicles. The results proved that mechanical strain could trigger the exocytotic events by activating Piezo1 channel and increase catecholamine release by accelerating the opening and prolonging the closure of fusion pores.







Abstract
Exocytosis involving the fusion of intracellular vesicles with cell membrane, is thought to be modulated by the mechanical cues in the microenvironment. Single&#8208;cell electrochemistry can offer unique information about the quantification and kinetics of exocytotic events; however, the effects of mechanical force on vesicular release have been poorly explored. Herein, we developed a stretchable microelectrode with excellent electrochemical stability under mechanical deformation by microfabrication of functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) conductive ink, which achieved real&#8208;time quantitation of strain&#8208;induced vesicular exocytosis from a single cell for the first time. We found that mechanical strain could cause calcium influx via the activation of Piezo1 channels in chromaffin cell, initiating the vesicular exocytosis process. Interestingly, mechanical strain increases the amount of catecholamines released by accelerating the opening and prolonging the closing of fusion pore during exocytosis. This work is expected to provide revealing insights into the regulatory effects of mechanical stimuli on vesicular exocytosis.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Responsive Peptide&#8208;Based Ultrathin Nanosheets Prepared by a Horizontal Monolayer Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;based ultrathin nanosheets with a thickness of ~1&#8197;nm were prepared via a hierarchical covalent physical approach and enabled by two&#8208;dimensional horizontal monolayer self&#8208;assembly. The ultrathin nanosheets can respond to various external stimuli and transform into diverse morphologies, with morphological changes in response to pH, allowing them to selectively inhibit cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
In this study, peptide&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled nanosheets with a thickness of approximately 1&#8197;nm were prepared using a hierarchical covalent physical fabrication strategy. The covalent alternating polymerization of helical peptide E3 with an azobenzene (AZO) structure yielded copolymers CoP(E3&#8208;AZO), which physically self&#8208;assembled into ultrathin nanosheets in an unanticipated two&#8208;dimensional horizontal monolayer arrangement. This special monolayer arrangement enabled the thickness of the nanosheets to be equal to the cross&#8208;sectional diameter of a single linear copolymer, which is a rare phenomenon. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the synergistic effect of multiple molecular interactions drives the self&#8208;assembly of CoP(E3&#8208;AZO) into nanosheets and that various methods, including phototreatment, pH adjustment, the addition of additives, and introduction of cosolvents, can alter the molecular interactions and modulate the self&#8208;assembly of CoP(E3&#8208;AZO), yielding diverse nanostructures. Remarkably, the ultrathin nanosheets selectively inhibited cancer cells at certain concentrations.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Photoswitching Reagent for Super&#8208;Resolution Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy, which is one of the most widely used super&#8208;resolution microscopy techniques, relies on the photoswitching of fluorophores. According to the photoswitching mechanism proposed by Doory Kim et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202405246), the rate of switch&#8208;off is determined by the nucleophilicity of the photoswitching reagent, whereas the rate of switch&#8208;on, which is a two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced dissociation process, is determined by the bond dissociation energy of the photoswitching reagent&#8211;fluorophore pair.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Ortho&#8208;Donor&#8208;Modification of Boracyclic &#960;&#8208;Electron Systems beyond Steric Protection to Produce Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of a boracyclic &#960;&#8208;skeleton with only sp2 carbons and electron&#8208;donating phenothiazinyl groups resulted in a short ortho B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N distance. Owing to their donor&#8211;acceptor structures, these compounds exhibited thermally activated delayed orange&#8208;red fluorescence when doped into thin films. In organic light emitting diodes, a bis&#8208;ortho&#8208;donor&#8208;substituted derivative exhibited better performance than the corresponding mono&#8208;substituted congener.







Abstract
Polycyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds that contain tricoordinate boron atoms at their periphery represent an attractive class of materials with electron&#8208;accepting character. Their molecular design generally requires the introduction of a bulky aryl group onto the boron atom, where it provides predominantly kinetic stabilization. The addition of extra functionality to the aryl group on the boron atom can be expected to further expand the potential utility of this class of materials. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of boracyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules with firm ortho B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N nonbonding interactions by introducing N&#8208;containing electron&#8208;donors at the ortho&#8208;positions of the aryl group on the boron atom. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the combination of a planar boracyclic &#960;&#8208;skeleton with only sp2 carbons and a strong electron&#8208;donating phenothiazine moiety results in a particularly short B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N distance. Theoretical study provided insights into the inherent nature of the B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interaction. Owing to their donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structures, these molecules exhibit substantially red&#8208;shifted fluorescence in solution, albeit that the fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) are low. In contrast, when incorporated into films, these compounds exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with improved &#934;F values. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) fabricated using the ortho&#8208;donor&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibit orange&#8208;red electroluminescence.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Control in Dysprosium(III) Metallacrown Magnets via Thioacetal Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through thioacetal modification, a 3d&#8211;4f metallacrown with a square planar NiII successfully realized chemical&#8208;induced coordination&#8208;induced spin state switching (CISSS) and the spin state of NiII altering from low&#8208;spin S=0 to high&#8208;spin S=1. The synergy of CISSS effect and magnetic interactions results in distinct energy splitting and magnetic dynamics.







Abstract
Integrating controllable spin states into single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) enables precise manipulation of magnetic interactions at a molecular level, but remains a synthetic challenge. Herein, we developed a 3d&#8211;4f metallacrown (MC) magnet [DyNi5(quinha)5(Clsal)2(py)8](ClO4)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (H2quinha=quinaldichydroxamic acid, HClsal=5&#8208;chlorosalicylaldehyde) wherein a square planar NiII is stabilized by chemical stacking. Thioacetal modification was employed via post&#8208;synthetic ligand substitutions and yielded [DyNi5(quinha)5(Clsaldt)2(py)8](ClO4)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O (HClsaldt=4&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dithiolan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenol). Thanks to the additional ligations of thioacetal onto the NiII site, coordination&#8208;induced spin state switching (CISSS) took place with spin state altering from low&#8208;spin S=0 to high&#8208;spin S=1. The synergy of CISSS effect and magnetic interactions results in distinct energy splitting and magnetic dynamics. Magnetic studies indicate prominent enhancement of reversal barrier from 57&#8197;cm&#8722;1 to 423&#8197;cm&#8722;1, along with hysteresis opening and an over 200&#8208;fold increment in coercive field at 2&#8197;K. Ab initio calculations provide deeper insights into the exchange models and rationalize the relaxation/tunnelling pathways.

&lt;p&gt;Through thioacetal modification, a 3d&#8211;4f metallacrown with a square planar Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; successfully realized chemical-induced coordination-induced spin state switching (CISSS) and the spin state of Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; altering from low-spin &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=0 to high-spin &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=1. The synergy of CISSS effect and magnetic interactions results in distinct energy splitting and magnetic dynamics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating controllable spin states into single-molecule magnets (SMMs) enables precise manipulation of magnetic interactions at a molecular level, but remains a synthetic challenge. Herein, we developed a 3d&#8211;4f metallacrown (MC) magnet [DyNi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(quinha)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;Cl&lt;/sup&gt;sal)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(py)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;](ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;quinha=quinaldichydroxamic acid, H&lt;sup&gt;Cl&lt;/sup&gt;sal=5-chlorosalicylaldehyde) wherein a square planar Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; is stabilized by chemical stacking. Thioacetal modification was employed via post-synthetic ligand substitutions and yielded [DyNi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(quinha)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;Cl&lt;/sup&gt;saldt)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(py)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;](ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (H&lt;sup&gt;Cl&lt;/sup&gt;saldt=4-chloro-2-(1,3-dithiolan-2-yl)phenol). Thanks to the additional ligations of thioacetal onto the Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; site, coordination-induced spin state switching (CISSS) took place with spin state altering from low-spin &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=0 to high-spin &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=1. The synergy of CISSS effect and magnetic interactions results in distinct energy splitting and magnetic dynamics. Magnetic studies indicate prominent enhancement of reversal barrier from 57&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; to 423&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, along with hysteresis opening and an over 200-fold increment in coercive field at 2&#8197;K. &lt;i&gt;Ab initio&lt;/i&gt; calculations provide deeper insights into the exchange models and rationalize the relaxation/tunnelling pathways. These results demonstrate here provide a fire-new perspective in modulating the magnetization relaxation via the incorporation of controllable spin states and magnetic interactions facilitated by the CISSS approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct ortho&#8208;Arylation of Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broadly applicable rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct ortho&#8208;arylation of anilines with (hetero)aryl halides based on readily available aminophosphines as traceless directing groups is reported. The ortho&#8208;arylated anilines could be obtained in high yields, without any competing diarylation and with full regioselectivity. The catalytic cycle was elucidated by DFT and supporting experiments.







Abstract
An efficient and broadly applicable rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct ortho&#8208;arylation of anilines with aryl iodides relying on readily available aminophosphines as traceless directing groups is reported. Its scope and functional group compatibility were both found to be quite broad as a large variety of both aminophosphines and (hetero)aryl iodides, including complex ones, could be utilized. The ortho&#8208;arylated anilines could be obtained in high average yields, without any competing diarylation and with full regioselectivity, which constitutes a major step forward compared to other processes. The reaction is moreover not limited to aryl iodides, as an aryl bromide and a triflate could be successfully used, and could be extended to diarylation. Mechanistic studies revealed the key and unique role of the aminophosphine, acting not only as a substrate but also as a ligand for the rhodium catalyst.

         <title>2D Exfoliation Chemistry Towards Covalent Pseudo&#8208;Layered Phosphate Framework Derived by Radical/Strain&#8208;Synergistical Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong ionic/covalent bonding usually requires more aggressive pathways for effective exfoliation purposes. Here, we propose for the first time a radical/strain synergistic strategy for exfoliation of non&#8208;van der Waals interacting pseudolamellar phosphate frameworks. Innovative 2D layered NASICON&#8208;type Na3V2(PO4)2O2F crystals exfoliated via &#8208;OH/H2O synergism exhibit significantly improved Na&#8208;storage properties compared to bulk frameworks.







Abstract
2D compounds exfoliated from weakly bonded bulk materials with van der Waals (vdW) interaction are easily accessible. However, the strong internal ionic/covalent bonding of most inorganic crystal frameworks greatly hinders 2D material exfoliation. Herein, we first proposed a radical/strain&#8208;synergistic strategy to exfoliate non&#8208;vdW interacting pseudo&#8208;layered phosphate framework. Specifically, hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) distort the covalent bond irreversibly, meanwhile, H2O molecules as solvents, further accelerating interlayered ionic bond breakage but mechanical expansion. The innovative 2D laminar NASICON&#8208;type Na3V2(PO4)2O2F crystal, exfoliated by &#8901;OH/H2O synergistic strategy, exhibits enhanced sodium&#8208;ion storage capacity, high&#8208;rate performance (85.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;C), cyclic life (2300 cycles), and ion migration rates, compared with the bulk framework. Importantly, this chemical/physical dual driving technique realized the effective exfoliation for strongly coupled pseudo&#8208;layered frameworks, which accelerates 2D functional material development.

         <title>Sono&#8208;Triggered Cascade Lactate Depletion by Semiconducting Polymer Nanoreactors for Cuproptosis&#8208;Immunotherapy of Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting polymer nanoreactor is developed to achieve sono&#8208;triggered cascade lactate depletion for cuproptosis&#8208;immunotherapy. Upon ultrasound irradiation, this nanoreactor generates singlet oxygen to allow lactate oxidase release, leading to lactate depletion and hydrogen peroxide generation for promoting cuproptosis. This therapeutic strategy can observably restrict the growth of subcutaneous and deep&#8208;tissue orthotopic pancreatic cancer.







Abstract
The high level of lactate in tumor microenvironment not only promotes tumor development and metastasis, but also induces immune escape, which often leads to failures of various tumor therapy strategies. We here report a sono&#8208;triggered cascade lactate depletion strategy by using semiconducting polymer nanoreactors (SPNLCu) for cancer cuproptosis&#8208;immunotherapy. The SPNLCu mainly contain a semiconducting polymer as sonosensitizer, lactate oxidase (LOx) conjugated via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;cleavable linker and chelated Cu2+. Upon ultrasound (US) irradiation, the semiconducting polymer generates singlet oxygen (1O2) to cut ROS&#8208;cleavable linker to allow the release of LOx that catalyzes lactate depletion to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The Cu2+ will be reduced to Cu+ in tumor microenvironment, which reacts with the produced H2O2 to obtain hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) that further improves LOx release via destroying ROS&#8208;cleavable linkers. As such, sono&#8208;triggered cascade release of LOx achieves effective lactate depletion, thus relieving immunosuppressive roles of lactate. Moreover, the toxic Cu+ induces cuproptosis to cause immunogenic cell death (ICD) for activating antitumor immunological effect. SPNLCu are used to treat both subcutaneous and deep&#8208;tissue orthotopic pancreatic cancer with observably enhanced efficacy in restricting the tumor growths. This study thus provides a precise and effective lactate depletion tactic for cancer therapy.

         <title>A BRD4&#8208;Targeting Photothermal Agent for Controlled Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BRD4&#8208;targeting photothermal agent was developed for controlled protein degradation. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the photothermal agent could efficiently induce BRD4 protein degradation, inhibiting its transcriptional regulatory function and ultimately achieving low&#8208;temperature PTT of cancer cells.







Abstract
BRD4 protein plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and differentiation. Disrupting the activity of BRD4 has emerged as a promising strategy for inhibiting the growth and proliferation of cancer cells. Herein, we introduced a BRD4&#8208;targeting photothermal agent for controlled protein degradation, aiming to enhance low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy (PTT) for cancer treatment. By incorporating a BRD4 protein inhibitor into a cyanine dye scaffold, the photothermal agent specifically bond to the bromodomain of BRD4. Upon low power density laser irradiation, the agent induced protein degradation, directly destroying the BRD4 structure and inhibiting its transcriptional regulatory function. This strategy not only prolonged the retention time of the photothermal agent in cancer cells but also confined the targeted protein degradation process solely to the tumor tissue, minimizing side effects on normal tissues through the aid of exogenous signals. This work established a simple and feasible platform for future PTT agent design in clinical cancer treatment.

         <title>Tuning Ion Mobility in Lithium Argyrodite Solid Electrolytes via Entropy Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Configurational entropy in the cation sublattice, induced by complex substitution, shows a direct correlation with Li+ mobility in superionic lithium argyrodite solid electrolytes.







Abstract
The development of improved solid electrolytes (SEs) plays a crucial role in the advancement of bulk&#8208;type solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) technologies. In recent years, multicomponent or high&#8208;entropy SEs are gaining increased attention for their advantageous charge&#8208;transport and (electro)chemical properties. However, a comprehensive understanding of how configurational entropy affects ionic conductivity is largely lacking. Herein we investigate a series of multication&#8208;substituted lithium argyrodites with the general formula Li6+x[M1aM2bM3cM4d]S5I, with M being P, Si, Ge, and Sb. Structure&#8208;property relationships related to ion mobility are probed using a combination of diffraction techniques, solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and charge&#8208;transport measurements. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first experimental evidence of a direct correlation between occupational disorder in the cationic host lattice and lithium transport. By controlling the configurational entropy through compositional design, high bulk ionic conductivities up to 18&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature are achieved for optimized lithium argyrodites. Our results indicate the possibility of improving ionic conductivity in ceramic ion conductors via entropy engineering, overcoming compositional limitations for the design of advanced electrolytes and opening up new avenues in the field.

         <title>Thermal and Photoinduced Radical Cascade Annulation using Aryl Isonitriles: An Approach to Quinoline&#8208;Derived Benzophosphole Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of quinoline&#8208;based benzophosphole oxides from ortho&#8208;alkynylated aromatic phosphine oxides and aryl isonitriles is presented. These &#960;&#8208;extended benzophosphole oxides exhibit interesting photophysical and electrochemical properties.







Abstract
Herein, we present a radical cascade addition cyclization sequence to access quinoline&#8208;based benzophosphole oxides from ortho&#8208;alkynylated aromatic phosphine oxides using various aryl isonitriles as radical acceptors and inexpensive tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;hydroperoxide (TBHP) as a terminal oxidant in the presence of a catalytic amount of silver acetate. Alternatively, the same cascade can be realized through a sustainable photochemical approach utilizing 1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as an organic photocatalyst at room temperature. The introduced modular approach shows broad functional group tolerance and offers straightforward access to complex P,N&#8208;containing polyheterocyclic arenes. These novel &#960;&#8208;extended benzophosphole oxides exhibit interesting photophysical and electrochemical properties such as absorption in the visible region, emission and reversible reduction at low potentials, which makes them promising for potential materials science applications. The photophysical properties can further be tuned by the addition of external Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids.

         <title>Probing Particle&#8208;Carbon/Binder Degradation Behavior in Fatigued Layered Cathode Materials through Machine Learning Aided Diffraction Tomography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique combination of machine learning and &#956;&#8208;XRD CT has been used to unveil the spatial distribution of structure and microstrain in the fatigued layered materials. Smaller NCM622 particles and the surface of larger NCM622 particles in contact with the carbon/binder matrix experience intensified structural fatigue after long&#8208;term cycling. Serious structural fatigue occurs in both the surface and bulk of LLNMO particles during extended cycling.







Abstract
Understanding how reaction heterogeneity impacts cathode materials during Li&#8208;ion battery (LIB) electrochemical cycling is pivotal for unraveling their electrochemical performance. Yet, experimentally verifying these reactions has proven to be a challenge. To address this, we employed scanning &#956;&#8208;XRD computed tomography to scrutinize Ni&#8208;rich layered LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) and Li&#8208;rich layered Li[Li0.2Ni0.2Mn0.6]O2 (LLNMO). By harnessing machine learning (ML) techniques, we scrutinized an extensive dataset of &#956;&#8208;XRD patterns, about 100,000&#8197;patterns per slice, to unveil the spatial distribution of crystalline structure and microstrain. Our experimental findings unequivocally reveal the distinct behavior of these materials. NCM622 exhibits structural degradation and lattice strain intricately linked to the size of secondary particles. Smaller particles and the surface of larger particles in contact with the carbon/binder matrix experience intensified structural fatigue after long&#8208;term cycling. Conversely, both the surface and bulk of LLNMO particles endure severe strain&#8208;induced structural degradation during high&#8208;voltage cycling, resulting in significant voltage decay and capacity fade. This work holds the potential to fine&#8208;tune the microstructure of advanced layered materials and manipulate composite electrode construction in order to enhance the performance of LIBs and beyond.

         <title>Adaptive Response to Solvation in Flexible Molecules: Oligo Hydrates of 4&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise Hydration of a flexible organic molecule reveals how water solvation scaffolds deforms the substrate structure, generally through different structural pathways. In this experiment we observed solvation with up to five water molecules for 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone, using broadband microwave spectroscopy. Solvation is accompanied by multiple isomerization, as two isomers were rotationally detected for each cluster.







Abstract
Structural changes induced by water play a pivotal role in chemistry and biology but remain challenging to predict, measure, and control at molecular level. Here we explore size&#8208;governed gas&#8208;phase water aggregation in the flexible molecule 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone, modeling the conformational adaptability of flexible substrates to host water scaffolds and the preference for sequential droplet growth. The experiment was conducted using broadband rotational spectroscopy, rationalized with quantum chemical calculations. Two different isomers were observed experimentally from the di&#8208; to the pentahydrates (4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone&#8208;(H2O)n=2&#8211;5), including the 18O isotopologues for the di&#8208; and trihydrates. Interestingly, to accommodate water molecules effectively, the heavy atom skeleton of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone reshapes in every observed isomer and does not correspond to the stable conformer of the free monomer. All solvates initiate from the alcohol group (proton donor) but retain the carbonyl group as secondary binding point. The water scaffolds closely resemble those found in the pure water clusters, balancing between the capability of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone for steering the orientation and position of the water molecules and the ability of water to modulate the monomer's conformation. The present work thus provides an accurate molecular description on how torsionally flexible molecules dynamically adapt to water along progressing solvation.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Ortho/Ipso C&#8722;H Difunctionalizations of Arenes using Thianthrene as a Leaving Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the development of a &#8220;C&#8722;H thianthrenation/Catellani&#8221; strategy, the regioselective C&#8722;H difunctionalization of various non&#8208;prefunctionalized arenes was successfully achieved. Starting from thianthrenium salts and using a commercially available norbornene, this approach will further open the chemical space of late&#8208;stage functionalization.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective ortho/ipso C&#8722;H difunctionalizations of aromatic compounds were designed to afford polyfunctionalized arenes including challenging 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted ones (62&#8197;examples, up to 97&#8201;% yields). To ensure the excellent regioselectivity of the process while keeping high efficiency, an original strategy based on a &#8220;C&#8722;H thianthenation/Catellani&#8208;type reaction&#8221; sequence was developed starting from simple arenes. Non&#8208;prefunctionalized arenes were first regioselectively converted into the corresponding thianthrenium salts. Then, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, norbornene (NBE)&#8208;mediated process allowed the synthesis of ipso&#8208;olefinated/ortho&#8208;alkylated polyfunctionalized arenes using a thianthrene as a leaving group (revisited Catellani reaction). Pleasingly, using a commercially available norbornene (NBE) and a unique catalytic system, synthetic challenges known for the Catellani reaction with aryl iodides were smoothly and successfully tackled with the &#8220;thianthrenium&#8221; approach. The protocol was robust (gram&#8208;scale reaction) and was widely applied to the two&#8208;fold functionalization of various arenes including bio&#8208;active compounds.

&lt;p&gt;Through the development of a &#8220;C&#8722;H thianthrenation/Catellani&#8221; strategy, the regioselective C&#8722;H difunctionalization of various non-prefunctionalized arenes was successfully achieved. Starting from thianthrenium salts and using a commercially available norbornene, this approach will further open the chemical space of late-stage functionalization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Site-selective &lt;i&gt;ortho/ipso&lt;/i&gt; C&#8722;H difunctionalizations of aromatic compounds were designed to afford polyfunctionalized arenes including challenging 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted ones (62&#8197;examples, up to 97&#8201;% yields). To ensure the excellent regioselectivity of the process while keeping high efficiency, an original strategy based on a &#8220;C&#8722;H thianthenation/Catellani-type reaction&#8221; sequence was developed starting from simple arenes. Non-prefunctionalized arenes were first regioselectively converted into the corresponding thianthrenium salts. Then, a palladium-catalyzed, norbornene (NBE)-mediated process allowed the synthesis of &lt;i&gt;ipso&lt;/i&gt;-olefinated/&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-alkylated polyfunctionalized arenes using a thianthrene as a leaving group (revisited Catellani reaction). Pleasingly, using a commercially available norbornene (NBE) and a unique catalytic system, synthetic challenges known for the Catellani reaction with aryl iodides were smoothly and successfully tackled with the &#8220;thianthrenium&#8221; approach. The protocol was robust (gram-scale reaction) and was widely applied to the two-fold functionalization of various arenes including bio-active compounds. Moreover, a panel of olefins and alkyl halides as coupling partners was suitable. Pleasingly, the &#8220;thianthrenium&#8221; strategy was successfully further applied to the incorporation of other groups at the &lt;i&gt;ipso&lt;/i&gt; (CN/alkyl/H, aryl) and &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; (alkyl, aryl, amine, thiol) positions, showcasing the generality of the process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimizing Molecular Packing via Steric Hindrance for Reducing Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

In the study, three new acceptors BTP&#8208;Biso, BTP&#8208;Bme and BTP&#8208;B, with sterically structured triisopropylbenzene, trimethylbenzene and benzene as side chains, are reported. Due to the intense spatial hindrance effect, the intramolecular rotation is obviously restricted, and the intermolecular packing is substantially altered. Consequently, PB2&#8201;:&#8201;PBDB&#8208;TF&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;Bme&#8208;based ternary device achieves a remarkable PCE of 19.3&#8201;% with a notably low &#916;Enr of 0.19&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Innovative molecule design strategy holds promise for the development of next&#8208;generation acceptor materials for efficient organic solar cells with low non&#8208;radiative energy loss (&#916;Enr). In this study, we designed and prepared three novel acceptors, namely BTP&#8208;Biso, BTP&#8208;Bme and BTP&#8208;B, with sterically structured triisopropylbenzene, trimethylbenzene and benzene as side chains inserted into the shoulder of the central core. The progressively enlarged steric hindrance from BTP&#8208;B to BTP&#8208;Bme and BTP&#8208;Biso induces suppressed intramolecular rotation and altered the molecule packing mode in their aggregation states, leading to significant changes in absorption spectra and energy levels. By regulating the intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, BTP&#8208;Bme possesses relatively reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination rate and extended exciton diffusion lengths. The binary device based on PB2&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;Bme exhibits an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.5&#8201;% with a low &#916;Enr of 0.19&#8197;eV. Furthermore, the ternary device comprising PB2&#8201;:&#8201;PBDB&#8208;TF&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;Bme achieves an outstanding PCE of 19.3&#8201;%. The molecule design strategy in this study proposed new perspectives for developing high&#8208;performance acceptors with low &#916;Enr in OSCs.

         <title>C(sp3)&#8722;H (N&#8208;Phenyltetrazole)thiolation as an Enabling Tool for Molecular Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (N&#8208;phenyltetrazole)thiolation of aliphatic and (hetero)benzylic C&#8722;H bonds allows access to N&#8208;phenyltetrazole thioethers which are elaborated in diverse fragment couplings for C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, or C&#8722;N construction. The reaction proceeds via radical&#8208;chain hydrogen atom transfer by the N&#8208;phenyltetrazolethiyl radical with substrate as limiting reagent in all cases.







Abstract
Methods enabling the broad diversification of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds from a common intermediate are especially valuable in chemical synthesis. Herein, we report a site&#8208;selective (N&#8208;phenyltetrazole)thiolation of aliphatic and (hetero)benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds using a commercially available disulfide to access N&#8208;phenyltetrazole thioethers. The thioether products are readily elaborated in diverse fragment couplings for C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, or C&#8722;N construction. The C&#8722;H functionalization proceeds via a radical&#8208;chain pathway involving hydrogen atom transfer by the electron&#8208;poor N&#8208;phenyltetrazolethiyl radical. Hexafluoroisopropanol was found to be essential to reactions involving aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H thiolation, with computational analysis consistent with dual hydrogen bonding of the N&#8208;phenyltetrazolethiyl radical imparting increased radical electrophilicity to facilitate the hydrogen atom transfer. Substrate is limiting reagent in all cases, and the reaction displays an exceptional functional group tolerance well suited to applications in late&#8208;stage diversification.

         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent syntheses of thiabicyclo[4.1.1]octanes (S&#8208;BCOs) and highly substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes have been achieved through a Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of bicyclobutanes (BCBs) and 3&#8208;benzylideneindoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione derivatives. Moreover, rapid access of S&#8208;BCOs, which were not readily accessible by known methods, has been realized through Zn(OTf)2&#8208;catalyzed uncommon [4&#960;+2&#963;] cycloadditions of BCBs.







Abstract
The exploration of the complex chemical diversity of bicyclo[n.1.1]alkanes and their use as benzene bioisosteres has garnered significant attention over the past two decades. Regiodivergent syntheses of thiabicyclo[4.1.1]octanes (S&#8208;BCOs) and highly substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) using a Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed formal cycloaddition of bicyclobutanes (BCBs) and 3&#8208;benzylideneindoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione derivatives have been established. The first hetero&#8208;(4+3) cycloaddition of BCBs, catalyzed by Zn(OTf)2, was achieved with a broad substrate scope under mild conditions. In contrast, the less electrophilic BCB ester undergoes a Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed [2&#960;+2&#963;] reaction with 1,1,2&#8208;trisubstituted alkenes, yielding BCHs with a spirocyclic quaternary carbon center. Control experiments and preliminary theoretical calculations suggest that the diastereoselective [2&#960;+2&#963;] product formation may involve a concerted cycloaddition between a zwitterionic intermediate and E&#8208;1,1,2&#8208;trisubstituted alkenes. Additionally, the hetero&#8208;(4+3) cycloaddition may involve a concerted nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening mechanism.

Like a hand in glove, a glove that fits many different sizes, is how TFM, a new crystallization chaperone for liquid molecules, packs when it crystallizes as a solvate, leading to X&#8208;ray diffraction&#8208;based crystal structures that cannot be obtained otherwise. This and a new temperature jump crystallization protocol is presented in the Research Article (e202402976) by Clemens Richert and colleagues. The cover graphic shows the analytes and the chaperone, together with the crystal lattice of the squalene solvate.

         <title>Controlling On&#8208;Surface Photoactivity: The Impact of &#960;&#8208;Conjugation in Anhydride&#8208;Functionalized Molecules on a Semiconductor Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the on&#8208;surface reaction of anhydride&#8208;functionalized molecules as precursors on a SnSe surface investigated by SPM and XPS techniques. Quantum chemical calculations demonstrate how their photoactivity can be controlled by modulating the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the molecular core.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis has become a prominent method for growing low&#8208;dimensional carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials on metal surfaces. However, the necessity of decoupling organic nanostructures from metal substrates to exploit their properties requires either transfer methods or new strategies to perform reactions directly on inert surfaces. The use of on&#8208;surface light&#8208;induced reactions directly on semiconductor/insulating surfaces represents an alternative approach to address these challenges. Here, exploring the photochemical activity of different organic molecules on a SnSe semiconductor surface under ultra&#8208;high vacuum, we present a novel on&#8208;surface light&#8208;induced reaction. The selective photodissociation of the anhydride group is observed, releasing CO and CO2. Moreover, we rationalize the relationship between the photochemical activity and the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the molecular core. The different experimental behaviour of two model anhydrides was elucidated by theoretical calculations, showing how the molecular structure influences the distribution of the excited states. Our findings open new pathways for on&#8208;surface synthesis directly on technologically relevant substrates.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic electron transfer commonly depends on scarce and precious transition metals like Ru and Ir due to their exceptional photophysical properties. In their Research Article (e202405780), Patrick Nuernberger, Regina de&#8197;Vivie&#8208;Riedle, Robert Wolf et&#8197;al. present an alternative approach using readily available complexes with earth&#8208;abundant 3d metals. Despite their short excited&#8208;state lifetimes, photocatalysis is made possible by dispersive preassembly in the ground state, opening exciting opportunities for new catalytic applications in organic synthesis.

         <title>Reaction, Recognition, Relay: Anhydride Hydrolysis Reported by Conformationally Responsive Fluorinated Foldamers in Micelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ hydrolysis of an insoluble anhydride produces chiral carboxylate in the aqueous phase, a signal that is recognized by artificial zinc(II)&#8208;capped membrane receptors embedded in micelles. These receptors relay the effect of this binding event along their length to produce a distinct 19F&#8197;NMR output, &#916;&#948;, from inside the hydrophobic region of the micelles.







Abstract
Natural membrane receptors are proteins that can report on changes in the concentration of external chemical messengers. Messenger binding to a receptor produces conformational changes that are relayed through the membrane into the cell; this information allows cells to adapt to changes in their environment. Artificial membrane receptors (R)&#8208;1 and (S)&#8208;1 are helical &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) foldamers that replicate key parts of this information relay. Solution&#8208;phase 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy of zinc(II)&#8208;capped receptor 1, either in organic solvent or in membrane&#8208;mimetic micelles, showed messenger binding produced an enrichment of either left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed screw&#8208;sense; the chirality of the bound messenger was relayed to the other receptor terminus. Furthermore, in situ production of a chemical messenger in the external aqueous environment could be detected in real&#8208;time by a racemic mixture of receptor 1 in micelles. The hydrolysis of insoluble anhydrides produced carboxylate in the aqueous phase, which bound to the receptors and gave a distinct 19F&#8197;NMR output from inside the hydrophobic region of the micelles.

         <title>Oxidative Addition of E&#8722;H (E=C, N) Bonds to Transient Uranium(II) Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Examples of intermolecular oxidative addition involving C&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds to a transient U(II) center have been achieved. This study not only broadens the scope of two&#8208;electron oxidative additions for low&#8208;valent uranium centers from C&#8722;H to N&#8722;H bonds but also indicates that intermolecular two&#8208;electron oxidative additions are possible with actinide elements.







Abstract
Two&#8208;electron oxidative addition is one of the most important elementary reactions for d&#8208;block transition metals but it is uncommon for f&#8208;block elements. Here, we report the first examples of intermolecular oxidative addition of E&#8722;H (E=C, N) bonds to uranium(II) centers. The transient U(II) species was formed in&#8208;situ by reducing a heterometallic cluster featuring U(IV)&#8208;Pd(0) bonds with potassium&#8208;graphite (KC8). Oxidative addition of C&#8722;H or N&#8722;H bonds to the U(II) centers was observed when this transient U(II) species was treated with benzene, carbazole or 1&#8208;adamantylamine, respectively. The U(II) centers could also react with tetracene, biphenylene or N2O, leading to the formation of arene reduced U(IV) products and uranyl(VI) species via two&#8208; or four&#8208;electron processes. This study demonstrates that the intermolecular two&#8208;electron oxidative addition reactions are viable for actinide elements.

         <title>Platelet&#8208;Drug Conjugates Engineered via One&#8208;step Fusion Approach for Metastatic and Postoperative Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of cell&#8208;based drug delivery systems for cancer therapy has gained growing attention. Approaches to engineering therapeutic cells with multidrug loading in an effective, safe, and precise manner while preserving their inherent biological properties remain of great interest. Here, we report a strategy to simultaneously load multiple drugs in platelets in a one&#8208;step fusion process. We demonstrate doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;encapsulated liposomes conjugated with interleukin&#8208;15 (IL&#8208;15) could fuse with platelets to achieve both cytoplasmic drug loading and surface cytokine modification with a loading efficiency of over 70% within minutes. Due to their inherent targeting ability to metastatic cancers and postoperative bleeding sites, the engineered platelets demonstrated a synergistic therapeutic effect to suppress lung metastasis and postoperative recurrence in mouse B16F10 melanoma tumor models.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The exploration of cell-based drug delivery systems for cancer therapy has gained growing attention. Approaches to engineering therapeutic cells with multidrug loading in an effective, safe, and precise manner while preserving their inherent biological properties remain of great interest. Here, we report a strategy to simultaneously load multiple drugs in platelets in a one-step fusion process. We demonstrate doxorubicin (DOX)-encapsulated liposomes conjugated with interleukin-15 (IL-15) could fuse with platelets to achieve both cytoplasmic drug loading and surface cytokine modification with a loading efficiency of over 70% within minutes. Due to their inherent targeting ability to metastatic cancers and postoperative bleeding sites, the engineered platelets demonstrated a synergistic therapeutic effect to suppress lung metastasis and postoperative recurrence in mouse B16F10 melanoma tumor models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Glutathione Assembly Supported on ZIF&#8208;8 as Robust and Efficient Catalyst for Mild CO2 Conversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Cu&#8208;glutathione (GSH) redox system, essential in biology, is designed here as a supramacromolecular assembly in which the tetrahedral 18e Cu(I) center loses a thiol ligand upon adsorption onto ZIF&#8208;8, as shown by EXAFS and DFT calculation, to generate a very robust 16e planar trigonal single&#8208;atom Cu(I) catalyst. Synergy between Cu(I) and ZIF&#8208;8, revealed by catalytic experiments and DFT, affords CO2 conversion into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals with a wide scope of substrates by reaction with terminal alkynes or propargyl amines in excellent yields under mild conditions and reuse at least 10 times without significant decrease in catalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Photorefinery of Biomass and Plastics to Renewable Chemicals using Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic conversion of biomass and plastic waste provides&#160;opportunities for sustainable fuel and chemical production. Heterogeneous photocatalysts, typically composed of semiconductors with distinctive redox properties in their conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), facilitate both the oxidative and reductive valorization of organic feedstocks. This article&#160;provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the photorefinery of biomass and plastics from the perspective of the redox properties of photocatalysts. We explore the roles of the VB and CB in enhancing the value&#8208;added conversion of biomass and plastics&#160;via various pathways. Our aim is to bridge the gap between photocatalytic mechanisms and renewable carbon feedstock&#160;valorization, inspiring further development in photocatalytic refinery of biomass and plastics.</dc:description>

         <title>Aerodynamically Levitated Droplets as Small&#8208;scale Reactors and Liquid Microprinters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A thin liquid film spread over the inner surface of a rapidly rotating vial creates an&#160;aerodynamic cushion on which one or multiple droplets of various liquids can levitate stably for days or even weeks. These levitating droplets can serve as wall&#8208;less (&#8220;airware&#8221;) chemical reactors that can be merged without touching &#8211; by remote impulses &#8211; to initiate reactions or sequences of reactions at scales down to hundreds of nanomoles. Moreover, under external electric fields, the droplets can act as the world&#8217;s smallest chemical printers, shedding regular trains of pL or even fL microdrops. In one modality, the levitating droplets operate as completely wirelesss aliquoting/titrating systems delivering pg quantities of reagents into the liquid in the rotating vial; in another modality, they print microdroplet arrays onto target surfaces. The &#8220;airware&#8221;, levitated reactors are inexpensive to set up, remarkably stable to external disturbances and, for printing applications, require operating voltages much lower than in electrospray, electrowetting, or ink jet systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrosynthesis of an Improbable Directly Bonded Phosphorene&#8208;Fullerene Heterodimensional Hybrid toward Boosted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorene and fullerene are representative two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) nanomaterials respectively, constructing their heterodimensional hybrid not only complements their physiochemical properties but also extends their applications via synergistic interactions. This is however challenging because of their diversities in dimension and chemical reactivity, and theoretical studies predicted that it is improbable to directly bond C60 onto the surface of phosphorene due to their strong repulsion. Here, we develop a facile electrosynthesis method to synthesize the first phosphorene&#8208;fullerene hybrid featuring fullerene surface bonding via P&#8208;C bonds. Few&#8208;layer black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) obtained from electrochemical exfoliation react with C602&#8208; dianion prepared by electroreduction of C60, fulfilling formation of the &#8220;improbable&#8221; phosphorene&#8208;fullerene hybrid (BPNS&#8208;s&#8208;C60). Theoretical results reveal that the energy barrier for formation of [BPNS&#8208;s&#8208;C60]2&#8208; intermediate is significantly decreased by 1.88 eV, followed by an oxidization reaction to generate neutral BPNS&#8208;s&#8208;C60 hybrid. Surface bonding of C60 molecules not only improves significantly the ambient stability of BPNSs, but also boosts dramatically the visible light and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates, reaching 1466 and 1039 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 respectively, which are both the highest values among all reported BP&#8208;based metal&#8208;free photocatalysts.</dc:description>

Both compounds were confirmed to be triradicals and to possess intramolecular antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between spins, displaying a spin&#8208;frustrated doublet ground state with doublet&#8208;quartet energy gaps of &#8722;0.14 kcal/mol for 1 and &#8722;0.06 kcal/mol for 2. Despite their open&#8208;shell character, they were sufficiently stable to be handled under ambient conditions on a timescale of days. Both compounds could be reversibly reduced to mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trianions and oxidized to 1+ and 22+, with strong NIR absorptions (1800 to over 3200 nm) observed for all open&#8208;shell ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion Exchange&#8208;mediated 3D Cross&#8208;linked ZIF&#8208;L Superstructure for Flexible Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered as a promising candidate for advancing energy storage owing to their intrinsic multi&#8208;channel architecture, high theoretical capacity, and precise adjustability. However, the low conductivity and poor structural stability lead to unsatisfactory rate and cycling performance, greatly hindering their practical application. Herein, we propose a sea urchin&#8208;like Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L superstructure using molecular template to induce self&#8208;assembly followed by ion exchange method, which shows improved conductivity, successive channels, and high stability. The ion exchange can gradually etch the superstructure, leading to the reconstruction of Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) cross&#8208;linked ultrathin porous nanosheets. Moreover, the precise control of Co to Ni ratios can construct effective micro&#8208;electric field and synergistically enhance the rapid transfer of electrons and electrolyte ions, improving the conductivity and stability of CoNi&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L. The Co6.53Ni&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L electrode exhibits a high specific capacity (602 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1) and long cycling stability (95.3% retention after 4,000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1). The Co6.53Ni&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L//AC asymmetric flexible supercapacitor employing gel electrolyte also exhibits excellent cycling stability (93.3% retention after 4000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1). This discovery provides valuable insights for electrode material selection and energy storage efficiency improvement.</dc:description>

         <title>Learning from Protein Engineering by Deconvolution of Multi&#8208;Mutational Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review analyzes a development in biochemistry, enzymology and biotechnology
that originally came as a surprise. As part of directed evolution of stereoselective
enzymes in organic chemistry, the concept of partial or complete deconvolution of
selective multi&#8208;mutational variants was established and refined during the past 15
years. Early deconvolution experiments of stereoselective variants led to the finding
that mutations can interact cooperatively or antagonistically with one another, not just
additively. Later, this phenomenon was shown to be general. Molecular dynamics (MD)
and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) computations were
performed in order to shed light on the origin of non&#8208;additivity at all stages of an
evolutionary upward climb. Data of complete deconvolution can be used to construct
unique multi&#8208;dimensional rugged fitness pathway landscapes, which provide more
mechanistic insight than traditional fitness landscapes. Along a related line,
biochemists have long tested the result of introducing two point mutations in an
enzyme for mechanistic reasons, followed by a comparison of the respective double
mutant in so&#8208;called double mutant cycles, which originally showed only additive effects,
but more recently also uncovered cooperative and antagonistic non&#8208;additive effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkene Isomerisation Catalysed by a Superbasic Sodium Amide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Typically catalysed by transition metals,&#160;alkene isomerisation is a powerful&#160;&#160;methodology for preparation of internal olefins.&#160;In contrast, the use of more earth abundant main group reagents is limited to activated substrates, requiring high temperatures and excess stoichiometric amounts. Opening a new portal for progressing this field, here we report applications of bulky sodium amide NaTMP (TMP = 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide) when partnered by tridentate Lewis donor PMDETA (N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine)&#160;in catalytic alkene isomerisation of terminal olefins under mild reaction conditions. An array of distinct olefins could successfully be isomerised, including unactivated olefins, allylamines and allylethers, showing the high activity of this partnership.&#160;In&#8208;depth mechanistic insights provided by X&#8208;ray crystallography, real&#8208;time&#160;nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)&#160;monitoring, and&#160;density functional theory (DFT)&#160;calculations have unveiled the crucial role of in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated TMP(H) in facilitating efficient isomerisation and the choice of alkali&#8208;metal. Additionally, theoretical studies shed light on the observed E/Z selectivity, particularly accounting for selective formation of Z&#8208;vinyl ethers.&#160;The versatility of our method is further demonstrated through isomerisation of unactivated cycloalkenes, which undergo hydrogen isotope exchange to produce deuterated compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamics of the Boundary Layer in Pulsed CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of CO2 poses a vast potential to contribute to a defossilized industry. Despite tremendous developments within the &#64257;eld, mass transport limitations, carbonate salt formation, and electrode degradation mechanisms still hamper the process performance. One promising approach to tweak CO2 electrolysis beyond today&#8217;s limitations is pulsed electrolysis with potential cycling between an operating and a regeneration mode. Here, we rigorously model the boundary layer at a silver electrode in pulsed operation to get profound insights into the dynamic reorganization of the electrode microenvironment. In our simulation, pulsed electrolysis leads to a significant improvement of up to six times higher CO current density and 20 times higher cathodic energy e&#64259;ciency when pulsing between &#8208;1.85 and &#8208;1.05&#160;V vs SHE compared to constant potential operation. We found that elevated reactant availability in pulsed electrolysis originates from alternating replenishment of CO2 by di&#64256;usion and not from pH&#8208;induced carbonate and bicarbonate conversion. Moreover, pulsed electrolysis substantially promotes carbonate removal from the electrode by up to 83&#160;% compared to constant potential operation, thus reducing the risk of salt formation. Therefore, this model lays the groundwork for an accurate simulation of the dynamic boundary layer modulation, which can provide insights into manifold electrochemical conversions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New photostable and bright supramolecular complexes based on cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) host and diketopyrrolopyrole (DPP) guest dyes having two positively charged 4&#8208;(trimethylammonio)phenyl groups were prepared; with spectra (H2O, abs. / emission max. 480 / 550 nm; e ~ 19 000, tfl &gt; 4 ns), strong binding with hosts (~560 nM Kd) and a linker affording fluorescence detection of bioconjugates with antibody and nanobody. Combination of protein&#8208;functionalized DPP dye&#160;with CB7 improves photostability and affords up to 12&#8208;fold emission gain. Two&#8208;color confocal and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy with 595 nm or 655 nm STED depletion lasers shows that the presence of CB7 not only leads to&#160;improved&#160;brightness and image quality, but also results&#160;in&#160;DPP becoming&#160;cell&#8208;permeable.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Anion Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Alkanethiolate&#8208;Protected PtAu12 Superatoms: Charging Energy in Vacuum vs Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charging behavior of molecular Au clusters protected by alkanethiolate (SCnH2n+1 = SCn) is, under electrochemical conditions, significantly affected by the penetration of solvent and electrolyte into the SCn layer. In this study, we estimated the charging energy EC(n) associated with [PtAu24(SCn)18]&#8211; + e &#8594; [PtAu24(SCn)18]2&#8211; (n = 4, 8, 12, and 16) in vacuum using mass&#8208;selected, gas&#8208;phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy of [PtAu24(SCn)18]z (z = &#8211;1 and &#8211;2). The EC(n) values of PtAu24(SCn)18 in vacuum are significantly larger than those in solution and decrease with n in contrast to the behavior reported for Au25(SCn)18 in solution. The effective relative permittivity (&#949;m*) of the SCn layer in vacuum is estimated to be 2.3&#8211;2.0 based on the double&#8208;concentric&#8208;capacitor model. Much smaller &#949;m* values in vacuum than those in solution are explained by the absence of solvent/electrolyte penetration into the monolayer. The gradual decrease of &#949;m* with n is ascribed to the appearance of an exposed surface region due to the bundle formation of long alkyl chains.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>It is still a great challenge to achieve high selectivity of ethanol in CO2 electroreduction reactions (CO2RR) because of the similar reduction potentials and lower energy barrier of possible other C2+ products. Here, we report a MOF&#8208;based supported low&#8208;nuclearity cluster catalysts (LNCCs), synthesized by electrochemical reduction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microporous Cu&#8208;based MOF, that achieves a single&#8208;product Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.5% at &#8722;1.0 &#8201;V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) corresponding to the effective current density is 8.66 mA cm&#8722;2. By investigating the relationship between the species of reduction products and the types of catalytic sites, it is confirmed that the multi&#8208;site synergism of Cu LNCCs can increase the C&#8722;C coupling effect, and thus achieve high FE of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculation and operando attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy further confirmed the reaction path and mechanism of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;EtOH.</dc:description>

         <title>Altering the CO2 electroreduction pathways towards C1 or C2+ products via engineering the strength of interfacial Cu&#8208;O bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalysts have established their unique capability for yielding wide value&#8208;added products from CO2. Herein, we demonstrate that the pathways of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) can be rationally altered toward C1 or C2+ products by simply optimizing the coordination of Cu with O&#8208;containing organic species (squarate (C4O4) and cyclohexanhexanone (C6O6)). It is revealed that the strength of Cu&#8208;O bonds can significantly affect the morphologies and electronic structures of derived Cu catalysts, resulting in the distinct behaviors during CO2RR. Specifically, the C6O6&#8208;Cu catalysts made up from organized nanodomains shows a dominant C1 pathway with a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 63.7% at &#8208;1.0 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). In comparison, the C4O4&#8208;Cu with an about perfect crystalline structure results in uniformly dispersed Cu&#8208;atoms, showing a notable FE of 65.8% for C2+ products with enhanced capability of C&#8208;C coupling. The latter system also shows stable operation over at least 10 h with a high current density of 205.1 mA cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;1.0 VRHE, i.e. is already at the boarder of practical relevance. This study sheds light on the rational design of Cu&#8208;based catalysts for directing the CO2RR reaction pathway.</dc:description>

Specifically, the C6O6-Cu catalysts made up from organized nanodomains shows a dominant C1 pathway with a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 63.7% at -1.0 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). In comparison, the C4O4-Cu with an about perfect crystalline structure results in uniformly dispersed Cu-atoms, showing a notable FE of 65.8% for C2+ products with enhanced capability of C-C coupling. The latter system also shows stable operation over at least 10 h with a high current density of 205.1 mA cm-2 at -1.0 VRHE, i.e. is already at the boarder of practical relevance.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A reaction&#8208;based optical relay sensing strategy that enables accurate determination of the concentration and enantiomeric ratio (er) of challenging chiral alcohols exhibiting stereocenters at the &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208; or even &#948;&#8208;position or hard&#8208;to&#8208;detect cryptochirality arising from H/D substitution is described. This unmatched application scope is achieved with a conceptually new sensing approach by which the alcohol moiety is replaced with an optimized achiral sulfonamide chromophore to minimize the distance between the covalently attached chiroptical reporter unit and the stereogenic center in the substrate. The result is a remarkably strong, red&#8208;shifted CD induction that increases linearly with the sample er. The CD sensing part of the tandem assay is seamlessly coupled to a redox reaction with a quinone molecule to generate a characteristic UV response that is independent of the enantiopurity of the alcohol and thus allows determination of the total analyte concentration. The robustness and utility of the CD/UV relay are further verified by chromatography&#8208;free asymmetric reaction analysis with small aliquots of crude product mixtures, paving the way toward high&#8208;throughput chiral compound screening workflows which is a highly sought&#8208;after goal in the pharmaceutical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Mapping of Protein Aggregates in Live Cells Modeling Huntington&#8217;s Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While protein aggregation is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, acquiring structural information on protein aggregates inside live cells remains challenging. Traditional microscopy does not provide structural information on protein systems. Routinely used fluorescent protein tags, such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), might perturb native structures. Here, we report a counter&#8208;propagating mid&#8208;infrared photothermal imaging approach enabling mapping of secondary structure of protein aggregates in live cells modeling Huntington&#8217;s disease. By comparing mid&#8208;infrared photothermal spectra of label&#8208;free and GFP&#8208;tagged huntingtin inclusions, we demonstrate that GFP fusions indeed perturb the secondary structure of aggregates. By implementing spectra with small spatial step for dissecting spectral features within sub&#8208;micrometer distances, we reveal that huntingtin inclusions partition into a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich core and a &#593;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich shell. We further demonstrate that this structural partition exists only in cells with the [RNQ+] prion state, while [rnq&#8208;] cells only carry smaller &#946;&#8208;rich non&#8208;toxic aggregates. Collectively, our methodology has the potential to unveil detailed structural information on protein assemblies in live cells, enabling high&#8208;throughput structural screenings of macromolecular assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Strategy Based&#160;on Hetero&#8208;Charge Coupling Effect for Constructing Single&#8208;Atom Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts have emerged as cutting&#8208;edge hotspots in the field of material science owing to their excellent catalytic performance brought about by well&#8208;defined metal single&#8208;atom sites&#160;(M SASs). Herein, we report a novel synthesis strategy based on the hetero&#8208;charge coupling effect (HCCE)&#160;to prepare M SASs&#160;loaded on N and S co&#8208;doped porous carbon (M1/NSC). The proposed strategy was widely applied to prepare 17&#160;types of M1/NSC&#160;composed of single or multi&#8208;metal with the integrated regulation of the coordination environment and electronic structure, exhibiting&#160;good universality and flexible adjustability. Furthermore, this strategy provided a low&#8208;cost method of efficiently synthesizing&#160;M1/NSC with&#160;high yields, that can produce more than 50 g&#160;catalyst at one time, which is key to large&#8208;scale production. Among various as&#8208;prepared unary M1/NSC catalysts, Fe1/NSC delivered excellent performance for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction&#160;to NH3&#160;with high&#160;NH3&#160;Faradaic efficiency of 86.6% and high NH3&#160;yield rate of 1.50 mg h&#8722;1&#160;mgcat.&#8722;1&#160;at &#8722;0.6 V vs.&#160;RHE. Even using Fe1/NSC as a cathode in a Zn&#8722;nitrate battery, it exhibited a&#160;high open circuit voltage of 1.756 V&#160;and high energy density of 4.42 mW cm&#8722;2&#160;with good cycling stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Like Catalysis of Vinyl Copolymer Carrying Boron Directly Connected to Backbone: Catalytic Esterification through Cooperation of Boron with Neighboring Carboxylic Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alternating&#8208;rich copolymer of vinylboronic acid pinacol ester (VBpin) and maleic anhydride (MAH) was found to catalyze direct dehydrative esterification of carboxylic acid and alcohol. The key to the catalytic function is the activation of the MAH unit by the neighboring Lewis acidic boron directly connected to the backbone through the formation of five&#8208;membered ring. The effects of the side&#8208;chain cooperation were clarified through comparisons with the polymers having similar structures and a conventional titanium catalyst as well as the analyses of reactions with carboxylic acid or alcohol. The catalytic activity was enhanced as the molecular weight was higher, which is owing to the structural feature that boron is directly attached to the backbone. The cooperative catalysis is of interest because of its conceptual similarity with enzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering and Integrating Functionalized Side Chains for High Ion&#8208;Conductive Elastic Ternary Copolymer Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Safe Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A critical challenge in solid polymer lithium batteries is developing a polymer matrix that can harmonize ionic transportation, electrochemical stability, and mechanical durability. We introduce a novel polymer matrix design by deciphering the structure&#8208;function relationships of polymer side chains. Leveraging the molecular orbital&#8208;polarity&#8208;spatial freedom design strategy, a high ion&#8208;conductive hyperelastic ternary copolymer electrolyte (CPE) is synthesized, incorporating three functionalized side chains of poly&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;Trifluoroethyl acrylate (PTFEA), poly(vinylene carbonate) (PVC), and polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA). It is revealed that fluorine&#8208;rich side chain (PTFEA) contributes to improved stability and interfacial compatibility; the highly polar side chain (PVC) facilitates the efficient dissociation and migration of ions; the flexible side chain (PEGMEA) with high spatial freedom promotes segmental motion and interchain ion exchanges. The resulting CPE demonstrates an ionic conductivity of 2.19 &#215; 10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1 (30 &#176;C), oxidation resistance voltage of 4.97 V, excellent elasticity (2700%), and non&#8208;flammability. The outer elastic CPE and the inner organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid SEI buffer intense volume fluctuation and enable uniform Li+ deposition. As a result, symmetric Li cells realize a high CCD of 2.55 mA cm&#8208;2 and the CPE&#8208;based Li||NCM811 full cell exhibits a high&#8208;capacity retention (~90%, 0.5 C) after 200 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>A Unique Wide&#8208;Spacing Fence&#8208;Type Superstructure for Robust High&#8208;Voltage O3&#8208;Type Sodium Layered Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancing the energy density of layered oxide cathode materials is of great significance for realizing high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries and promoting their commercial application. Lattice oxygen redox at high voltage usually enables a high capacity and energy density. But the structural degradation, severe voltage decay, and the resultant poor cycling performance caused by irreversible oxygen release seriously restrict the practical application. Herein we introduce a novel fence&#8208;type superstructure (2a &#215; 3a type supercell) into O3&#8208;type layered cathode material Na0.9Li0.1Ni0.3Mn0.3Ti0.3O2 and achieve a stable cycling performance at a high voltage of 4.4 V. The fence&#8208;type superstructure effectively inhibits the formation of the vacancy clusters resulting from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Li migration and in&#8208;plane transition metal migration at high voltage due to the wide d&#8208;spacing, thereby significantly reducing the irreversible release of lattice oxygen and greatly stabilizing the crystal structure. The cathode exhibits a high energy density of 545 Wh kg&#8722;1, a high rate capability (112.8 mAh g&#8208;1 at 5C) and a high cycling stability (85.8%@200 cycles with a high initial capacity of 148.6 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1C) accompanied by negligible voltage attenuation (98.5%@200 cycles). This strategy provides a distinct spacing effect of superstructure to design stable high&#8208;voltage layered cathode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning Algorithm Guides Catalyst Choices for Magnesium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;chemical literature encompasses large numbers of catalysts and reactions they can effect. Many of these examples are published merely to document the catalysts&#8217; scope but do not necessarily guarantee that a given catalyst is &#8220;optimal&#8221; &#8211; in terms of yield or enantiomeric excess &#8211; for a particular reaction. This paper describes a Machine Learning model that aims to improve such catalyst&#8208;reaction assignments based on the carefully curated literature data. As we show here for the case of asymmetric magnesium catalysis, this model achieves relatively high accuracy and offers out of&#8208;the&#8208;box predictions successfully validated by experiment, e.g., in synthetically demanding asymmetric reductions or Michael additions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral biaryl &#948;&#8208;amino acids possess significantly different conformational properties and chiral environment from centrally chiral amino acids, therefore, have drawn considerable attention in the fields of synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Herein, a novel chiral phenanthroline&#8208;potassium catalyst has been developed by constructing a well&#8208;organized axially chiral ligand composed of one 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline unit and two axially chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) units. In the presence of this catalyst, good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield, 98:2 er) have been achieved in the ring&#8208;opening alcoholytic dynamic kinetic resolution of a variety of biaryl lactams, thereby providing an efficient protocol for catalytic asymmetric synthesis of unnatural axially chiral biaryl &#948;&#8208;amino acid derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Organic Polymers for Efficient and Selective SO2 Capture from CO2&#8208;rich Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capture of a low concentration SO2 is of utmost importance as it is responsible for many health and environmental issues. Herein we unveiled two porous organic polymers encompassing a high content of imidazole pockets to interact preferentially with SO2 vs CO2 which can remove trace amount of SO2 from CO2&#8208;containing streams with almost infinite selectivity and high capacity.







Abstract
The quest for effective technologies to reduce SO2 pollution is crucial due to its adverse effects on the environment and human health. Markedly, removing a ppm level of SO2 from CO2&#8208;containing waste gas is a persistent challenge, and current technologies suffer from low SO2/CO2 selectivity and energy&#8208;intensive regeneration processes. Here using the molecular building blocks approach and theoretical calculation, we constructed two porous organic polymers (POPs) encompassing pocket&#8208;like structures with exposed imidazole groups, promoting preferential interactions with SO2 from CO2&#8208;containing streams. Markedly, the evaluated POPs offer outstanding SO2/CO2 selectivity, high SO2 capacity, and an easy regeneration process, making it one of the best materials for SO2 capture. To gain better structural insights into the notable SO2 selectivity of the POPs, we used dynamic nuclear polarization NMR spectroscopy (DNP) and molecular modelling to probe the interactions between SO2 and POP adsorbents. The newly developed materials are poised to offer an energy&#8208;efficient and environment&#8208;friendly SO2 separation process while we are obliged to use fossil fuels for our energy needs.

         <title>Small Molecule&#8208;Inducible and Photoactivatable Cellular RNA N1&#8208;Methyladenosine Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study combines the CRISPR/dCas13b and chemical induced proximity (CIP) techniques to develop a small molecule&#8208;induced photo&#8208;controllable m1A demethylation editing tool (termed AI&#8208;dm1A) as well as an m1A methylation editing tool (termed AI&#8208;m1A). These m1A editing tools are able to regulate the biological function of targeted RNAs by modulating m1A modifications, which in turn influences cell functions.







Abstract
N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) modification is one of the most prevalent epigenetic modifications on RNA. Given the vital role of m1A modification in RNA processing such as splicing, stability and translation, developing a precise and controllable m1A editing tool is pivotal for in&#8208;depth investigating the biological functions of m1A. In this study, we developed an abscisic acid (ABA)&#8208;inducible and reversible m1A demethylation tool (termed AI&#8208;dm1A), which targets specific transcripts by combining the chemical proximity&#8208;induction techniques with the CRISPR/dCas13b system and ALKBH3. We successfully employed AI&#8208;dm1A to selectively demethylate the m1A modifications at A8422 of MALAT1 RNA, and this demethylation process could be reversed by removing ABA. Furthermore, we validated its demethylation function on various types of cellular RNAs including mRNA, rRNA and lncRNA. Additionally, we used AI&#8208;dm1A to specifically demethylate m1A on ATP5D mRNA, which promoted ATP5D expression and enhanced the glycolysis activity of tumor cells. Conversely, by replacing the demethylase ALKBH3 with methyltransferase TRMT61A, we also developed a controllable m1A methylation tool, namely AI&#8208;m1A. Finally, we caged ABA by 4,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl (DMNB) to achieve light&#8208;inducible m1A methylation or demethylation on specific transcripts. Collectively, our m1A editing tool enables us to flexibly study how m1A modifications on specific transcript influence biological functions and phenotypes.

&lt;p&gt;N1-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A) modification is one of the most prevalent epigenetic modifications on RNA. Given the vital role of m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A modification in RNA processing such as splicing, stability and translation, developing a precise and controllable m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A editing tool is pivotal for in-depth investigating the biological functions of m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A. In this study, we developed an abscisic acid (ABA)-inducible and reversible m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A demethylation tool (termed AI-dm&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A), which targets specific transcripts by combining the chemical proximity-induction techniques with the CRISPR/dCas13b system and ALKBH3. We successfully employed AI-dm&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A to selectively demethylate the m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A modifications at A8422 of MALAT1 RNA, and this demethylation process could be reversed by removing ABA. Furthermore, we validated its demethylation function on various types of cellular RNAs including mRNA, rRNA and lncRNA. Additionally, we used AI-dm&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A to specifically demethylate m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A on ATP5D mRNA, which promoted ATP5D expression and enhanced the glycolysis activity of tumor cells. Conversely, by replacing the demethylase ALKBH3 with methyltransferase TRMT61A, we also developed a controllable m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation tool, namely AI-m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A. Finally, we caged ABA by 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl (DMNB) to achieve light-inducible m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation or demethylation on specific transcripts. Collectively, our m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A editing tool enables us to flexibly study how m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A modifications on specific transcript influence biological functions and phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large Libraries of Structurally Diverse Macrocycles Suitable for Membrane Permeation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles are promising for drug development due to their good binding properties and the potential to cross membranes. A synthetic strategy and chemical building blocks are developed to produce and screen thousands of small, structurally highly diverse peptidic macrocycles. HTS identifies potent thrombin inhibitors with good membrane permeability. The strategy may be broadly applied in the development of membrane permeable therapeutics.







Abstract
Macrocycles offer an attractive format for drug development due to their good binding properties and potential to cross cell membranes. To efficiently identify macrocyclic ligands for new targets, methods for the synthesis and screening of large combinatorial libraries of small cyclic peptides were developed, many of them using thiol groups for efficient peptide macrocyclization. However, a weakness of these libraries is that invariant thiol&#8208;containing building blocks such as cysteine are used, resulting in a region that does not contribute to library diversity but increases molecule size. Herein, we synthesized a series of structurally diverse thiol&#8208;containing elements and used them for the combinatorial synthesis of a 2,688&#8208;member library of small, structurally diverse peptidic macrocycles with unprecedented skeletal complexity. We then used this library to discover potent thrombin and plasma kallikrein inhibitors, some also demonstrating favorable membrane permeability. X&#8208;ray structure analysis of macrocycle&#8208;target complexes showed that the size and shape of the newly developed thiol elements are key for binding. The strategy and library format presented in this work significantly enhance structural diversity by allowing combinatorial modifications to a previously invariant region of peptide macrocycles, which may be broadly applied in the development of membrane permeable therapeutics.

Constructing Ni&#8208;doped cubic ZrO2 supported intermetallic L10&#8722;PtNi NPs via regulating RMSI between Pt and supports as high&#8208;performing ORR catalysts for PEMFCs







Abstract
Developing efficient and anti&#8208;corrosive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is of great importance for the applications of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Herein, we report a novel approach to prepare metal oxides supported intermetallic Pt alloy nanoparticles (NPs) via the reactive metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI) as ORR catalysts, using Ni&#8208;doped cubic ZrO2 (Ni/ZrO2) supported L10&#8722;PtNi NPs as a proof of concept. Benefiting from the Ni migration during RMSI, the oxygen vacancy concentrations in the support are increased, leading to an electron enrichment of Pt. The optimal L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2&#8722;RMSI catalyst achieves remarkably low mass activity (MA) loss (17.8&#8201;%) after 400,000 accelerated durability test cycles in a half&#8208;cell and exceptional PEMFC performance (MA=0.76&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V, peak power density=1.52/0.92&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8722;O2/&#8722;air, and 18.4&#8201;% MA decay after 30,000&#8197;cycles), representing the best reported Pt&#8208;based ORR catalysts without carbon supports. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2&#8722;RMSI requires a lower energetic barrier for ORR than L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2 (direct loading), which is ascribed to a decreased Bader charge transfer between Pt and *OH, and the improved stability of L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2&#8722;RMSI compared to L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;C can be contributed to the increased adhesion energy and Ni vacancy formation energy within the PtNi alloy.

         <title>Assembly&#8208;Induced Dynamic Structural Color in a Host&#8208;Guest System for Time&#8208;Dependent Anticounterfeiting and Double&#8208;Lock Encryption</title>

We report a dynamic structural color induced by the difference in the time required for accomplishing the assembly process. This distinctive result opens a door for countless applications in time&#8208;dependent anticounterfeiting and double&#8208;lock encryption.







Abstract
Manipulation of periodic micro/nanostructures in polymer film is of great importance for academics and industrial applications in anticounterfeiting. However, with the increasing demand on information security, materials with time&#8208;dependent features are urgently required, especially the material where the same information can appear more than once on the time scale. Here, one concise strategy to realize time&#8208;dependent anticounterfeiting and &#8220;double&#8208;lock&#8221; information encryption based on a host&#8208;guest system is proposed, with one photoresponsive azopolymer as the host and one liquid&#8208;crystalline molecule as the guest. The system exhibits a tunable mass transport in pre&#8208;designed periodic micro/nanostructures by tailoring the process of cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans recovery of azo groups and assembly of mesogenic trans&#8208;isomers, resulting in a dynamic structural color in film. Taking advantage of this extraordinary feature, time&#8208;dependent dynamic anticounterfeiting has been achieved. More importantly, the time of each state's appearance in the whole process can be modulated by changing the host&#8208;guest ratio. Combining the manipulatable process of mass transport with the unique decoding method, the stored information in film can be decrypted correctly. This work provides an unprecedented dynamic approach for advanced anticounterfeiting technology with a higher level of security and high&#8208;end applications in information encryption.

         <title>Detection of Sulfoquinovosidase Activity in Cell Lysates Using Activity&#8208;Based Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of activity&#8208;based probes targeting the active site nucleophile of glycoside hydrolase family&#8197;31 sulfoquinovosidases is described. The probes are shown to bind covalently by structural biology, mass spectrometry and Cy5 in&#8208;gel fluorescence, are selective for sulfoquinovosidases in whole bacterial cell lysates, and are used to monitor active levels of enzyme over time.







Abstract
The sulfolipid sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG), produced by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, constitutes a major sulfur reserve in the biosphere. Microbial breakdown of SQDG is critical for the biological utilization of its sulfur. This commences through release of the parent sugar, sulfoquinovose (SQ), catalyzed by sulfoquinovosidases (SQases). These vanguard enzymes are encoded in gene clusters that code for diverse SQ catabolic pathways. To identify, visualize and isolate glycoside hydrolase CAZY&#8208;family&#8197;31 (GH31) SQases in complex biological environments, we introduce SQ cyclophellitol&#8208;aziridine activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs). These ABPs label the active site nucleophile of this enzyme family, consistent with specific recognition of the SQ cyclophellitol&#8208;aziridine in the active site, as evidenced in the 3D structure of Bacillus megaterium SQase. A fluorescent Cy5&#8208;probe enables visualization of SQases in crude cell lysates from bacteria harbouring different SQ breakdown pathways, whilst a biotin&#8208;probe enables SQase capture and identification by proteomics. The Cy5&#8208;probe facilitates monitoring of active SQase levels during different stages of bacterial growth which show great contrast to more traditional mRNA analysis obtained by RT&#8208;qPCR. Given the importance of SQases in global sulfur cycling and in human microbiota, these SQase ABPs provide a new tool with which to study SQase occurrence, activity and stability.

&lt;p&gt;The sulfolipid sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG), produced by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, constitutes a major sulfur reserve in the biosphere. Microbial breakdown of SQDG is critical for the biological utilization of its sulfur. This commences through release of the parent sugar, sulfoquinovose (SQ), catalyzed by sulfoquinovosidases (SQases). These vanguard enzymes are encoded in gene clusters that code for diverse SQ catabolic pathways. To identify, visualize and isolate glycoside hydrolase CAZY-family&#8197;31 (GH31) SQases in complex biological environments, we introduce SQ cyclophellitol-aziridine activity-based probes (ABPs). These ABPs label the active site nucleophile of this enzyme family, consistent with specific recognition of the SQ cyclophellitol-aziridine in the active site, as evidenced in the 3D structure of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus megaterium&lt;/i&gt; SQase. A fluorescent Cy5-probe enables visualization of SQases in crude cell lysates from bacteria harbouring different SQ breakdown pathways, whilst a biotin-probe enables SQase capture and identification by proteomics. The Cy5-probe facilitates monitoring of active SQase levels during different stages of bacterial growth which show great contrast to more traditional mRNA analysis obtained by RT-qPCR. Given the importance of SQases in global sulfur cycling and in human microbiota, these SQase ABPs provide a new tool with which to study SQase occurrence, activity and stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An All&#8208;Rounder for NIR&#8208;II Phototheranostics: Well&#8208;Tailored 1064&#8201;nm&#8208;Excitable Molecule for Photothermal Combating of Orthotopic Breast Cancer</title>

A 1064&#8197;nm&#8208;laser&#8208;excitable molecule with balanced radiative and non&#8208;radiative decay is fabricated by molecular engineering. Further work validated excellent trimodal NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (FLI)/NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic (PAI)/photothermal (PTI) imaging and good NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy (PTT) tumor ablation in orthotopic breast cancer mice models with negligible biotoxicity in vivo.







Abstract
The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) light&#8208;activated organic photothermal agent that synchronously enables satisfying NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging is highly warranted yet rather challenging on the basis of the overwhelming nonradiative decay. Herein, such an agent, namely TPABT&#8208;TD, was tactfully designed and constructed via employing benzo[c]thiophene moiety as bulky electron donor/&#960;&#8208;bridge and tailoring the peripheral molecular rotors. Benefitting from its high electron donor&#8211;acceptor strength and finely modulated intramolecular motion, TPABT&#8208;TD simultaneously exhibits ultralong absorption in NIR&#8208;II region, intense fluorescence emission in the NIR&#8208;IIa (1300&#8211;1500&#8197;nm) region as nanoaggregates, and high photothermal conversion upon 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Those intrinsic advantages endow TPABT&#8208;TD nanoparticles with prominent fluorescence/photoacoustic/photothermal trimodal imaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy against orthotopic 4T1 breast tumor with negligible adverse effect.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of C(sp3)&#8208;Rich Amines by Aminative Carbofunctionalization of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical synthesis of C(sp3)&#8208;rich amines by aminative carbofunctionalization of carbonyl compoundsElectrochemical aminative carbofunctionalization of carbonyl compounds was achieved under mild conditions without stringent exclusion of moisture and air. Complementary to existing photochemical methodologies, this catalyst&#8208;free electroreductive approach involves the coupling of cathodically generated nucleophilic &#945;&#8208;amino radicals with suitable radical acceptors, enabling the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;substituted amines with valuable molecular scaffolds.







Abstract
Alkylamines form the backbone of countless nitrogen&#8208;containing small molecules possessing desirable biological properties. Despite advances in amine synthesis through transition metal catalysis and photoredox chemistry, multicomponent reactions that leverage inexpensive materials to transform abundant chemical feedstocks into three&#8208;dimensional &#945;&#8208;substituted alkylamines bearing complex substitution patterns remain scarce. Here, we report the design of a catalyst&#8208;free electroreductive manifold that merges amines, carbonyl compounds and carbon&#8208;based radical acceptors under ambient conditions without rigorous exclusion of air and moisture. Key to this aminative carbofunctionalization process is the chemoselective generation of nucleophilic &#945;&#8208;amino radical intermediates that readily couple with electrophilic partners, providing straightforward access to architecturally intricate alkylamines and drug&#8208;like scaffolds which are inaccessible by conventional means.

         <title>Aerobic Oxidative Synthesis of Formamides from Amines and Bioderived Formyl Surrogates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aerobic oxidative N&#8208;formylation of amines to formamides by sustainable formyl surrogate derived from biobased feedstocks such as 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone, glyceraldehyde and glycolaldehyde is achieved over C3N4&#8208;supported single CuN4 sites with 100&#8201;% utilization efficiency of carbon atoms and much higher turnover frequency (TOF) than noble metal catalysts.







Abstract
Herein we present a new strategy for the oxidative synthesis of formamides from various types of amines and bioderived formyl sources (DHA, GLA and GLCA) and molecular oxygen (O2) as oxidant on g&#8208;C3N4 supported Cu catalysts. Combined characterization data from EPR, XAFS, XRD and XPS revealed the formation of single CuN4 sites on supported Cuphen/C3N4 catalysts. EPR spin trapping experiments disclosed &#8901;OOH radicals as reactive oxygen species and &#8901;NR1R2 radicals being responsible for the initial C&#8722;C bond cleavage. Control experiments and DFT calculations showed that the successive C&#8722;C bond cleavage in DHA proceeds via a reaction mechanism co&#8208;mediated by &#8901;NR1R2 and &#8901;OOH radicals based on the well&#8208;equilibrated CuII and CuI cycle. Our catalyst has much higher activity (TOF) than those based on noble metals.

         <title>Delocalizing Excitation for Highly&#8208;Active Organic Photovoltaic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron&#8208;phonon coupling in organic photovoltaic materials (2FBP&#8208;4F) was reduced through a rational fluoro&#8208;substituted strategy, promoting exciton delocalization. Polaron pairs and polarons were observed in 2FBP&#8208;4F nanoparticles, facilitating the generation of free charge. 2FBP&#8208;4F exhibited high photocatalytic performance in both single&#8208;component and heterojunction systems.







Abstract
Localized excitation in traditional organic photocatalysts typically prevents the generation and extraction of photo&#8208;induced free charge carriers, limiting their activity enhancement under illumination. Here, we enhance delocalized photoexcitation of small molecular photovoltaic catalysts by weakening their electron&#8208;phonon coupling via rational fluoro&#8208;substitution. The optimized 2FBP&#8208;4F catalyst we develop here exhibits a minimized Huang&#8211;Rhys factor of 0.35 in solution, high dielectric constant and strong crystallization in the solid state. As a result, the energy barrier for exciton dissociation is decreased, and more importantly, polarons are unusually observed in 2FBP&#8208;4F nanoparticles (NPs). With the increased hole transfer efficiency and prolonged charge carrier lifetime highly related to enhanced exciton delocalization, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;2FBP&#8208;4F heterojunction NPs at varied concentration exhibit much higher optimized photocatalytic activity (207.6&#8211;561.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) for hydrogen evolution than the control PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BP&#8208;4F and PM6&#8201;:&#8201;2FBP&#8208;6F NPs, as well as other reported photocatalysts under simulated solar light (AM 1.5G, 100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Polyfluorinated Organic Diammonium Induced Lead Iodide Arrangement for Efficient Two&#8208;Step&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells are developed by incorporating a polyfluorinated organic diammonium salt which cann't generate low&#8208;dimensional perovskites into the lead iodide precursor to change the arrangement of the lead iodide crystals. The resulting high&#8208;quality perovskite film with large grain size boost the efficiencies to 24.70&#8201;% and 21.04&#8201;% for cell (0.06&#8197;cm2) and module (100&#8197;cm2), respectively.







Abstract
The inefficient conversion of lead iodide to perovskite has become one of the major challenges in further improving the performance of perovskite solar cells fabricated by the two&#8208;step method. Herein, the discontinuous lead iodide layer realized by introduction of a polyfluorinated organic diammonium salt, octafluoro&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;diyl)&#8208;dimethanaminium (OFPP) iodide which does not form low&#8208;dimensional perovskites, can enable the satisfactory conversion of lead iodide into perovskite, leading to meliorated crystallinity and enlarged grains in the OFPP modulated perovskite (OFPP&#8208;PVK) film. Combined with the effective defect passivation, the OFPP&#8208;PVK films show enhanced charge mobility and suppressed charge recombination. Accordingly, the OFPP&#8208;based perovskite solar cells exhibit a champion efficiency of 24.76&#8201;% with better device stability. Moreover, a superior efficiency of 21.04&#8201;% was achieved in a large&#8208;area perovskite module (100&#8197;cm2). Our work provides a unique insight into the function of organic diammonium additive in boosting photovoltaic performance.

         <title>A Carbon&#8208;Caged Rhodamine Generating Nitrosoperoxycarbonate for Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first and visible light&#8208;triggered ONOOCO2&#8722; donor (NPCD565) was devised. Its photolysis generated a rhodamine dye along with two mild radicals, e.g., NO and CO2.&#8722;. Their further combination with O2 yields ONOOCO2&#8722;, homolysis of which yields two potent radicals NO2 and CO3.&#8722;, which were harnessed to induce immunogenic cell death of cancer cells. In mouse models, ablation of the primary tumor and suppression of the distant tumor were achieved.







Abstract
Photoimmunotherapy is a promising cancer treatment modality. While potent 1&#8208;e&#8722; oxidative species are known to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), they are also associated with unspecific oxidation and collateral tissue damage. This difficulty may be addressed by post&#8208;generation radical reinforcement. Namely, non&#8208;oxidative radicals are first generated and subsequently activated into powerful oxidative radicals to induce ICD. Here, we developed a photo&#8208;triggered molecular donor (NPCD565) of nitrosoperoxycarbonate (ONOOCO2&#8722;), the first of its class to our knowledge, and further evaluated its feasibility for immunotherapy. Upon irradiation of NPCD565 by light within a broad spectral region from ultraviolet to red, ONOOCO2&#8722; is released along with a bright rhodamine dye (RD565), whose fluorescence is a reliable and convenient build&#8208;in reporter for the localization, kinetics, and dose of ONOOCO2&#8722; generation. Upon photolysis of NPCD565 in 4T1 cells, damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) indicative of ICD were observed and confirmed to exhibit immunogenicity by induced maturation of dendritic cells. In vivo studies with a bilateral tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model showcased the potent tumor&#8208;killing capability of NPCD565 of the primary tumors and growth suppression of the distant tumors. This work unveils the potent immunogenicity of ONOOCO2&#8722;, and its donor (NPCD565) has broad potential for photo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer.

         <title>Single Crystal and Pentatwinned Gold Nanorods Result in Chiral Nanocrystals with Reverse Handedness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The handedness of chiral gold nanorods synthesized by seeded growth typically follows that of the organic chiral inducer, being right&#8208;handed when templated by S&#8208;BINAMINE micelles or induced by L&#8208;cystine (L&#8208;2cys). Our results demonstrate that a change in the achiral seed, from single crystalline to pentatwinned, can reverse the sign of circular dichroism (CD) measurements, adding a new effect to guide the chirality of gold nanoparticles.







Abstract
Handedness is an essential attribute of chiral nanocrystals, having a major influence on their properties. During chemical growth, the handedness of nanocrystals is usually tuned by selecting the corresponding enantiomer of chiral molecules involved in asymmetric growth, often known as chiral inducers. We report that, even using the same chiral inducer enantiomer, the handedness of chiral gold nanocrystals can be reversed by using Au nanorod seeds with either single crystalline or pentatwinned structure. This effect holds for chiral growth induced both by amino acids and by chiral micelles. Although it was challenging to discern the morphological handedness for L&#8208;cystine&#8208;directed particles, even using electron tomography, both cases showed circular dichroism bands of opposite sign, with nearly mirrored chiroptical signatures for chiral micelle&#8208;directed growth, along with quasi&#8208;helical wrinkles of inverted handedness. These results expand the chiral growth toolbox with an effect that might be exploited to yield a host of interesting morphologies with tunable optical properties.

         <title>An Expedient Radical Approach for the Decarboxylative Synthesis of Stereodefined All&#8208;Carbon Tetrasubstituted Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical&#8208;based, photo&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative formation of stereodefined tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted olefins is reported using various &#945;&#8208;amino radical precursors and heterocycles as substrates. This user&#8208;friendly protocol combines a wide structural scope, easy drug and postsynthetic manipulations, and variation in both reaction partners. The mechanistic studies reveal a key CO2 extrusion step to enable the overall transformation.







Abstract
We report a user&#8208;friendly approach for the decarboxylative formation of stereodefined and complex tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted olefins from vinyl cyclic carbonates and amines as radical precursors. The protocol relies on easy photo&#8208;initiated &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;radical formation followed by addition onto the double bond of the substrate resulting in a sequence involving carbonate ring&#8208;opening, double bond relay, CO2 extrusion and finally O&#8208;protonation. The developed protocol is efficient for both mismatched and matched polarity substrate combinations, and the scope of elaborate stereodefined olefins that can be forged including drug&#8208;functionalized derivatives is wide, diverse and further extendable to other types of heterocyclic and radical precursors. Mechanistic control reactions show that the decarboxylation step is a key driving force towards product formation, with the initial radical addition under steric control.

An effective strategy to obtain high&#8208;performance UV&#8208;CPL is proposed by constructing Ce3+&#8208;based 0D chiral HMHs. R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7 show large |glum| values of (1.3&#8211;1.5)&#215;10&#8722;2 and FM values of (4.5&#8211;5.8)&#215;10&#8722;3, which is superior to the reported UV&#8208;CPL active materials. The UV CP light from the fabricated CP&#8208;LEDs can trigger enantioselective photopolymerizations of diacetylene and yield polymerized products with anisotropy factors of CD up to &#177;3.9&#215;10&#8722;2.







Abstract
Ultraviolet circularly polarized luminescence (UV&#8208;CPL) with high photon energy shows great potential in polarized light sources and stereoselective photopolymerization. However, developing luminescent materials with high UV&#8208;CPL performance remains challenging. Here, we report a pair of rare earth Ce3+&#8208;based zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs), R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7, which exhibits characteristic UV emissions derived from the Ce 5d&#8211;4f transition. The compounds show simultaneously high photoluminescent quantum yields of (32&#8211;39)% and large luminescent dissymmetry factor (|glum|) values of (1.3&#8211;1.5)&#215;10&#8722;2. Thus, the figures of merits of R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7 are calculated to be (4.5&#8211;5.8)&#215;10&#8722;3, which are superior to the reported UV&#8208;CPL emissive materials. Additionally, nearly 91&#8201;% of their PL intensities at 300&#8197;K can be well preserved at 380&#8197;K (LED operating temperature) without phase transition or decomposition, demonstrating the excellent structural and optical thermal stabilities of R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7. Based on these enantiomers, the fabricated UV&#8208;emitting CP&#8208;LEDs exhibit high polarization degrees of &#177;1.0&#8201;%. Notably, the UV&#8208;CPL generated from the devices can significantly trigger the enantioselective photopolymerization of diacetylene with remarkable stereoselectivity, and consequently yield polymerized products with the anisotropy factors of circular dichroism (gCD) up to &#177;3.9&#215;10&#8722;2, outperforming other UV&#8208;CPL materials and demonstrating their great potential as UV&#8208;polarized light sources.

         <title>Isothermal Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals Driven by Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isothermal phase transitions via dynamic covalent chemistry have been unlocked in nematic arrays. A nematic aldehyde was on&#8208;surface treated with various amines, triggering diverse phase transitions driven by imination reactions. The unlocking of these new adaptable liquid crystal systems paves the way for the conception of programmable structural pathways and new materials capable of evolving by chemical stimuli and temperature modulation.







Abstract
The dynamic nature of calamitic liquid crystals is exploited to perform isothermal phase transitions driven by dynamic covalent chemistry. For this purpose, nematic (N) arrays based on aldehyde 1 were treated with different amines (A&#8211;E) in an on&#8208;surface process, which resulted in different isothermal phase transitions. These phase transformations were caused by in situ imination reactions and are dependent on the nature of the added amine. Transitions from the N to crystal (1A, 1E), isotropic (1B), and smectic (Sm) (1C, 1D) phases were achieved, while the resulting materials feature thermotropic liquid crystal behavior. A sequential transformation from the N 1 to the Sm 1C and then to the N 1B was achieved by coupling an imination to a transimination processes and adjusting the temperature. All of these processes were well characterized by microscopic, spectroscopic, and X&#8208;ray techniques, unlocking not only the constitutional but also the structural aspects of the phase transitions. This work provides new insights into designing constitutionally and structurally adaptable liquid crystal systems, paving the way toward the conception of programable evolutive pathways and adaptive materials.

         <title>Discovery of (&#177;)&#8208;Penindolenes Reveals an Unusual Indole Ring Cleavage Pathway Catalyzed by P450 Monooxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>

Novel enantiomeric natural indole terpenoids featuring a &#947;&#8208;lactam skeleton were isolated from a mangrove&#8208;derived endophytic fungus. The cytochrome P450 enzyme was identified to catalyze the C2&#8722;C3 double bond cleavage of indole ring to generate products with two keto groups during the biosynthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactam indole terpenoids. This is the first example of the oxidative cleavage of indole by a P450 monooxygenase.







Abstract
(&#177;)&#8208;Penindolenes A&#8722;D (1&#8211;4), the first representatives of indole terpenoids featuring a &#947;&#8208;lactam skeleton, were isolated from the mangrove&#8208;derived endophytic fungus Penicillium brocae MA&#8208;231. Our bioactivity tests revealed their potent antimicrobial and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. The biosynthetic reactions by the five enzymes PbaABCDE leading to &#947;&#8208;lactam ring formation were identified with heterologous expression and in vitro enzymatic assays. Remarkably, the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase PbaB and its homolog in Aspergillus oryzae catalyzed the 2,3&#8208;cleavage of the indole ring to generate two keto groups in 1. This is the first example of the oxidative cleavage of indole by a P450 monooxygenase. In addition, rare secondary amide bond formation by the glutamine synthetase&#8208;like enzyme PbaD was reported. These findings will contribute to the engineered biosynthesis of unnatural, bioactive indole terpenoids.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Crystal Structures of Lead Bromide Perovskite Nanocrystals through Trace Cadmium(II) Doping for Efficient Color&#8208;Saturated Green LEDs</title>

A trace Cd2+ doping into FAPbBr3 nanocrystals leads to the increase of exciton effective mass due to the slight perovskite octahedra distortion. Benefiting from enhanced exciton binding energy and almost unchanged Auger recombination rate, a highly efficient light&#8208;emitting diode with an external quantum efficiency of 29.4&#8201;% and 534&#8197;nm emission wavelength has been obtained.







Abstract
Decreasing perovskite nanocrystal size increases radiative recombination due to the quantum confinement effect, but also increases the Auger recombination rate which leads to carrier imbalance in the emitting layers of electroluminescent devices. Here, we overcome this trade&#8208;off by increasing the exciton effective mass without affecting the size, which is realized through the trace Cd2+ doping of formamidinium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals. We observe an ~2.7&#8197;times increase in the exciton binding energy benefiting from a slight distortion of the [BX6]4&#8722; octahedra caused by doping in the case of that the Auger recombination rate is almost unchanged. As a result, bright color&#8208;saturated green emitting perovskite nanocrystals with a photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;% are obtained. Cd2+ doping also shifts up the energy levels of the nanocrystals, relative to the Fermi level so that heavily n&#8208;doped emitters convert into only slightly n&#8208;doped ones; this boosts the charge injection efficiency of the corresponding light&#8208;emitting diodes. The light&#8208;emitting devices based on those nanocrystals reached a high external quantum efficiency of 29.4&#8201;% corresponding to a current efficiency of 123&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and showed dramatically improved device lifetime, with a narrow bandwidth of 22&#8197;nm and Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage coordinates of (0.20, 0.76) for color&#8208;saturated green emission for the electroluminescence peak centered at 534&#8197;nm, thus being fully compliant with the latest standard for wide color gamut displays.

         <title>Rechargeable Zn&#8208;H2O hydrolysis battery for hydrogen storage and production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed&#8208;loop process for H2 storage and production using Zn as an electron carrier to combine a Zn&#8208;H2O hydrolysis battery to generate H2 and an alkaline electrolyzer to regenerate Zn. The Zn&#8208;H2O system can be charged using cheap renewable energy and produce H2 on demand more than 600&#8197;times.







Abstract
Reactive metals hydrolysis offers significant advantages for hydrogen storage and production. However, the regeneration of common reactive metals (e.g., Mg, Al, etc.) is energy&#8208;intensive and produces unwanted byproducts such as CO2 and Cl2. Herein, we employ Zn as a reactive mediator that can be easily regenerated by electrolysis of ZnO in an alkaline solution with a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;99.9&#8201;%. H2 is produced in the same electrolyte by constructing a Zn&#8208;H2O hydrolysis battery consisting of a Zn anode and a Raney&#8208;Ni cathode to unlock the Zn&#8208;H2O reaction. The entire two&#8208;step water splitting reaction with a net energy efficiency of 70.4&#8201;% at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, the Zn&#8208;H2O system can be charged using renewable energy to produce H2 on demand and runs for 600 cycles only sacrificing 3.76&#8201;% energy efficiency. DFT calculations reveal that the desorption of H* on Raney&#8208;Ni (&#8722;0.30&#8197;eV) is closer to zero compared with that on Zn (&#8722;0.87&#8197;eV), indicating a faster desorption of H* at low overpotential. Further, a 24&#8197;Ah electrolyzer is demonstrated to produce H2 with a net energy efficiency of 65.5&#8201;%, which holds promise for its real application.

         <title>Unprecedented POSS&#8208;Linked 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with 2&#8208;Fold Interpenetrated scu or sqc Topology Regulated by Porphyrin Center for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topology of unprecedented POSS&#8208;linked 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has been revealed to show dependence on the central ions of porphyrin building block. Central metal ions of Co(II) and Zn(II) in porphyrin building block result in the formation of POSS&#8208;MTFPP&#8208;COFs with scu topology, while metal free and Ni central ions lead to POSS&#8208;MTFPP&#8208;COFs with symmetric sqc topology. The well&#8208;distributed porphyrin units in these COFs endow them with enhanced performance in both photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction and photocatalytic production of artemisinin.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of porphyrin center regulated three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with 2&#8208;fold interpenetrated scu or sqc topology have been investigated. These COFs exhibit unique structural features and properties, making them promising candidates for photocatalytic applications in CO2 reduction and artemisinin synthesis. The porphyrin center serves as an anchor for metal ions, allowing precise control over structures and functions of the frameworks. Furthermore, the metal coordination within the framework imparts desirable catalytic properties, enabling their potential use in photocatalytic reactions. Overall, these porphyrin center regulated metal&#8208;controlled COFs offer exciting opportunities for the development of advanced materials with tailored functionalities.

         <title>Ratiometric Afterglow Luminescent Imaging of Matrix Metalloproteinase&#8208;2 Activity via an Energy Diversion Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An MMP&#8208;2&#8208;activated and integrin &#945;v&#946;3&#8208;targeting ratiometric afterglow luminescent (AGL) nanoprobe RAG&#8208;RGD is reported, which is constructed in adoption of energy diversion (ED) of excited&#8208;state afterglow substrate (AG&#8208;8*) and cascade three&#8208;step energy transfer (ET) process.







Abstract
Ratiometric afterglow luminescent (AGL) probes are attractive for in vivo imaging due to their high sensitivity and signal self&#8208;calibration function. However, there are currently few ratiometric AGL probes available for imaging enzymatic activity in living organisms. Here, we present an energy diversion (ED) strategy that enables the design of an enzyme&#8208;activated ratiometric AGL probe (RAG&#8208;RGD) for in vivo afterglow imaging. The ED process provides RAG&#8208;RGD with a radiative transition for an &#8216;always on&#8217; 520&#8208;nm AGL signal (AGL520) and a cascade three&#8208;step energy transfer (ET) process for an &#8216;off&#8208;on&#8217; 710&#8208;nm AGL signal (AGL710) in response to a specific enzyme. Using matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2) as an example, RAG&#8208;RGD shows a significant ~11&#8208;fold increase in AGL710/AGL520 toward MMP&#8208;2. This can sensitively detect U87MG brain tumors through ratiometric afterglow imaging of MMP&#8208;2 activity, with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and deep imaging depth. Furthermore, by utilizing the self&#8208;calibration effect of ratiometric imaging, RAG&#8208;RGD demonstrated a strong negative correlation between the AGL710/AGL520 value and the size of orthotopic U87MG tumor, enabling accurate monitoring of orthotopic glioma growth in vivo. This ED process may be applied for the design of other enzyme&#8208;activated ratiometric afterglow probes for sensitive afterglow imaging.

         <title>Self&#8208;Inclusion Complexation of Electron&#8208;Accepting Guest into Electron&#8208;Donating Cyclic Host by Photoexcitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[5]arene bearing a &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety exhibited dual locally excited and exciplex emissions from out&#8208;state and in&#8208;state, respectively, in the excited state. The addition of guest molecules suppressed formation of the in&#8208;state in the excited state, resulting in observation of the single locally excited emission from the out&#8208;state.







Abstract
Self&#8208;inclusion complexes consisting of host&#8208;guest conjugates are one of the unique supramolecular structures because they form in&#8208;state and out&#8208;state depending on the external stimuli. Despite many reports of the stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;inclusion complex formation, study of the structural relaxation from out&#8208;state to in&#8208;state by photoexcitation has been unexplored. Herein, we report that an electron&#8208;donating host and an electron&#8208;accepting guest conjugate exhibits the structural relaxation from out&#8208;state to in&#8208;state by photoexcitation. Formation of the in&#8208;state in the excited state resulted in exciplex emission along with the locally excited emission from the out&#8208;state. Moreover, this structural relaxation by photoexcitation was suppressed not only by temperature, but also by the presence of guest molecules, resulting in changes in the ratio of the dual emission intensities.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Mediated Formation of C&#8722;N or C=N Bond during Photocatalytic Reductive Coupling Reaction over CdS Nanosheets</title>

Selective synthesis of C=N and C&#8722;N bonds was facilely achieved by manipulating the solvents via hydrogen&#8208;bond mediated transfer hydrogenation process over CdS photocatalyst.







Abstract
Reductive amination of carbonyl compounds and nitro compounds represents a straightforward way to attain imines or secondary amines, but it is difficult to control the product selectivity. Herein, we report the selective formation of C&#8722;N or C=N bond readily manipulated through a solvent&#8208;induced hydrogen bond bridge, facilitating the swift photocatalytic reductive coupling process. The reductive&#8208;coupling of nitro compounds with carbonyl compounds using formic acid and sodium formate as the hydrogen donors over CdS nanosheets selectively generates imines with C=N bonds in acetonitrile solvent; while taking methanol as solvent, the C=N bonds are readily hydrogenated to the C&#8722;N bonds via hydrogen&#8208;bonding activation. Experimental and theoretical study reveals that the building of the hydrogen&#8208;bond bridge between the hydroxyl groups in methanol and the N atoms of the C=N motifs in imines facilitates the transfer of hydrogen atoms from CdS surface to the N atoms in imines upon illumination, resulting in the rapid hydrogenation of the C=N bonds to give rise to the secondary amines with C&#8722;N bonds. Our method provides a simple way to control product selectivity by altering the solvents in photocatalytic organic transformations.

Iminium stencil. A cyclometallated imide exhibits a unique mode of action serving as a template for the H&#8208;bond directed approach of the substrate in the iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of N&#8208;methyl imines. A combined computational and experimental approach allowed us to develop the most selective and active catalysts described to date for the direct hydrogenation of this challenging class of substrates with up to 99&#8201;% ee and 3500&#8197;h&#8722;1 TOF.







Abstract
A combined computational and experimental approach allowed us to develop overall the most selective catalyst for the direct hydrogenation of N&#8208;methyl, N&#8208;alkyl and N&#8208;aryl imines described to date. Iridium catalysts with a cyclometallated cyclic imide group provide selectivity of up to 99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. Computational studies show that the selectivity results from the combined effect of H&#8208;bonding of the imide C=O with the substrate iminium ion and a stabilizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction with the cyclometallated ligand. The cyclometallated ligand thus exhibits a unique mode of action, serving as a template for the H&#8208;bond directed approach of the substrate which results in enhanced selectivity. The catalyst (2) has been synthesized and isolated as a crystalline air&#8208;stable solid. X&#8208;ray analysis of 2 confirmed the structure of the catalyst and the correct position of the imide C=O groups to engage in an H&#8208;bond with the substrate. 19F&#8197;NMR real&#8208;time monitoring showed the hydrogenation of N&#8208;methyl imines catalyzed by 2 is very fast, with a TOF of approx. 3500&#8197;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Micelles Cascade Assembly to Tandem Porous Catalyst for Waste Plastics Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micelle cascade assembly strategy is developed for synthesizing a tandem porous catalyst with hierarchical porous and acidic structures, which mimics natural protease catalytic clefts, exhibiting a high catalytic activity, selectivity and resistance to coking for the catalytic cracking of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) at a low temperature.







Abstract
Catalytic upcycling of polyolefins into high&#8208;value chemicals represents the direction in end&#8208;of&#8208;life plastics valorization, but poses great challenges. Here, we report the synthesis of a tandem porous catalyst via a micelle cascade assembly strategy for selectively catalytic cracking of polyethylene into olefins at a low temperature. A hierarchically porous silica layer from mesopore to macropore is constructed on the surface of microporous ZSM&#8208;5 nanosheets through cascade assembly of dynamic micelles. The outer macropore arrays can adsorb bulky polyolefins quickly by the capillary and hydrophobic effects, enhancing the diffusion and access to active sites. The middle mesopores present a nanoconfinement space, pre&#8208;cracking polyolefins into intermediates by weak acid sites, which then transport into zeolites micropores for further cracking by strong Br&#248;nsted acid sites. The hierarchically porous and acidic structures, mimicking biomimetic protease catalytic clefts, ideally match the tandem cracking steps of polyolefins, thus suppressing coke formation and facilitating product escape. As a result, light hydrocarbons (C1&#8208;C7) are produced with a yield of 443&#8197;mmol&#8201;gZSM&#8208;5&#8722;1, where 74.3&#8201;% of them are C3&#8208;C6 olefins, much superior to ZSM&#8208;5 and porous silica catalysts. This tandem porous catalyst exemplifies a superstructure design of catalytic cracking catalysts for industrial and economical upcycling of plastic wastes.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with a Ring&#8208;in&#8208;Ring Topology and High Electrical Conductance</title>

         <dc:description>
A new family of 2D conductive MOFs (named M&#8211;DHHBTN, M=Co, Ni, and Cu) with a unique ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring topology has been successfully constructed by using a highly branched and conjugated dodechydroxyhexabenzotrinaphthylene ligand, which offers the first example simultaneously achieving high electron conductivity and a heterogeneous dual&#8208;pore structure in 2D MOFs.







Abstract
Electrically conducting two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered significant interest due to their remarkable structural tunability and outstanding electrical properties. However, the design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance materials face challenges due to the limited availability of specific ligands and pore structures. In this study, we have employed a novel highly branched D3h symmetrical planar conjugated ligand, dodechydroxylhexabenzotrinaphthylene (DHHBTN) to fabricate a series of 2D conductive MOFs, named M&#8211;DHHBTN (M=Co, Ni, and Cu). This new family of MOFs offers two distinct types of pores, elevating the structural complexity of 2D conductive MOFs to a more advanced level. The intricate tessellation patterns of the M&#8211;DHHBTN are elucidated through comprehensive analyses involving powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, theoretical simulations, and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscope. Optical&#8208;pump terahertz&#8208;probe spectroscopic measurements unveiled carrier mobility in DHHBTN&#8208;based 2D MOFs spanning from 0.69 to 3.10&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Among M&#8211;DHHBTN famility, Cu&#8208;DHHBTN displayed high electrical conductivity reaching 0.21&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K with thermal activation behavior. This work leverages the &#8220;branched conjugation&#8221; of the ligand to encode heteroporosity into highly conductive 2D MOFs, underscoring the significant potential of heterogeneous double&#8208;pore structures for future applications.

Single crystals of a functional covalent organic polymer (COP, CityU&#8208;25) containing dative B&#8592;N bonds have been successfully prepared and their structure has been solved through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. CityU&#8208;25 as an anode in rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries displayed an excellent performance, evidenced by an impressive capacity of 673&#8197;mAh/g after 720 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A/g.







Abstract
Inspired by dative boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds proven to be the promising dynamic linkage for the construction of crystalline covalent organic polymers/frameworks (COPs/COFs), we employed 1,4&#8208;bis(benzodioxaborole) benzene (BACT) and N,N&#8242;&#8208;Di(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxdiimide (DPNTCDI) as the corresponding building blocks to construct a functional COP (named as CityU&#8208;25), which had been employed as an anode in rechargeable lithium ion batteries. CityU&#8208;25 displayed an excellent reversible lithium storage capability of 455&#8197;mAh/g after 170 cycles at 0.1&#8197;A/g, and an impressive one of 673&#8197;mAh/g after 720 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A/g. These findings suggest that CityU&#8208;25 is a standout candidate for advanced battery technologies, highlighting the potential application of this type of materials.

         <title>Highly Efficient One&#8208;pot Electrosynthesis of Oxime Ethers from NOx over Ultrafine MgO Nanoparticles Derived from Mg&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

A novel tandem electrochemical system for converting exhaust NOx into oxime ether is proposed and presents great efficiency over a developed MgO derived from MOF anchoring in nanofiber membrane, which offers great significance of NOx valorization to synthesize organonitrogen drug molecules in a sustainable and mild way.







Abstract
Oxime ethers are attractive compounds in medicinal scaffolds due to the biological and pharmaceutical properties, however, the crucial and widespread step of industrial oxime formation using explosive hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is insecure and troublesome. Herein, we present a convenient method of oxime ether synthesis in a one&#8208;pot tandem electrochemical system using magnesium based metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived magnesium oxide anchoring in self&#8208;supporting carbon nanofiber membrane catalyst (MgO&#8208;SCM), the in situ produced NH2OH from nitrogen oxides electrocatalytic reduction coupled with aldehyde to produce 4&#8208;cyanobenzaldoxime with a selectivity of 93&#8201;% and Faraday efficiency up to 65.1&#8201;%, which further reacted with benzyl bromide to directly give oxime ether precipitate with a purity of 97&#8201;% by convenient filtering separation. The high efficiency was attributed to the ultrafine MgO nanoparticles in MgO&#8208;SCM, effectively inhibiting hydrogen evolution reaction and accelerating the production of NH2OH, which rapidly attacked carbonyl of aldehydes to form oximes, but hardly crossed the hydrogenation barrier of forming amines, thus leading to a high yield of oxime ether when coupling benzyl bromide nucleophilic reaction. This work highlights the importance of kinetic control in complex electrosynthetic organonitrogen system and demonstrates a green and safe alternative method for synthesis of organic nitrogen drug molecules.

         <title>Cyclodextrin &#8216;Chaperones&#8217; Enable Quasi&#8208;Ideal Supramolecular Network Formation and Enhanced Photodimerization of Hydrophobic, Red&#8208;shifted Photoswitches in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrines serve as chaperones to solubilize and pre&#8208;order hydrophobic photoswitches with red&#8208;shifted activation wavelength in water, providing unique access to higher reactivity on a molecular scale and quasi&#8208;ideal hydrogel networks without phase segregation on the macroscale.







Abstract
Precision&#8208;engineered light&#8208;triggered hydrogels are important for a diversity of applications. However, fields such as biomaterials require wavelength outside the harsh UV regime to prevent photodamage, typically requiring chromophores with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation that suffer from poor water solubility. Herein, we demonstrate how cyclodextrins can be used as auxiliary agents to not only solubilize such chromophores, but even to preorganize them in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8208;guest inclusion complex to facilitate photodimerization. We apply our concept to styrylpyrene&#8208;end&#8208;functionalized star&#8208;shaped polyethylene glycols (sPEGs). We initially unravel details of the host&#8208;guest inclusion complex using spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to give clear evidence of a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 complex formation. Subsequently, we show that the resultant supramolecularly linked hydrogels conform to theories of supramolecular quasi&#8208;ideal model networks, and derive details on their association dynamics using in&#8208;depth rheological measurements and kinetic models. By comparing sPEGs of different arm length, we further elucidate the model network topology and the accessible mechanical property space. The photo&#8208;mediated dimerization proceeds smoothly, allowing to transform the supramolecular model networks into covalent ones. We submit that our strategy opens avenues for executing hydrophobic photochemistry in aqueous environments with enhanced control over reactivity, hydrogel topology or programmable mechanical properties.

         <title>Linker Mediated Electronic&#8208;State Manipulation of Conjugated Organic Polymers Enabling Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A viable linker engineering strategy is developed to construct a series of cobalt phthalocyanine conjugated polymers wrapped onto CNTs (CNTs@CoPc&#8208;CPs) as pyrolysis&#8208;free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). By altering the electronic properties of organic linkers, the optimal CNTs@bTDA&#8208;CoPc&#8208;CPs confers outstanding performance for the ORR and zinc&#8208;air batteries, representing the high performance among reported non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based catalysts to date.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers with tailorable composition and microarchitecture are propitious for modulating catalytic properties and deciphering inherent structure&#8208;performance relationships. Herein, we report a facile linker engineering strategy to manipulate the electronic states of metallophthalocyanine conjugated polymers and uncover the vital role of organic linkers in facilitating electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Specifically, a set of cobalt phthalocyanine conjugated polymers (CoPc&#8208;CPs) wrapped onto carbon nanotubes (denoted CNTs@CoPc&#8208;CPs) are judiciously crafted via in situ assembling square&#8208;planar cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine (CoPc(NH2)4) with different linear aromatic dialdehyde&#8208;based organic linkers in the presence of CNTs. Intriguingly, upon varying the electronic characteristic of organic linkers from terephthalaldehyde (TA) to 2,5&#8208;thiophenedicarboxaldehyde (TDA) and then to thieno/thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxaldehyde (bTDA), their corresponding CNTs@CoPc&#8208;CPs exhibit gradually improved electrocatalytic ORR performance. More importantly, theoretical calculations reveal that the charge transfer from CoPc units to electron&#8208;withdrawing linkers (i.e., TDA and bTDA) drives the delocalization of Co d&#8208;orbital electrons, thereby downshifting the Co d&#8208;band energy level. Accordingly, the active Co centers with more positive valence state exhibit optimized binding energy toward ORR&#8208;relevant intermediates and thus a balanced adsorption/desorption pathway that endows significant enhancement in electrocatalytic ORR. This work demonstrates a molecular&#8208;level engineering route for rationally designing efficient polymer catalysts and gaining insightful understanding of electrocatalytic mechanisms.

         <title>An Integrative Chemical Recycling Approach for Catalytic Oxidation of Epoxy Resin and in situ Separation of Degraded Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new recycling strategy integrating catalytic oxidation of epoxy resin and in situ separation of degraded products is developed, where the interaction between iron catalyst and reaction solvent makes the degradation under mild condition, while the supramolecular interactions between degraded products and iron catalyst contribute to the separation of mixed degraded products, which provides new ideas for upcycling of mixed plastic wastes.







Abstract
Although many approaches have been proposed to recycling waste epoxy resin (EP), the separation of mixed degraded products remains a challenge due to their similar structures. To address this, we present a catalytic oxidation strategy that enables mild degradation of EP and in situ separation of degraded products through supramolecular interactions. The oxidative degradation relies on FeIV=O radicals with strong oxidizing properties, which are generated from the electron transfer of FeCl2 with reaction reagents. As the FeIV=O radicals attacked the C&#8722;N bonds of EP, EP was broken into fragments rich in active functional groups. Meanwhile, the FeIV=O radicals were reduced to iron ions that can coordinate with the carboxyl groups on the fragments. As a result, the degraded products with different carboxyl content can be effortlessly separated into liquid and solid phase by coordinating with the catalyst. The success of this work lays the foundation for high&#8208;value application of degraded products and provides new design ideas for recycling waste plastics with complex compositions.

&lt;p&gt;A new recycling strategy integrating catalytic oxidation of epoxy resin and in situ separation of degraded products is developed, where the interaction between iron catalyst and reaction solvent makes the degradation under mild condition, while the supramolecular interactions between degraded products and iron catalyst contribute to the separation of mixed degraded products, which provides new ideas for upcycling of mixed plastic wastes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many approaches have been proposed to recycling waste epoxy resin (EP), the separation of mixed degraded products remains a challenge due to their similar structures. To address this, we present a catalytic oxidation strategy that enables mild degradation of EP and in situ separation of degraded products through supramolecular interactions. The oxidative degradation relies on Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;=O radicals with strong oxidizing properties, which are generated from the electron transfer of FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with reaction reagents. As the Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;=O radicals attacked the C&#8722;N bonds of EP, EP was broken into fragments rich in active functional groups. Meanwhile, the Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;=O radicals were reduced to iron ions that can coordinate with the carboxyl groups on the fragments. As a result, the degraded products with different carboxyl content can be effortlessly separated into liquid and solid phase by coordinating with the catalyst. The success of this work lays the foundation for high-value application of degraded products and provides new design ideas for recycling waste plastics with complex compositions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Built&#8208;in Electric Fields via Molecular Symmetry Modulation in Supramolecular Photocatalysts for Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing the power of symmetry breaking, our supramolecular photocatalyst showcases outstanding hydrogen evolution rate and quantum yield. Our study not only positions SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+ among the top performers in organic semiconductor photocatalysts but also demonstrates the method's effectiveness in boosting the efficiency of other catalysts, contributing to the advancement of solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion technologies.







Abstract
Nature&#8208;inspired supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies are attractive photocatalysts, but their quantum yields are limited by poor charge separation and transportation. A promising strategy for efficient charge transfer is to enhance the built&#8208;in electric field by symmetry breaking. Herein, an unsymmetric protonation, N&#8208;heterocyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated anthrazoline&#8208;based supramolecular photocatalyst SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+ was developed. The unsymmetric protonation breaks the initial structural symmetry of DADK, resulting in ca. 50&#8208;fold increase in the molecular dipole, and facilitates efficient charge separation and transfer within SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+. The protonation process also creates numerous active sites for H2O adsorption, and serves as crucial proton relays, significantly improving the photocatalytic efficiency. Remarkably, SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+ exhibits an outstanding hydrogen evolution rate of 278.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 25.1&#8201;% at 450&#8197;nm, placing it among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances in organic semiconductor photocatalysts. Furthermore, the versatility of the unsymmetric protonation approach has been successfully applied to four other photocatalysts, enhancing their photocatalytic performance by 39 to 533&#8197;times. These findings highlight the considerable potential of unsymmetric protonation induced symmetry breaking strategy in tailoring supramolecular photocatalysts for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel production.

         <title>Organo&#8208;Photocatalytic Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydroamidation of Alkenes with Sulfonyl Azides: A Combined Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalytic protocol to achieve anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydroamidation with sulfonyl azides in a highly efficient manner under mild conditions. A synergistic experimental and computational mechanistic study suggests a straightforward H&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) pathway in converting sulfonyl azide to the corresponding key amidyl radical.







Abstract
The construction of C(sp3)&#8722;N bonds via direct N&#8208;centered radical addition with olefins under benign conditions is a desirable but challenging strategy. Herein, we describe an organo&#8208;photocatalytic approach to achieve anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydroamidation with sulfonyl azides in a highly efficient manner under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and mild conditions. A broad range of substrates, including both activated and unactivated alkenes, are suitable for this protocol, providing a convenient and practical method to construct sulfonylamide derivatives. A synergistic experimental and computational mechanistic study suggests that the additive, Hantzsch ester (HE), might undergo a triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer manner to achieve photosensitization by the organo&#8208;photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. Next, the resulted triplet excited state 3HE* could lead to a homolytic cleavage of C4&#8722;H bond, which triggers a straightforward H&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) style in converting sulfonyl azide to the corresponding key amidyl radical. Subsequently, the addition of the amidyl radical to alkene followed by HAT from p&#8208;toluenethiol could proceed to afford the desired anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamidation product. It is worth noting that mechanistic pathway bifurcation could be possible for this reaction. A feasible radical chain propagation mechanistic pathway is also proposed to rationalize the high efficiency of this reaction.

         <title>Coral&#8208;Inspired Terahertz&#8208;Infrared Bi&#8208;Stealth Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative coral&#8208;structure inspired multi&#8208;scale composite foam has been successfully fabricated, pioneering the development of terahertz&#8208;infrared bi&#8208;stealth electronic skin. This bi&#8208;stealth system exhibits intelligent electromagnetic protection through autonomous perception, adapting to diverse operational environments and task demands with real&#8208;time responsiveness. Concurrently, it achieves infrared stealth with dynamic ambient temperatures.







Abstract
The development of electronic skin with dual stealth functionality is crucial for enabling devices to operate effectively in dynamic electromagnetic environments, thereby facilitating intelligent electromagnetic protection for autonomous perception. However, achieving compatibility between terahertz (THz) and infrared (IR) stealth technologies remains largely unexplored due to their inherent contradictions. Herein, inspired by natural corals, a novel coral&#8208;like multi&#8208;scale composite foam (CMSF) was proposed that ingeniously reconciles these contradictions. The design capitalizes on the conductive network and heat insulation properties of the foam skeleton, the loss effects and low infrared emission of metal particles, and the infrared transparency of magneto&#8208;optical materials. This approach leads to the realization of a THz&#8208;IR bi&#8208;stealth electronic skin concept. The CMSF exhibits a maximum reflection loss of 84.8&#8197;dB in the terahertz band, while its infrared stealth capability ensures environmental adaptability under varying temperatures. Furthermore, the electronic skin exhibits exceptional sensitivity and reliability as a wearable device for perceiving environmental changes. This advanced material, combining multispectral stealth with sensing capabilities, holds immense potential for applications ranging from camouflage technology to smart wearables.

         <title>Desulfurdioxidative N&#8208;N Coupling of N&#8208;Arylhydroxylamines and N&#8208;Sulfinylanilines: Reaction Development and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article describes a novel and practical strategy for N&#8722;N bond construction. The strategy involves an unprecedented intermolecular cascade O&#8208;sulfination and desulfurdioxidative N&#8722;N coupling (via stepwise retro&#8208;[2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition, supported by quantum chemistry calculations) from readily available N&#8208;arylhydroxylamines and N&#8208;sulfinylanilines under metal and oxidant free conditions.







Abstract
A highly efficient and chemoselective approach for the divergent assembling of unsymmetrical hydrazines through an unprecedented intermolecular desulfurdioxidative N&#8722;N coupling is developed. This metal free protocol employs readily accessible N&#8208;arylhydroxylamines and N&#8208;sulfinylanilines to provide highly valuable hydrazine products with good reaction yields and excellent functional group tolerance under simple conditions. Computational studies suggest that the in situ generated O&#8208;sulfenylated arylhydroxylamine intermediate undergoes a retro&#8208;[2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition via a stepwise diradical mechanism to form the N&#8722;N bond and release SO2.

         <title>M&#8722;N3 Configuration on Boron Nitride Boosts Singlet Oxygen Generation via Peroxymonosulfate Activation for Selective Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of boron nitride&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (BvBN/M, M=Co, Fe, Cu, Ni and Mn) with explicit M&#8722;N3 sites have been constructed via a vacancy control and coordination anchoring strategy, which overcome the difficulties in efficient and universal 1O2 generation by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS), thus achieving impressive selectivity and conversion rate for the transformation of aromatic alcohols to aldehydes under mild conditions.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an essential reactive species responsible for selective oxidation of organic matter, especially in Fenton&#8208;like processes. However, due to the great limitations in synthesizing catalysts with well&#8208;defined active sites, the controllable production and practical application of 1O2 remain challenging. Herein, guided by theoretical simulations, a series of boron nitride&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (BvBN/M, M=Co, Fe, Cu, Ni and Mn) were synthesized to regulate 1O2 generation by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). All the fabricated BvBN/M catalysts with explicit M&#8722;N3 sites promoted the self&#8208;decomposition of the two PMS molecules to generate 1O2 with high selectivity, where BvBN/Co possessed moderate adsorption energy and d&#8208;band center exhibited superior catalytic activity. As an outcome, the BvBN/Co&#8208;PMS system coupled with membrane filtration technology could continuously transform aromatic alcohols to aldehydes with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity and conversion rate under mild conditions, suggesting the potential of this novel catalytic system for green organic synthesis.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Unconventional Phase Alloy Nanobranches for Highly Selective Electrocatalytic Nitrite Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general one&#8208;pot method has been developed to synthesize unconventional phase Ir&#8208;based alloy nanostrucrtures. Notably, hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) IrNi nanobranches demonstrate superior catalytic performance towards ammonia electrosynthesis from nitrite over the conventional phase counterpart. Mechanism studies reveal that Ir&#8722;Ni interactions within hcp IrNi alloy improve electron transfer to benefit both nitrite activation and active hydrogen generation, leading to the highly selective formation of ammonia.







Abstract
The controlled synthesis of metal nanomaterials with unconventional phases is of significant importance to develop high&#8208;performance catalysts for various applications. However, it remains challenging to modulate the atomic arrangements of metal nanomaterials, especially the alloy nanostructures that involve different metals with distinct redox potentials. Here we report the general one&#8208;pot synthesis of IrNi, IrRhNi and IrFeNi alloy nanobranches with unconventional hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) phase. Notably, the as&#8208;synthesized hcp IrNi nanobranches demonstrate excellent catalytic performance towards electrochemical nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR), with superior NH3 Faradaic efficiency and yield rate of 98.2&#8201;% and 34.6&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 (75.5&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgIr&#8722;1) at 0 and &#8722;0.1&#8197;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), respectively. Ex/in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Ir&#8722;Ni interactions within hcp IrNi alloy improve electron transfer to benefit both nitrite activation and active hydrogen generation, leading to a stronger reaction trend of NO2RR by greatly reducing energy barriers of rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Cascade Dearomatization of Indoles via a Photoinduced Pd&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Bisfunctionalization of Butadienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a cascade asymmetric dearomatization reaction of indoles via photoinduced Pd&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;biscarbonfunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadienes has been disclosed. This process delivers structurally novel chiral spiroindolenines bearing two contiguous stereogenic centers with high diastereomeric ratios (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr) and good to excellent enantiomeric ratios (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er).







Abstract
Photoinduced Pd&#8208;catalyzed bisfunctionalization of butadienes with a readily available organic halide and a nucleophile represents an emerging and attractive method to assemble versatile alkenes bearing various functional groups at the allylic position. However, enantiocontrol and/or diastereocontrol in the C&#8722;C or C&#8722;X bond&#8208;formation step have not been solved due to the open&#8208;shell process. Herein, we present a cascade asymmetric dearomatization reaction of indoles via photoexcited Pd&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;biscarbonfunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadienes, wherein asymmetric control on both the nucleophile and electrophile part is achieved for the first time in photoinduced bisfunctionalization of butadienes. This method delivers structurally novel chiral spiroindolenines bearing two contiguous stereogenic centers with high diastereomeric ratios (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr) and good to excellent enantiomeric ratios (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er). Experimental and computational studies of the mechanism have confirmed a radical pathway involving excited&#8208;state palladium catalysis. The alignment and non&#8208;covalent interactions between the substrate and the catalyst were found to be essential for stereocontrol.

         <title>Supramolecular Entanglement in a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Enables Flexible&#8208;Robust Porosity for Highly Efficient Purification of Natural Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a novel flexible&#8208;robust HOF material with abundant supramolecular entanglements by weak intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonds, enabling the construction of flexible&#8208;robust porosity to be opened by C3H8 and n&#8208;C4H10 molecules for notably improving the C3H8/CH4 and n&#8208;C4H10/CH4 separation performance.







Abstract
The development of porous materials with flexible&#8208;robust characteristics shows some unique advantages to target high performance for gas separation, but remains a daunting challenge to achieve so far. Herein, we report a carboxyl&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;8a) with flexible&#8208;robust porosity for efficient purification of natural gas. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;8a features a four&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure with dia topology, wherein abundant supramolecular entanglements are formed between the adjacent subnetworks through weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This structural configuration could not only stabilize the whole framework to establish the permanent porosity, but also enable the framework to show some flexibility due to its weak intermolecular interactions (so&#8208;called flexible&#8208;robust framework). The flexible&#8208;robust porosity of ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;8a was exclusively confirmed by gas sorption isotherms and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, showing that the flexible pore pockets can be opened by C3H8 and n&#8208;C4H10 molecules rather by C2H6 and CH4. This leads to notably higher C3H8 and n&#8208;C4H10 uptakes with enhanced selectivities than C2H6 over CH4 under ambient conditions, affording one of the highest n&#8208;C4H10/CH4 selectivities. The gas&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal structures coupled with theoretical simulations reveal that the loading of n&#8208;C4H10 can induce an obvious framework expansion along with pore pocket opening to improve n&#8208;C4H10 uptake and selectivity, while not for C2H6 adsorption. This work suggests an effective strategy of designing flexible&#8208;robust HOFs for improving gas separation properties.

This leads to notably higher C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and n-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; uptakes with enhanced selectivities than C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; over CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; under ambient conditions, affording one of the highest n-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivities. The gas-loaded single-crystal structures coupled with theoretical simulations reveal that the loading of n-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; can induce an obvious framework expansion along with pore pocket opening to improve n-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; uptake and selectivity, while not for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption. This work suggests an effective strategy of designing flexible-robust HOFs for improving gas separation properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Valuable formamides were &#8220;pulled out of the hat&#8221; upon reaction of amines with biomass&#8208;based starting materials such as 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone, glycolaldehyde and glycerolaldehyde by avoiding any waste products using environmentally benign oxygen as oxidant, as reported by Haijun Jiao, Feng Shi, Jabor Rabeah, Angelika Br&#252;ckner et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402241). This reaction may be regarded as &#8220;green&#8221; and somehow &#8220;magic".

Enantiopure irida[6]helicenes combining chirality at the metal center and at the helicenic fragment are obtained by dynamic kinetic resolution of configurationally labile [4]helicenic ligands. These compounds exhibit perfect mirrored electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) signals, as described by Carlos M. Cruz, Fernando P. Coss&#237;o, Zoraida Freixa, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202406663).

         <title>Quantitative Factors Introduced in the Feasibility Analysis of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)&#8208;Sensitive Triggers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Success of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) triggered prodrug activation relies on two key functions: (1) sufficient magnitude of concentration difference for the interested ROS between normal tissue/cells and the intended site of delivery, (2) appropriate reaction kinetics to ensure a sufficient level of payload release. Herein, we examine ROS concentrations under various pathophysiological conditions and critically analyze ROS&#8208;triggered prodrug.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical for cellular signaling. Various pathophysiological conditions are also associated with elevated levels of ROS. Hence, ROS&#8208;sensitive triggers have been extensively used for selective payload delivery. Such applications are predicated on two key functions: (1) a sufficient magnitude of concentration difference for the interested ROS between normal tissue/cells and intended sites and (2) appropriate reaction kinetics to ensure a sufficient level of selectivity for payload release. Further, ROS refers to a group of species with varying reactivity, which should not be viewed as a uniform group. In this review, we critically analyze data on the concentrations of different ROS species under various pathophysiological conditions and examine how reaction kinetics affect the success of ROS&#8208;sensitive linker chemistry. Further, we discuss different ROS linker chemistry in the context of their applications in drug delivery and imaging. This review brings new insights into research in ROS&#8208;triggered delivery, highlights factors to consider in maximizing the chance for success and discusses pitfalls to avoid.

         <title>The 18F&#8208;Difluoromethyl Group: Challenges, Impact and Outlook</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>

This Minireview summarises the progress radiochemists have made to access the difluoromethyl group in radiolabelled form. Particular attention is given to challenges they have faced, as well as the strategies employed to access this new radiochemical space.







Abstract
The difluoromethyl functionality has proven useful in drug discovery, as it can modulate the properties of bioactive molecules. For PET imaging, this structural motif has been largely underexploited in (pre)clinical radiotracers due to a lack of user&#8208;friendly radiosynthetic routes. This Minireview provides an overview of the challenges facing radiochemists and summarises the efforts made to date to access 18F&#8208;difluoromethyl&#8208;containing radiotracers. Two distinct approaches have prevailed, the first of which relies on 18F&#8208;fluorination. A second approach consists of a 18F&#8208;difluoromethylation process, which uses 18F&#8208;labelled reagents capable of releasing key reactive intermediates such as the [18F]CF2H radical or [18F]difluorocarbene. Finally, we provide an outlook for future directions in the radiosynthesis of [18F]CF2H compounds and their application in tracer radiosynthesis.

         <title>Reaction Environment Regulation for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>

This review explores advancements in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) in acidic electrolytes, focusing on engineering reaction environments. It discusses strategies for electrocatalyst design, electrode modification, and electrolyte optimization to enhance CO2RR while suppressing hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a sustainable route for converting CO2 into value&#8208;added fuels and feedstocks, advancing a carbon&#8208;neutral economy. The electrolyte critically influences CO2 utilization, reaction rate and product selectivity. While typically conducted in neutral/alkaline aqueous electrolytes, the CO2RR faces challenges due to (bi)carbonate formation and its crossover to the anolyte, reducing efficiency and stability. Acidic media offer promise by suppressing these processes, but the low Faradaic efficiency, especially for multicarbon (C2+) products, and poor electrocatalyst stability persist. The effective regulation of the reaction environment at the cathode is essential to favor the CO2RR over the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improve long&#8208;term stability. This review examines progress in the acidic CO2RR, focusing on reaction environment regulation strategies such as electrocatalyst design, electrode modification and electrolyte engineering to promote the CO2RR. Insights into the reaction mechanisms via in situ/operando techniques and theoretical calculations are discussed, along with critical challenges and future directions in acidic CO2RR technology, offering guidance for developing practical systems for the carbon&#8208;neutral community.

Chemistry has the potential to drive global sustainability efforts, but how to ensure its optimal impact is not always obvious. Through analysis of green, circular, and sustainable chemistry concepts, this Scientific Perspective identifies unified triple&#8197;E priorities, covering environmental, economic, and equity pillars, and categorizes associated metrics. Case studies illustrate how these can be used to guide research and decisions.







Abstract
Chemistry, a vital tool for sustainable development, faces a challenge due to the lack of clear guidance on actionable steps, hindering the optimal adoption of sustainability practices across its diverse facets from discovery to implementation. This Scientific Perspective explores established frameworks and principles, proposing a conciliated set of triple&#8197;E priorities anchored on Environmental, Economic, and Equity pillars for research and decision making. We outline associated metrics, crucial for quantifying impacts, classifying them according to their focus areas and scales tackled. Emphasizing catalysis as a key driver of sustainable synthesis of chemicals and materials, we exemplify how triple&#8197;E priorities can practically guide the development and implementation of processes from renewables conversions to complex customized products.

     alt="The Future of Chemical Sciences is Sustainable"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemistry has the potential to drive global sustainability efforts, but how to ensure its optimal impact is not always obvious. Through analysis of green, circular, and sustainable chemistry concepts, this Scientific Perspective identifies unified &lt;i&gt;triple&#8197;E&lt;/i&gt; priorities, covering environmental, economic, and equity pillars, and categorizes associated metrics. Case studies illustrate how these can be used to guide research and decisions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemistry, a vital tool for sustainable development, faces a challenge due to the lack of clear guidance on actionable steps, hindering the optimal adoption of sustainability practices across its diverse facets from discovery to implementation. This Scientific Perspective explores established frameworks and principles, proposing a conciliated set of &lt;i&gt;triple&#8197;E&lt;/i&gt; priorities anchored on &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;nvironmental, &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;conomic, and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;quity pillars for research and decision making. We outline associated metrics, crucial for quantifying impacts, classifying them according to their focus areas and scales tackled. Emphasizing catalysis as a key driver of sustainable synthesis of chemicals and materials, we exemplify how &lt;i&gt;triple&#8197;E&lt;/i&gt; priorities can practically guide the development and implementation of processes from renewables conversions to complex customized products. We summarize by proposing a roadmap for the community aimed at raising awareness, fostering academia&#8211;industry collaboration, and stimulating further advances in sustainable chemical technologies across their broad scope.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Transannulation En Route to N&#8722;N Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers by denitrogenative annulation of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazones with internal alkynes is presented. A wide variety of N&#8722;N atropisomers were synthesized with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed transannulation reactions triggered by the extrusion of small gaseous molecules have emerged as a powerful strategy for the efficient construction of heterocyclic compounds. However, their use in asymmetric synthesis remains challenging because of the difficulty in controlling stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers by the denitrogenative transannulation of benzotriazones with alkynes. A broad range of N&#8722;N atropisomers was obtained with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity under mild conditions. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction mechanism and enantioselectivity control.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Secretoglobin 3A2 Covalent Homodimer and Photocaged Monomeric Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2 is a small, secreted protein present only in mammals. Despite its unique self&#8208;assembly driven by disulfide dimerization and non&#8208;covalent oligomerization, current understanding of its physiology relies solely on in vivo and complex ex vivo mixtures. SCGB3A2 chemical synthesis using KAHA ligation now enables access to monomeric and homodimeric SCGB3A2 analogues for studying its self&#8208;assembly behavior.







Abstract
Secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2 belongs to an intriguing family of small, secreted proteins present only in mammals. Although members of the SCGB protein family have distinct amino acid sequences, they share structural similarities. Of particularly interest is the not yet fully understood self&#8208;assembly ability of SCGBs, which arise from covalent disulfide dimerization and non&#8208;covalent oligomerization. Recently, SCGB3A2 has attracted attention for its singular expression profile in airways. However, the knowledge on SCGB3A2 (patho)physiology derives exclusively from in vivo and complex ex vivo mixtures, which hampers characterization of the mechanisms driving SCGB3A2 structural behavior. Herein, we document the chemical synthesis of SCGB3A2 in multi&#8208;milligram quantities. Key to access both monomeric and homodimeric SCGB3A2 analogues was the use of KAHA ligation and enabled masking of the cysteine residue. The synthetic proteins were used to investigate the SCGB3A2 self&#8208;assembly profile, confirming their high propensity to dimerization even in the absence of the key Cys residue.

         <title>DOTA&#8208;Based Plectin&#8208;1 Targeted Contrast Agent Enables Detection of Pancreatic Cancer in Human Tissue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has one of the lowest survival rates which is related to the lack of diagnostic tools for early detection. In this study, we developed a DOTA&#8208;based fluorescent probe targeting plectin&#8208;1 that significantly improves imaging of PDAC in human tissue and in vivo. These results demonstrate the great potential of the probe to enable early PDAC diagnosis.







Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive and lethal malignancy with extremely poor patient survival rates. A key reason for the poor prognosis is the lack of effective diagnostic tools to detect the disease at curable, premetastatic stages. Tumor surgical resection is PDAC's first&#8208;line treatment, however distinguishing between cancerous and healthy tissue with current imaging tools remains a challenge. In this work, we report a DOTA&#8208;based fluorescent probe targeting plectin&#8208;1 for imaging PDAC with high specificity. To enable heterogeneous functionalization of the DOTA&#8208;core with multiple targeting peptide units and the fluorophore, a novel, fully clickable synthetic route that proceeds in one pot was developed. Extensive validation of the probe set the stage for PDAC detection in mice and human tissue. Altogether, these findings may pave the way for improved clinical understanding and early detection of PDAC progression as well as more accurate resection criteria.

The unprecedented ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage functionalization with easily accessible sulfonium salts enabled the C&#8722;H arylation of medicinally relevant N&#8208;aryl triazoles and tetrazoles.







Abstract
The late&#8208;stage functionalization of active pharmaceutical ingredients is a key challenge in medicinal chemistry. Furthermore, N&#8208;aryl triazoles and tetrazoles are important structural motifs with the potential to boost the activity of diverse drug molecules. Using easily accessible dibenzothiophenium salts for the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation, these scaffolds were introduced into a variety of bioactive compounds. Our methodology uses cost&#8208;efficient ruthenium, KOAc as a mild base and gives access to a plethora of highly decorated triazole and tetrazole containing drug derivatives.

         <title>Accessing Z&#8208;Enynes via Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Propargylic Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Z&#8208;selective propargylic dehydrogenation is described. Alkynes and allenes are transformed to 1,3&#8208;enynes with moderate Z&#8208;selectivity. Deprotonation is identified as rate&#8208;limiting, and the observed Z&#8208;selectivity is a kinetic effect.







Abstract
Alkenes constitute an enabling motif in organic synthesis, as they can be functionalized to form highly substituted molecules. Z&#8208;alkenes are generally challenging to access due to the thermodynamic preference for the formation of E&#8208;alkenes compared to Z&#8208;alkenes. Dehydrogenation methodologies to selectively form Z&#8208;alkenes have not yet been reported. Herein, we report a Z&#8208;selective, propargylic dehydrogenation that provides 1,3&#8208;enynes through the invention of a Co&#8208;catalyzed oxidation system. Observation of a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) revealed that deprotonation of the propargylic position is the rate limiting step. Additionally, isomerization experiments were conducted and confirmed that the observed Z&#8208;selectivity is a kinetic effect. A proposed stereomechanistic model for the Z&#8208;selectivity is included.

     alt="Accessing Z-Enynes via Cobalt-Catalyzed Propargylic Dehydrogenation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cobalt-catalyzed &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selective propargylic dehydrogenation is described. Alkynes and allenes are transformed to 1,3-enynes with moderate &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity. Deprotonation is identified as rate-limiting, and the observed &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity is a kinetic effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkenes constitute an enabling motif in organic synthesis, as they can be functionalized to form highly substituted molecules. &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-alkenes are generally challenging to access due to the thermodynamic preference for the formation of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-alkenes compared to &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-alkenes. Dehydrogenation methodologies to selectively form &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-alkenes have not yet been reported. Herein, we report a &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selective, propargylic dehydrogenation that provides 1,3-enynes through the invention of a Co-catalyzed oxidation system. Observation of a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) revealed that deprotonation of the propargylic position is the rate limiting step. Additionally, isomerization experiments were conducted and confirmed that the observed &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity is a kinetic effect. A proposed stereomechanistic model for the &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity is included.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photogeneration of Chlorine Radical from a Self&#8208;Assembled Fluorous 4CzIPN&#8226;Chloride Complex: Application in C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorous photoredox catalyst 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN (Rf8=C8F17) forms a supramolecular complex with chloride ions with high affinity. Integrating fluorous chains on the parent dye greatly enhances both the ion&#8208;binding affinity, as well as the oxidizing ability of the catalyst. Efficient photooxidation of the chloride was observed, generating the chlorine HAT reagent, which was tested in the redox&#8208;neutral Giese&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;H bond alkylation reaction.







Abstract
The chlorine radical is a strong HAT (Hydrogen Atom Transfer) agent that is very useful for the functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. Albeit highly attractive, its generation from the poorly oxidizable chloride ion mediated by an excited photoredox catalyst is a difficult task. We now report that 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN, an electron&#8208;deficient fluorous derivative of the benchmark 4CzIPN photoredox catalyst belonging to the donor&#8208;acceptor carbazole&#8208;cyanoarene family, is not only a better photooxidant than 4CzIPN, but also becomes an excellent host for the chloride ion. Combining these two properties ultimately makes the self&#8208;assembled 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN&#8226;Cl&#8722; dual catalyst highly reactive in redox&#8208;neutral Giese&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;H bond alkylation reactions promoted by the chlorine radical. Additionally, because of its fluorous character, the efficient separation/recovery of 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN could be envisioned.

         <title>The CF3 Group as a Synthon of the CF+ Unit in Palladium Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>

Pulling fluorine off: The unusually high activity of the C&#8722;F bond found in the homoleptic trifluoromethyl&#8208;palladium(II) complex [Pd(CF3)4]2&#8722; is correlated to the very low fluoride&#8208;ion affinity of the conjugate difluorocarbene complex [(CF3)3Pd(CF2)]&#8722;, which is experimentally detected. Selective single, double or triple defluorination of a CF3 group is achieved under very mild conditions.







Abstract
The homoleptic trifluoromethyl&#8208;palladium(II) complex [Pd(CF3)4]2&#8722; (1) is shown to be highly active towards amines. Thus, when treated with primary amines RNH2, it readily undergoes aminolysis of one of the CF3 ligands affording the isocyanide complexes [(CF3)3Pd(CNR)]&#8722; (R=aryl). In this process the original CF3 group undergoes total defluorination. Interestingly, the reaction of 1 with secondary amines R2NH proceeds with loss of just two F&#8208;substituents, whereby the Fischer&#8208;type fluoroaminocarbene complexes [(CF3)3Pd(CFNR2)]&#8722; are formed (R=Et, Ph). The reaction of 1 with diamines affords different [(CF3)3Pd(NHC)]&#8722; complexes containing sterically non&#8208;demanding NHC ligands. Representative examples of various topologies are reported based on the common imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene or benzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene rings as well as the expanded&#8208;ring perimidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene. This metal&#8208;tailored synthetic route, where a CF3 group acts as a pre&#8208;carbenic unit, is unprecedented in the vast NHC&#8208;chemistry. It takes place under very mild conditions and is envisaged to be extensible to other non&#8208;isolable NHC ligands. The key difluorocarbene intermediate [(CF3)3Pd(CF2)]&#8722; is experimentally detected.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Sensor Based on Steric Hindrance Regulated Molecular Packing for In Vivo Epilepsy Visualization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new fluorescence sensing mechanism is presented by using steric hindrance quenchers to regulate the molecular packing state of fluorophores. The ClO&#8722; generation process in living epileptic mice brain is visualized by the SHINE sensor.







Abstract
Fluorescence sensing is crucial to studying biological processes and diagnosing diseases, especially in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window with reduced background signals. However, it's still a great challenge to construct &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; sensors when the sensing wavelength extends into the NIR&#8208;II region to obtain higher imaging contrast, mainly due to the difficult synthesis of spectral overlapped quencher. Here, we present a new fluorescence quenching strategy, which utilizes steric hindrance quencher (SHQ) to tune the molecular packing state of fluorophores and suppress the emission signal. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that large SHQs can competitively pack with fluorophores and prevent their self&#8208;aggregation. Based on this quenching mechanism, a novel activatable &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; sensing method is achieved via bio&#8208;analyte responsive invalidation of SHQ, namely the Steric Hindrance Invalidation geNerated Emission (SHINE) strategy. As a proof of concept, the ClO&#8722;&#8208;sensitive SHQ lead to the bright NIR&#8208;II signal release in epileptic mouse hippocampus under the skull and high photon scattering brain tissue, providing the real&#8208;time visualization of ClO&#8722; generation process in living epileptic mice.

         <title>Umbrella&#8208;Shaped Amphiphiles: Internal Alkylation of an Aromatic Micelle and Its Impact on Cavity Features</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internally multi&#8208;alkylated aromatic micelles are assembled in water from umbrella&#8208;shaped amphiphiles featuring a linear alkyl chain flanked by two polyaromatic panels. The alkylation strongly enhances the stability of the novel micelles against dilution and heat. Notably, thanks to the softness of the fully alkyl&#8208;filled cavity, efficient uptake of large metallodyes and pseudorotaxane&#8208;like binding of cycloparaphenylenes is achieved.







Abstract
To develop new hybrid micelles with alkyl/polyaromatic core&#8211;shell structures, we synthesized umbrella&#8208;shaped amphiphiles bearing a bent anthracene dimer with a linear alkyl chain (i.e., octyl and hexadecyl groups).

     alt="Umbrella-Shaped Amphiphiles: Internal Alkylation of an Aromatic Micelle and Its Impact on Cavity Features"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally multi-alkylated aromatic micelles are assembled in water from umbrella-shaped amphiphiles featuring a linear alkyl chain flanked by two polyaromatic panels. The alkylation strongly enhances the stability of the novel micelles against dilution and heat. Notably, thanks to the softness of the fully alkyl-filled cavity, efficient uptake of large metallodyes and pseudorotaxane-like binding of cycloparaphenylenes is achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To develop new hybrid micelles with alkyl/polyaromatic core&#8211;shell structures, we synthesized umbrella-shaped amphiphiles bearing a bent anthracene dimer with a linear alkyl chain (i.e., octyl and hexadecyl groups). The amphiphiles quantitatively assemble into spherical micelles (~2&#8211;3&#8197;nm in core diameter), possessing an alkylated cavity surrounded by a polyaromatic framework, in water. The alkylation significantly enhances the stability of the micellar structures against dilution (up to 9&#8197;&#956;M) and heat (up to &amp;gt;120&#8201;&#176;C). The highly condensed hexadecyl core of the hybrid micelle, as indicated by solvatochromic guest probes, displays increased uptake ability toward large alkylated metallodyes. Interestingly, efficient uptake of aromatic macrocycles (i.e., [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]cycloparaphenylenes) by the present micelle provides pseudorotaxane-shaped host&#8211;guest composites with high emissivity (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;=up to 35&#8201;%). Internal multi-alkylation of an aromatic micelle can thus successfully enhance its assembly stability/guest uptake functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organometallic Chirality Sensing via &#8220;Click&#8221;&#8208;Like &#951;6&#8208;Arene Coordination with an Achiral Cp*Ru(II) Piano Stool Complex</title>

Molecular recognition of chiral compounds through click&#8208;like &#951;6&#8208;arene coordination with a readily available ruthenium piano stool complex and its use in an optical CD/UV relay assay allow time&#8208;efficient chromatography&#8208;free stereochemical analysis of a broad range of challenging molecules.







Abstract
Piano stool complexes have been studied over many years and found widespread applications in organic synthesis, catalysis, materials and drug development. We now report the first examples of quantitative chiroptical molecular recognition of chiral compounds through click&#8208;like &#951;6&#8208;arene coordination with readily available half sandwich complexes. This conceptually new approach to chirality sensing is based on irreversible acetonitrile displacement of [Cp*Ru(CH3CN)3]PF6 by an aromatic target molecule, a process that is fast and complete within a few minutes at room temperature. The metal coordination coincides with characteristic circular dichroism inductions that can be easily correlated to the absolute configuration and enantiomeric ratio of the bound molecule. A relay assay that decouples the determination of the enantiomeric composition and of the total sample amount by a practical CD/UV measurement protocol was developed and successfully tested. The introduction of piano stool complexes to the chiroptical sensing realm is mechanistically unique and extends the scope of currently known methods with small&#8208;molecule probes that require the presence of amino, alcohol, carboxylate or other privileged functional groups for binding of the target compound. A broad application range including pharmaceutically relevant multifunctional molecules and the use in chromatography&#8208;free asymmetric reaction analysis are also demonstrated.

         <title>Linkage Engineering in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic C2H4 Production from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are constructed by linkage engineering to efficiently catalyze the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The catalytic array structure composed of sp3 N sites in the aminal linkages promotes CO2 capture and enhances the reaction kinetics for C2H4 production, thus showing a much higher Faraday efficiency of C2H4 than imine&#8208;linked COFs.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce ethylene (C2H4) is conducive to sustainable development of energy and environment. At present, most electrocatalysts for C2H4 production are limited to the heavy metal copper, meanwhile, achieving metal&#8208;free catalysis remains a challenge. Noted piperazine with sp3 N hybridization is beneficial to CO2 capture, but CO2RR performance and mechanism have been lacking. Herein, based on linkage engineering, we construct a novel high&#8208;density sp3 N catalytic array via introducing piperazine into the crystalline and microporous aminal&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Thanks to its high sp3 N density, strong CO2 capture capacity and great hydrophilicity, aminal&#8208;linked COF successfully achieves the conversion of CO2 to C2H4 with a Faraday efficiency up to 19.1&#8201;%, which is stand out in all reported metal&#8208;free COF electrocatalysts. In addition, a series of imine&#8208;linked COFs are synthesized and combined with DFT calculations to demonstrate the critical role of sp3 N in enhancing the kinetics of CO2RR. Therefore, this work reveals the extraordinary potential of linkage engineering in COFs to break through some catalytic bottlenecks.

         <title>Blocking Interfacial Proton Transport via Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Hydrogen Evolution&#8208;Free Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We construct a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) for HER&#8208;free zinc anodes by anchoring ionic liquid (BMIM+) cations on Ti3C2Tx (MXene) substrate. The BMIM+ with a high coordination number of water molecules can significantly reduce the interfacial densities of H2O molecules. Therefore, the SAM can disrupt the connectivity of H&#8208;bond networks and hinder proton transport at the interface, suppressing HER.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, yet suffer from the issues of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and intricate side reactions on the Zn anode surface. The hydrogen (H)&#8208;bond networks play a critical role in interfacial proton transport that may closely relate to HER but are rarely investigated. Herein, we report a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) strategy which is constructed by anchoring ionic liquid cations on Ti3C2Tx substrate for HER&#8208;free Zn anode. Molecule dynamics simulations reveal that the rationally designed SAM with a high coordination number of water molecules (25&#8211;27, 4&#8211;6 for Zn2+) largely reduces the interfacial densities of H2O molecules, therefore breaking the connectivity of H&#8208;bond networks and blocking proton transport on the interface, by which the HER is suppressed. Then, a series of in situ characterizations demonstrate that negligible amounts of H2 gas are collected from the Zn@SAM&#8208;MXene anode. Consequently, the symmetric cell enables a long&#8208;cycling life of 3000&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1000&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More significantly, the stable Zn@SAM&#8208;MXene films are successfully used for coin full cells showing high&#8208;capacity retention of over 94&#8201;% after 1000 cycles and large&#8208;area (10&#215;5&#8197;cm2) pouch cells with desired performance.

         <title>Expedient Access to 18F&#8208;Fluoroheteroarenes via Deaminative Radiofluorination of Aniline&#8208;Derived Pyridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
18F&#8208;Fluoroheteroarenes find wide application as radiotracers for PET (positron emission tomography) imaging. Here, we present a deaminative radiosynthetic approach via pyridinium tetrafluoroborates that facilitates radiofluorination of 33 structurally diverse heteroarenes in up to 98&#8201;% RCY (radiochemical yield). This method was also amenable to automation and was successfully translated to an automated synthesiser.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose that pyridinium salts derived from abundant (hetero)anilines represent a novel precursor class for nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions with [18F]fluoride. The value of this new 18F&#8208;fluorodeamination is demonstrated with the synthesis of over 30 structurally diverse and complex heteroaryl 18F&#8208;fluorides, several derived from scaffolds that were yet to be labelled with fluorine&#8208;18.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-Fluoroheteroarenes find wide application as radiotracers for PET (positron emission tomography) imaging. Here, we present a deaminative radiosynthetic approach via pyridinium tetrafluoroborates that facilitates radiofluorination of 33 structurally diverse heteroarenes in up to 98&#8201;% RCY (radiochemical yield). This method was also amenable to automation and was successfully translated to an automated synthesiser.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we disclose that pyridinium salts derived from abundant (hetero)anilines represent a novel precursor class for nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions with [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fluoride. The value of this new &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodeamination is demonstrated with the synthesis of over 30 structurally diverse and complex heteroaryl &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorides, several derived from scaffolds that were yet to be labelled with fluorine-18. The protocol tolerates heteroarenes and functionalities commonly found in drug discovery libraries, and is amenable to scale-up and automation on a commercial radiosynthesiser.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Meta&#8208;Selective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Arylation of Pyridines and Isoquinolines through Dearomatized Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meta&#8208;arylated pyridines are prepared via bench stable oxazino pyridine intermediates with unsymmetrical iodonium salts using Cu&#8208;catalysis. The strategy can be applied for meta&#8208;alkenylation upon simply switching to the corresponding alkenyl I(III) reagents and both C&#8208;H&#8208;functionalizations also work on isoquinolines.







Abstract
C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization offers an efficient strategy for the synthesis of various elaborated N&#8208;containing heteroarenes. Along these lines, oxazino pyridines that can be readily prepared from pyridines, have been introduced as powerful substrates in radical&#8208; and ionic&#8208;mediated meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization. However, the regioselective meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of pyridines remains a great challenge. Herein, a copper&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylation of pyridines and isoquinolines through bench&#8208;stable dearomatized intermediates is reported. Electrophilic aryl&#8208;Cu(III) species, generated from readily accessible aryl I(III) reagents, enable the efficient meta&#8208;arylation of a broad range of pyridines and isoquinolines. The method also allows the meta&#8208;selective alkenylation of these heteroarenes using the corresponding alkenyl I(III)&#8208;reagents. Late&#8208;stage arylation of drug&#8208;derived pyridines and larger&#8208;scale experiments demonstrate the potential of this synthetic methodology.

         <title>One&#8208;Component Cationic Lipids for Systemic mRNA Delivery to Splenic T Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike conventional four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that predominantly target the liver and possess complex constituents, we designed simplified one&#8208;component ionizable cationic lipid/mRNA nanoparticles (CLNs) for extrahepatic mRNA delivery. These CLNs facilitated mRNA expression in the spleen and T cells, demonstrating substantial potential for immunotherapy applications.







Abstract
Unlocking the full potential of mRNA immunotherapy necessitates targeted delivery to specific cell subsets in the spleen. Four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) utilized in numerous clinical trials are primarily limited in hepatocyte and muscular targeting, highlighting the imperative demand for targeted and simplified non&#8208;liver mRNA delivery systems. Herein, we report the rational design of one&#8208;component ionizable cationic lipids to selectively deliver mRNA to the spleen and T cells with high efficacy. Unlike the tertiary amine&#8208;based ionizable lipids involved in LNPs, the proposed cationic lipids rich in secondary amines can efficiently deliver mRNA both in vitro and in vivo as the standalone carriers. Furthermore, these vectors facilitate efficacious mRNA delivery to the T cell subsets following intravenous administration, demonstrating substantial potential for advancing immunotherapy applications. This straightforward strategy extends the utility of lipid family for extrahepatic mRNA delivery, offering new insights into vector development beyond LNPs to further the field of precise mRNA therapy.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancies Boosted Hydronium Intercalation: A Paradigm Shift in Aluminum&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;MoO3 nanosheets are rich in oxygen defects, which tilt the adsorption effect of Al3+ and effectively inhibit further insertion/diffusion of Al3+. This phenomenon leaves space for H3O+ insertion, allowing it to insert into the lattice smoothly.







Abstract
In aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs), the insertion/extraction chemistry of Al3+ often leads to poor kinetics, whereas the rapid diffusion kinetics of hydronium ions (H3O+) may offer the solution. However, the presence of considerable Al3+ in the electrolyte hinders the insertion reaction of H3O+. Herein, we report how oxygen&#8208;deficient &#945;&#8208;MoO3 nanosheets unlock selective H3O+ insertion in a mild aluminum&#8208;ion electrolyte. The abundant oxygen defects impede the insertion of Al3+ due to excessively strong adsorption, while allowing H3O+ to be inserted/diffused through the Grotthuss proton conduction mechanism. This research advances our understanding of the mechanism behind selective H3O+ insertion in mild electrolytes.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Inward Isomerization Hydroaminocarbonylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed inward isomerization and hydraminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic amides has been developed. The combination isomerization&#8208;responsible catalyst and hydrocarbonylation&#8208;responsible catalyst was found to be a highly effective strategy to render the reaction feasible. The reaction shows highly functional group compatibility and site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
In contrast to the kinetically favored outward isomerization&#8208;hydrocarbonylation of alkenes, the disfavored inward isomerization&#8208;hydrocarbonylation of alkenes remains an important challenge. Herein, we have developed a novel and effective palladium&#8208;catalyzed inward isomerization&#8208;hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes and aniline hydrochlorides for the formation of synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic amides in high yields and high site&#8208;selectivities. The high efficiency of the reaction is attributed to a relay catalysis strategy, in which the Markovnikov&#8208;favored [PdH]&#8208;PtBu3 catalyst is responsible for inward isomerization, while the [PdH]&#8208;Ruphos catalyst is responsible for hydroaminocarbonylation of the resulting conjugated aryl alkenes. The reaction exhibits highly functional group tolerance and provides a new method for formal carbonylation of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bond.

         <title>Enantiopure [6]&#8208;Azairidahelicene by Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of a Configurationally Labile [4]&#8208;Helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 26, June 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiopure [6]&#8208;azairidahelicenes, combining chirality at the metal center and at the helicenic fragment, are readily accessible by an effective dynamic kinetic resolution (dkr) of a configurationally labile [4]&#8208;helicenic ligand. The two isolated enantiomers exhibit perfect mirrored electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) signals.







Abstract
A pair of enantiopure [6]&#8208;azairidahelicenes incorporating chirality at the metal center and on the helicenic ligand were synthesized by dynamic kinetic resolution (dkr) of a configurationally labile [4]&#8208;helicenic ligand (4&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;benzo[g]phenanthrene, L1H) using bis&#8208;cyclometalated chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal only iridium(III) precursors as chiral inductors. The origin of the observed dkr is attributed to the different conformation and stability of diastereomeric reaction intermediates formed during the cyclometalation process. The isolated enantiomers exhibited circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP), with |gphos| values of 1.8&#215;10&#8722;3.

&lt;p&gt;A pair of enantiopure [6]-azairidahelicenes incorporating chirality at the metal center and on the helicenic ligand were synthesized by dynamic kinetic resolution (dkr) of a configurationally labile [4]-helicenic ligand (4-(2-pyridyl)-benzo[g]phenanthrene, &lt;b&gt;L1H&lt;/b&gt;) using bis-cyclometalated chiral-at-metal only iridium(III) precursors as chiral inductors. The origin of the observed dkr is attributed to the different conformation and stability of diastereomeric reaction intermediates formed during the cyclometalation process. The isolated enantiomers exhibited circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP), with |g&lt;sub&gt;phos&lt;/sub&gt;| values of 1.8&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
