         <title>Persistent ATP&#8208;Concentration Gradients in a Hydrogel sustained by Chemical Fuel Consumption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We show the formation of macroscopic ATP&#8208;concentrations in an agarose gel and demonstrate that these gradients can be sustained in time at the expense of the consumption of a chemical fuel. The approach relies on the spatially controlled activation of ATP&#8208;producing and ATP&#8208;consuming reactions through the local injection of enzymes in the matrix. The reaction&#8208;diffusion system is maintained in a stationary non&#8208;equilibrium state as long as chemical fuel, phosphocreatine, is present. The reaction&#8208;diffusion system is coupled to a supramolecular system composed of monolayer protected gold nanoparticles and a fluorescent probe. As a result of this coupling, fluorescence signals emerge spontaneously in response to the ATP&#8208;concentration gradients. We show that the approach permits the rational formation of complex fluorescence patterns that change over time as a function of the evolution of the ATP&#8208;concentrations present in the system.</dc:description>

         <title>Micromolar Affinity and Higher: Synthetic Host&#8208;Guest Complexes with High Stabilities.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of high&#8208;affinity synthetic host&#8208;guest complexes is of paramount importance because they are key elements in constructing unprecedented supramolecular assemblies, functional materials, molecular probes, artificial signal transduction events, and interfaces with the biological world. The present review article collects recent achievements in the design of 1:1 host&#8208;guest complexes with leading stabilities, i.e., exceeding 106 M&#8208;1. The relationships between the measured thermodynamic constants and the structural parameters of the interacting species are analyzed. The design features of high&#8208;affinity hosts are discussed in light of their binding properties. Different solvents and dissimilar types of noncovalent interactions are considered for the stabilization of the complexes. Finally, some hints are provided for the design of future synthetic receptors displaying high affinity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Retina&#8208;Inspired Organic Photonic Synapses for Selective Detection of SWIR Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photonic synapses with the dual function of optical signal detection and information processing can simulate human visual system. However, photonic synapses with selective detection of short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) light have never been reported, which can not only broaden the human vision region but also integrate neuromorphic computation and infrared optical communication. Here, organic photonic synapses based on a new&#160;donor&#8208;acceptor copolymer P1 are fabricated, which exhibit excellent synaptic characteristics with selective detection for SWIR and extremely low energy consumption (2.85 fJ). The working mechanism is rooted in energy level barriers and unbalanced charge transportation. Moreover, these photonic synapses demonstrate excellent performance in multi&#8208;signal logic editing, letter imaging and memory with noise reduction function. This contribution provides ideas of constructing selective&#8208;response synapses for artificial visual system and neuromorphic computing.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Disentangled Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polyethylene via Binuclear Synergic Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disentangled ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (dis&#8208;UHMWPE) has excellent processability but can be achieved under extreme conditions. Herein, we report ethylene polymerization with the binuclear half&#8208;sandwich scandium complexes C1&#8208;Sc2&#160;and C2&#8208;Sc2 to afford UHMWPE. C1&#8208;Sc2&#160;bearing a short linker shows higher activity and gives higher molecular weight PEs than C2&#8208;Sc2 containing a flexible spacer and the mononuclear Sc1. Strikingly, all UHMWPEs isolated from C1&#8208;Sc2&#160;under broad temperature range (25&#8208;120 &#176;C) and wide ethylene pressures (2&#8208;13 bars) feature very low degree of entanglement as proved by rheological test, DSC annealing study and SEM. These dis&#8208;UHMWPEs are facilely mediated solid&#8208;state&#8208;process at 130 &#176;C and their tensile strength and modulus reach up to 149.2 MPa and 1.5 GPa, respectively. DFT simulations reveal that the formation of dis&#8208;UHMWPE is attributed to the binuclear synergic effect and the agostic interaction between the active center and the growing chain.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Drugs via Alkene Formal Insertion into Benzylic C&#8208;F Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8722;F insertion of carbon&#8208;atom units is underdeveloped although it poses significant potential applications in both drug discovery and development. Herein, we report a photocatalytic protocol for late&#8208;stage modification of trifluoromethyl aromatic drugs involving formal insertion of abundant alkene feedstocks into a benzylic C&#8208;F bond selectively. This redox&#8208;neutral transformation features mild conditions and extraordinary functional group tolerance. Preliminary studies are consistent with this transformation involving a radical&#8208;polar crossover pathway. Additionally, it offers an alternative strategy for difunctionalization of alkenes via quenching of the carbocation intermediate with nucleophiles other than external fluoride.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Annealing in Adaptive Multicomponent Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We use a pH&#8208;driven annealing process to convert between co&#8208;assembled and self&#8208;sorted networks in multicomponent gels. The initially formed gels at low pH are co&#8208;assembled, with the two components coexisting within the same self&#8208;assembled structures. We use an enzymatic approach to increase the pH, resulting in a gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition, followed by a hydrolysis to lower the pH once again. As the pH decreases, a self&#8208;sorted network is formed by a two&#8208;stage gelation process determined by the pKa of each component. This approach can be expanded to layered systems to generate many varied systems by changing composition and rates of pH change, adapting their microstructure and so allowing access to a far greater range of morphologies and complexity than can be achieved in single component systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrite Electroreduction to Ammonia Promoted by Molecular Carbon Dioxide with Near&#8208;unity Faradic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of nitrite (NO2&#8722;) offers an energy&#8208;efficient route for ammonia (NH3) synthesis and reduction of the level of nitrite, which is one of the major pollutants in water. However, the near 100% Faradaic efficiency (FE) has yet to be achieved due to the complicated reduction route with several intermediates. Here, we report that carbon dioxide (CO2) can enhance the nitrite electroreduction to ammonia on copper nanowire (Cu NW) catalysts. In a broad potential range (&#8208;0.7 ~ &#8208;1.3 V vs. RHE), the FE of nitrite to ammonia is close to 100% with a 3.5&#8208;fold increase in activity compared to that obtained without CO2. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that CO2 acts as a catalyst to facilitate the *NO to *N step, which is the rate determining step for ammonia synthesis. The promotion effect of CO2 can be expanded to electroreduction of other nitro&#8208;compounds, such as nitrate to ammonia and nitrobenzene to aniline.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Hydroxylation of C&#8208;H bonds by Synergistic Use of Protein Engineering and Exogenous Dual&#8208;Functional Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is a great challenge to optionally access diverse hydroxylation products from a given substrate bearing multiple reaction sites of sp3 and sp2 C&#8208;H bonds. Herein, we report to achieve highly selective divergent hydroxylation of alkylbenzenes by an engineered P450 peroxygenase driven by a dual&#8208;functional small molecule (DFSM). Using combinations of various P450BM3 variants with DFSMs accessed more than half of all possible hydroxylated products from each substrate with excellent regioselectivity (up to &gt;99%), enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee), and high total turnover numbers (up to 80,963). Crystal structure analysis, molecular dynamic simulations, and theoretical calculations revealed that synergistic effects between exogenous DFSMs and the protein environment controlled regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This work has implications for the exogenous molecule&#8208;modulated enzymatic regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroxylation toward the potential applications in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Method to Edit Histone H3 Modifications on Chromatin Via Sortase&#8208;Mediated Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sortase&#8208;based method of histone H3 tail editing on chromatin is reported. Histone H3 tail peptides with cell&#8208;penetrating sequence can be metathesized to histone H3 for multivalent modifications on chromatin and influence epigenetics. This described sortase mediated metathesis strategy could be broadly applied to edit endogenous proteins in live cells.







Abstract
The post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) on the tail of histone H3 control chromatin structure and influence epigenetics and gene expression. The current chemical methods including unnatural amino acid incorporation and protein splicing enable preparations of the histone with diverse PTMs in cellular contexts, but they are not applicable to edit native chromatin. The manipulation of histone&#8208;modifying enzymes alter the endogenous histone PTMs but the lack of specificity of most histone&#8208;modifying enzymes prevents precise control of specific H3 tail PTM patterns. Here we report a new method to edit the N&#8208;tail of histone H3 via sortase mediated metathesis (SMM). The sortase can install desired PTM patterns into histone H3 on nucleosomes in vitro and in cellulo. This study expands the application scope of sortase from ligation to metathesis in live cells using cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs). In addition, it offers a strategy to edit PTMs of cellular histone H3 with potential for the development of precise epigenome editing.

         <title>The Electronic Origin of the Zeta Potential is Supported by the Redox Mechanism on an Aqueous Dispersion of Exfoliated Graphite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous graphite dispersion was prepared without passivating agents and a minimal amount of functional groups by treating graphite with ammonium hydroxide. This approach has raised the Fermi level above the original value. The negative zeta potential has been revisited and attributed to the electrons accumulated on the material.







Abstract
Herein we have proposed that a redox mechanism can produce surface charges and negative zeta potential on an aqueous graphite dispersion. Graphite was kept in contact with a concentrated ammonia aqueous solution, washed, and exfoliated in water, resulting in a dispersion with lyophobic nature. Ammonia treatment did not provide functional groups or nitrogen doping to graphite. Moreover, this material was washed twice before sonication to remove most hydroxide. Therefore, neither functional groups, nitrogen atoms, nor hydroxide excess is responsible for the zeta potential. Kelvin probe force microscopy has shown that the ammonia&#8208;treated and exfoliated graphite has higher Fermi level than the water&#8208;treated material, indicating that the contact between ammonia and graphite promotes redox reactions that provide electrons to graphite. These electrons raise the Fermi level of graphite and generate the negative zeta potential, consequently, they account for the colloidal stability.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Spatiotemporal Probing of Neurochemical Events by Advanced Electrochemical Sensing Methods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced electrochemical sensing has greatly increased the amount of information available on neurochemical events at all spatiotemporal dimensionalities. This Minireview highlights the latest progress on the individualized electrochemical description of vesicle properties and chemical content, single&#8208;cell monitoring of transient exocytotic release, in vivo selective amperometric sensing of neurochemical dynamics, and concurrent recording of multiple brain signals.







Abstract
Neurochemical events involving biosignals of different time and space dimensionalities constitute the complex basis of neurological functions and diseases. In view of this fact, electrochemical measurements enabling real&#8208;time quantification of neurochemicals at multiple levels of spatiotemporal resolution can provide informative clues to decode the molecular networks bridging vesicles and brains. This Minireview focuses on how scientific questions regarding the properties of single vesicles, neurotransmitter release kinetics, interstitial neurochemical dynamics, and multisignal interconnections in vivo have driven the design of electrochemical nano/microsensors, sensing interface engineering, and signal/data processing. An outlook for the future frontline in this realm will also be provided.

         <title>One&#8208;Shot Synthesis of B/N&#8208;Doped Calix[4]arene Exhibiting Narrowband Multiple Resonance Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped calix[4]arene named C&#8208;BN was successfully synthesized through one&#8208;shot double borylation. C&#8208;BN shows a highly centrosymmetric structure with two multiple resonance fragments bridged by tertiary amine groups at the 1,3 positions of the benzene ring. The optimized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes can exhibit high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 24.7&#8211;26.6&#8201;% and small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;max of 25&#8211;28&#8197;nm over a wide doping range of 1&#8211;12&#8197;wt&#8201;%.







Abstract
A novel macrocycle of B/N&#8208;doped calix[4]arene (C&#8208;BN) was synthesized by a one&#8208;shot double boronation. Owing to the structural tension and electron&#8208;donating properties of the nitrogen atoms in the macrocycle, reaction selectively proceeds between the adjacent benzene rings outside the macrocycle. C&#8208;BN shows a highly centrosymmetric structure with two multiple resonance (MR) fragments bridged by tertiary amine groups at the 1,3 positions of the benzene ring. Benefiting from the large intermolecular distance (&gt;4.6&#8197;&#197;) between adjacent MR&#8208;emitting cores, C&#8208;BN also exhibits excellent narrowband emitting features against aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and spectrum broadening. Optimized organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices based on C&#8208;BN exhibit high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 24.7&#8211;26.6&#8201;% and small full width at half maximums of 25&#8211;28&#8197;nm over a wide doping range of 1&#8211;12&#8197;wt&#8201;%.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled Ru(bda) Coordination Oligomers as Efficient Catalysts for Visible Light&#8208;Driven Water Oxidation in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble Ru(bda) coordination oligomers with varying lengths are investigated in visible light&#8208;driven water oxidation catalysis. The excellent performance and stability of longer oligomers in pure water is rationalized by the very high local concentrations of active sites in self&#8208;assembled superstructures.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble multinuclear complexes based on ruthenium 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate (bda) and ditopic bipyridine linker units are investigated in three&#8208;component visible light&#8208;driven water oxidation catalysis. Systematic studies revealed a strong enhancement of the catalytic efficiency in the absence of organic co&#8208;solvents and with increasing oligomer length. In&#8208;depth kinetic and morphological investigations suggest that the enhanced performance is induced by the self&#8208;assembly of linear Ru(bda) oligomers into aggregated superstructures. The obtained turnover frequencies (up to 14.9&#8197;s&#8722;1) and turnover numbers (more than 1000) per ruthenium center are the highest reported so far for Ru(bda)&#8208;based photocatalytic water oxidation systems.

     alt="Self-assembled Ru(bda) Coordination Oligomers as Efficient Catalysts for Visible Light-Driven Water Oxidation in Pure Water"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water-soluble Ru(bda) coordination oligomers with varying lengths are investigated in visible light-driven water oxidation catalysis. The excellent performance and stability of longer oligomers in pure water is rationalized by the very high local concentrations of active sites in self-assembled superstructures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water-soluble multinuclear complexes based on ruthenium 2,2&#8242;-bipyridine-6,6&#8242;-dicarboxylate (bda) and ditopic bipyridine linker units are investigated in three-component visible light-driven water oxidation catalysis. Systematic studies revealed a strong enhancement of the catalytic efficiency in the absence of organic co-solvents and with increasing oligomer length. In-depth kinetic and morphological investigations suggest that the enhanced performance is induced by the self-assembly of linear Ru(bda) oligomers into aggregated superstructures. The obtained turnover frequencies (up to 14.9&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and turnover numbers (more than 1000) per ruthenium center are the highest reported so far for Ru(bda)-based photocatalytic water oxidation systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling Selectivity in Plasmonic Catalysis: Switching Reaction Pathway from Hydrogenation to Homocoupling Under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmonic catalysis enables the use of light to accelerate molecular transformations. Its application to the control reaction selectivity is highly attractive but remains challenging. Here, we have found that the plasmonic properties in AgPd nanoparticles allowed different reaction pathways for tunable product formation under visible light irradiation. By employing the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene as a model transformation, we demonstrate that visible light irradiation can be employed to steer the reaction pathway from hydrogenation to homocoupling. Our data showed that the decrease in the concentration of H species at the surface due to plasmon&#8208;enhanced H2 desorption led to the control in selectivity. These results provide important insights into the understanding of reaction selectivity with light, paving the way for the application of plasmonic catalysis to the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diynes, and bringing the vision of light&#8208;driven transformations with target selectivity one step closer to reality.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Triaryl &#945;&#8208;Pyranones with 1,2&#8208;Diaxes by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;step atroposelective construction of stereogenic 1,2&#8208;diaxes of triaryl &#945;&#8208;pyranones was accomplished by NHC organocatalysis. The structure of the substrates and the catalytic system play a critical role in the success of this protocol. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the origin of the high stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Atropisomers bearing multiple stereogenic axes are of increasing importance to the field of material science, pharmaceuticals, and catalysis. However, the atroposelective construction of multi&#8208;axis atropisomers remains rare and challenging, due to the intrinsical difficulties in the stereo&#8208;control of the multiple stereogenic axes. Herein, we demonstrate a single&#8208;step construction of a new class of 1,2&#8208;diaxially chiral triaryl &#945;&#8208;pyranones by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene organocatalytic asymmetric [3+3] annulation of well&#8208;designed alkynyl acylazolium precursors and enolizable sterically hindered 2&#8208;aryl ketones. The protocol features broad substrate scope (&gt;50 examples), excellent stereo&#8208;control (most cases &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, up to 99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 er), and potentially useful synthetic applications. The success of this reaction relies on the rational design of structurally matched reaction partners and the careful selection of the asymmetric catalytic system. DFT calculations have also been performed to discover and rationalize the origin of the high stereoselectivity of this reaction.

         <title>Access to N&#8722;CF3 Formamides by Reduction of N&#8722;CF3 Carbamoyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthetic access to N&#8208;trifluoromethylated formamides is reported. The method involves the reduction of bench&#8208;stable N&#8722;CF3 carbamoyl fluorides. In contrast to e.g. N&#8722;Me formamides, the newly made N&#8722;CF3 formamides do not show rotamers at room temperature. Moreover, they are highly robust and compatible with diverse chemical transformations.







Abstract
The departure into unknown chemical space is essential for the discovery of new properties and function. We herein report the first synthetic access to N&#8208;trifluoromethylated formamides. The method involves the reduction of bench&#8208;stable NCF3 carbamoyl fluorides and is characterized by operational simplicity and mildness, tolerating a broad range of functional groups as well as stereocenters. The newly made N&#8722;CF3 formamide motif proved to be highly robust and compatible with diverse chemical transformations, underscoring its potential as building block in complex functional molecules.

         <title>Organizing Enzymes on Self&#8208;Assembled Protein Cages for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled protein cages were functionalized to achieve spatial organization of sequential enzymes in living cells, which confer cascade reactions with optimal local concentrations and microenvironment, thereby entailing enhanced biocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Cells use self&#8208;assembled biomaterials such as lipid membranes or proteinaceous shells to coordinate thousands of reactions that simultaneously take place within crowded spaces. However, mimicking such spatial organization for synthetic applications in engineered systems remains a challenge, resulting in inferior catalytic efficiency. In this work, we show that protein cages as an ideal scaffold to organize enzymes to enhance cascade reactions both in vitro and in living cells. We demonstrate that not only enzyme&#8208;enzyme distance but also the improved Km value contribute to the enhanced reaction rate of cascade reactions. Three sequential enzymes for lycopene biosynthesis have been co&#8208;localized on the exterior of the engineered protein cages in Escherichia coli, leading to an 8.5&#8208;fold increase of lycopene production by streamlining metabolic flux towards its biosynthesis. This versatile system offers a powerful tool to achieve enzyme spatial organization for broad applications in biocatalysis.

         <title>Selective Synthesis of Oligosaccharides by Mechanochemical Hydrolysis of Chitin over a Carbon&#8208;Based Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activated carbon catalyst having weak acid sites hydrolyzes chitin to chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides selectively in the presence of mechanical milling. Our system preferentially cleaves large molecules over small oligomers, thus maximizing the selectivity and yield of chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides. The product mixture is a promising plant biostimulant for environmentally friendly agriculture.







Abstract
Oligosaccharides possess fascinating functions that are applicable in a variety of fields, such as agriculture. However, the selective synthesis of oligosaccharides, especially chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides, has remained a challenge. Chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides activate the plant immune system, enabling crops to withstand pathogens without harmful agrichemicals. Here, we demonstrate the conversion of chitin to chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides using a carbon catalyst with weak acid sites and mechanical milling. The catalyst produces chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides with up to 94&#8201;% selectivity in good yields. Monte&#8208;Carlo simulations indicate that our system preferentially hydrolyzes larger chitin molecules over oligomers, thus providing the desired high selectivity. This unique kinetics is in contrast to the fact that typical catalytic systems rapidly hydrolyze oligomers to monomers. Unlike other materials carbons more strongly adsorb large polysaccharides than small oligomers, which is suitable for the selective synthesis of small oligosaccharides.

         <title>Highly Efficient Green and Red Narrowband Emissive Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Employing Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters
</title>

         <dc:description>
Through careful selection of donor substituents about the DiKTa core, record&#8208;high efficiency green&#8208;emitting OLEDs were fabricated, with EQEmax of 30.8&#8201;%, and the reddest MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs have been reported based on ketone&#8208;containing multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate how judicious selection of the donor decorating a central multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) core based on DiKTa can lead to very high&#8208;performance OLEDs. By decorating the DiKTa core with triphenylamine (TPA) and diphenylamine (DPA), 3TPA&#8208;DiKTa and 3DPA&#8208;DiKTa exhibit bright, narrowband green and red emission in doped films, respectively. The OLEDs based on these emitters showed record&#8208;high performance for this family of emitters with maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax) of 30.8&#8201;% for 3TPA&#8208;DiKTa at &#955;EL of 551&#8197;nm and 16.7&#8201;% for 3DPA&#8208;DiKTa at &#955;EL=613&#8197;nm. The efficiency roll&#8208;off in the OLEDs was improved significantly by using 4CzIPN as an assistant dopant in hyperfluorescence (HF) devices. The outstanding device performance has been attributed to preferential horizontal orientation of the transition dipole moments of 3TPA&#8208;DiKTa and 3DPA&#8208;DiKTa.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Devices Enabled by a Polyfullerene Electron Transporting Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyfullerene material (PFBS&#8208;C12) is developed that can work efficiently as the electron transporting material of p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs). PFBS&#8208;C12 retains the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits of conventional fullerene molecules, and shows suppressed aggregation and more conformal coverage on perovskites compared to PCBM. As a result, the p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs based on PFBS&#8208;C12 realize a high efficiency of 23.2&#8201;% with good device stability.







Abstract
Electron transporting materials (ETMs) play vital roles in determining the efficiency and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells. The widely used PCBM is prone to undesirable aggregation and migration in a cell, thus impairing device stability. In this work, we develop a new type of ETMs by polymerizing C60 fullerene with an aromantic linker unit. The resultant polyfullerene (PFBS&#8208;C12) not only maintains the good optoelectronic properties of fullerenes, but also can address the aforementioned aggregation problem of PCBM. The polyfullerene&#8208;based blade&#8208;coated cells exhibit a high efficiency of 23.2&#8201;% and good device stability that maintain 96&#8201;% of initial efficiency after &gt;1300&#8208;hour light soaking. An aperture efficiency of 18.9&#8201;% is also achieved on a 53.6&#8208;cm2 perovskite mini&#8208;module. This work provides a new strategy for designing ETMs that retain the key figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits of conventional fullerene molecules and enable more stable perovskite solar devices simultaneously.

         <title>Recent Advances in Hybrid Materials of Metal Nanoparticles and Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid materials that consist of metal nanoparticles and polyoxometalates have enormous potential in a multitude of applications, including electrochemistry, photochemistry, catalysis, biochemistry, and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). This Minireview highlights recent advances in this area, covering synthesis and applications as well as highlighting current limitations and future research opportunities.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs), anionic metal&#8208;oxygen nanoclusters that possess various composition&#8208;dependent properties, are widely used to modify the existing properties of metal nanoparticles and to endow them with new ones. Herein, we present an overview of recent advances in hybrid materials that consist of metal nanoparticles and POMs. Following a brief introduction on the inception of this area and its development, representative properties and applications of these materials in various fields such as electrochemistry, photochemistry, and catalysis are introduced. We discuss how the combination of two classic inorganic materials facilitates cooperative and synergistic behavior, and we also give personal perspectives on the future development of this field.

         <title>An RNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Structure within the ADAR 5&#8242;UTR Interacts with DHX36 Helicase to Regulate Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (rG4) structure was identified in the 5&#8242;UTR of the ADAR1 mRNA using multi&#8208;disciplinary assays in vitro and cells. The binding and resolving effect of rG4&#8208;specific helicase DHX36 on this rG4 was monitored using G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;triggered fluorogenic hybridization (GTFH) probe. Functionally, ADAR1 5&#8242;UTR rG4 inhibits reporter gene and native transcript translation with DHX36 modulating its formation in cells.







Abstract
RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (rG4) structures in the 5&#8242; untranslated region (5&#8242;UTR) play crucial roles in fundamental cellular processes. ADAR is an important enzyme that binds to double&#8208;strand RNA and accounts for the conversion of Adenosine to Inosine in RNA editing. However, so far there is no report on the formation and regulatory role of rG4 on ADAR expression. Here, we identify and characterize a thermostable rG4 structure within the 5&#8242;UTR of the ADAR1 mRNA and demonstrate its formation and inhibitory role on translation in reporter gene and native gene constructs. We reveal rG4&#8208;specific helicase DHX36 interacts with this rG4 in vitro and in cells under knockdown and knockout conditions by GTFH (G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;triggered fluorogenic hybridization) probes and modulates translation in an rG4&#8208;dependent manner. Our results further substantiate the rG4 structure&#8208;DHX36 protein interaction in cells and highlight rG4 to be a key player in controlling ADAR1 translation.

         <title>Native Amide&#8208;Directed C(sp3)&#8722;H Amidation Enabled by Electron&#8208;Deficient RhIII Catalyst and Electron&#8208;Deficient 2&#8208;Pyridone Ligand</title>

Direct C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reactions of native amides can facilitate streamlined synthesis of valuable molecules, but their insufficient directing ability is one of the current severe challenges of the field. Here we report that the combination of an electron&#8208;deficient RhIII catalyst and an electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand shows high catalytic activity for C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation of various native amides.







Abstract
Trivalent group&#8208;9 metal catalysts with a cyclopentadienyl&#8208;type ligand (CpMIII; M=Co, Rh, Ir, Cp=cyclopentadienyl) have been widely used for directed C&#8722;H functionalizations, albeit that their application to challenging C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalizations suffers from the limitations of the available directing groups. In this report, we describe directed C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation reactions of simple amide substrates with a variety of substituents. The combination of an electron&#8208;deficient CpERh catalyst (CpE=1,3&#8208;bis(ethoxycarbonyl)&#8208;substituted Cp) and an electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand is essential for high reactivity.

         <title>Catalytic Biosensors Operating under Quasi&#8208;Equilibrium Conditions for Mitigating the Changes in Substrate Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a catalytic quasi&#8208;equilibrium biosensor concept in which an O2&#8208;insensitive enzyme is wired with a redox polymer to the electrode. This allows the enzymatic conversion to be switched off by applying a low potential, the redox polymer can be charged with a short positive potential pulse, and the glucose concentration can be determined potentiometrically with minimal disturbance of the concentration equilibrium. This concept is opening the door for mitigating any impact of the foreign&#8208;body reaction in implantable biosensors.







Abstract
Despite the success of continuous glucose measuring systems operating through the skin for about 14&#8197;days, long&#8208;term implantable biosensors are facing challenges caused by the foreign&#8208;body reaction. We present a conceptually new strategy using catalytic enzyme&#8208;based biosensors based on a measuring sequence leading to minimum disturbance of the substrate equilibrium concentration by controlling the sensor between &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221; state combined with short potentiometric data acquisition. It is required that the enzyme activity can be completely switched off and no parasitic side reactions allow substrate turnover. This is achieved by using an O2&#8208;independent FAD&#8208;dependent glucose dehydrogenase embedded within a crosslinked redox polymer. A short measuring interval allows the glucose concentration equilibrium to be restored quickly which enables the biosensor to operate under quasi&#8208;equilibrium conditions.

         <title>Precisely Tailoring Heterometallic Polyoxotitanium Clusters for the Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterometallic cocrystal Ti4Fe1 cluster is prepared by incorporating Fe species into a polyoxotitanium cluster. The cocrystal Ti4Fe1 cluster enables both C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation by photogenerated holes and further reactions by singlet oxygen. As a result Ti4Fe1 has higher activity and selectivity in the photocatalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons than the Fe&#8208;doped Ti3Fe1 cluster.







Abstract
Photocatalysis is a promising yet challenging approach for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons to valuable oxygenated chemicals with O2 under mild conditions. In this work, we report an atomically precise material model to address this challenge. The key to our solution is the rational incorporation of Fe species into polyoxotitanium cluster to form a heterometallic Ti4Fe1 cocrystal. This newly designed cocrystal cluster, which well governs the energy and charge transfer as evidenced by spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations, enables the synergistic process involving C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation by photogenerated holes and further reactions by singlet oxygen (1O2). Remarkably, the cocrystal Ti4Fe1 cluster achieves efficient and selective oxidation of hydrocarbons (C5 to C16) into aldehydes and ketones with a conversion rate up to 12&#8201;860&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, 5 times higher than that of Fe&#8208;doped Ti3Fe1 cluster. This work provides insights into photocatalyst design at atomic level enabling synergistic catalysis.

         <title>Conversion of a AuI Fluorido Complex into an N&#8208;Fluoroamido Derivative: N&#8722;F versus Au&#8722;N Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of a fluoroamido complex was achieved on reaction of [Au(F)(SPhos)] with NFSI. Reactivity studies revealed the insertion of CO into the N&#8722;F bond. The transfer of the fluoroamido group onto organic molecules was also accomplished.







Abstract
The AuI complex [Au{N(F)SO2Ph}(SPhos)] (SPhos=dicyclohexyl(2&#8242;,6&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxy[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphane) (2) bearing a fluoroamido ligand has been synthesized by reaction of the fluorido complex [Au(F)(SPhos)] (1) with NFSI (NFSI=N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide). A reaction with CO resulted in an unprecedented insertion into the N&#8722;F bond at 2. With the carbene precursor N2CH(CO2Et) N&#8722;F bond cleavage gave the Au&#8722;F bond insertion product [Au{CHF(CO2C2H5)}(SPhos)] (7). The presence of CNtBu led to Au&#8722;N cleavage at 2 and concomitant amide formation to give the cationic complex [Au(CNtBu)(SPhos)][N(F)SO2Ph)] (5), which reacted further to give FtBu as well as the cyanido complex [Au(CN)(SPhos)] (6). These results led to the development of a process for the amination of electrophilic organic substrates by transfer of the fluoroamido group NF(SO2Ph)&#8722;.

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Computational Design of &#969;&#8208;Transaminase by Reprograming of High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Barrier Steps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanism&#8208;guided computational enzyme design was used to reprogram the transition states and ground states of key steps in the asymmetric reductive amination of indanones. The common features of three high&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier steps responsible for low catalytic efficiency were revealed by quantum mechanics and guided subsequent enzyme design. The best mutant exhibited a significant improvement in catalytic efficiency towards various prochiral indanones.







Abstract
&#969;&#8208;Transaminases (&#969;&#8208;TAs) show considerable potential for the synthesis of chiral amines. However, their low catalytic efficiency towards bulky substrates limits their application, and complicated catalytic mechanisms prevent precise enzyme design. Herein, we address this challenge using a mechanism&#8208;guided computational enzyme design strategy by reprograming the transition and ground states in key reaction steps. The common features among the three high&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier steps responsible for the low catalytic efficiency were revealed using quantum mechanics (QM). Five key residues were simultaneously tailored to stabilize the rate&#8208;limiting transition state with the aid of the Rosetta design. The 14 top&#8208;ranked variants showed 16.9&#8211;143&#8208;fold improved catalytic activity. The catalytic efficiency of the best variant, M9 (Q25F/M60W/W64F/I266A), was significantly increased, with a 1660&#8208;fold increase in kcat/Km and a 1.5&#8211;26.8&#8208;fold increase in turnover number (TON) towards various indanone derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;&#969;-Transaminases (&#969;-TAs) show considerable potential for the synthesis of chiral amines. However, their low catalytic efficiency towards bulky substrates limits their application, and complicated catalytic mechanisms prevent precise enzyme design. Herein, we address this challenge using a mechanism-guided computational enzyme design strategy by reprograming the transition and ground states in key reaction steps. The common features among the three high-energy-barrier steps responsible for the low catalytic efficiency were revealed using quantum mechanics (QM). Five key residues were simultaneously tailored to stabilize the rate-limiting transition state with the aid of the Rosetta design. The 14 top-ranked variants showed 16.9&#8211;143-fold improved catalytic activity. The catalytic efficiency of the best variant, M9 (Q25F/M60W/W64F/I266A), was significantly increased, with a 1660-fold increase in &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and a 1.5&#8211;26.8-fold increase in turnover number (TON) towards various indanone derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conversion of Polyethylenes into Fungal Secondary Metabolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed plastics were collected from Catalina Harbor on Catalina Island, CA. After sorting, polyethylenes were catalytically degraded into carboxylic diacids. These diacids are then upgraded by engineered strains of Aspergillus nidulans into structurally diverse secondary metabolites. Phase contrast micrographs show ample asperbenzaldehyde crystals in liquid culture medium containing polyethylene digest.







Abstract
Waste plastics represent major environmental and economic burdens due to their ubiquity, slow breakdown rates, and inadequacy of current recycling routes. Polyethylenes are particularly problematic, because they lack robust recycling approaches despite being the most abundant plastics in use today. We report a novel chemical and biological approach for the rapid conversion of polyethylenes into structurally complex and pharmacologically active compounds. We present conditions for aerobic, catalytic digestion of polyethylenes collected from post&#8208;consumer and oceanic waste streams, creating carboxylic diacids that can then be used as a carbon source by the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. As a proof of principle, we have engineered strains of A. nidulans to synthesize the fungal secondary metabolites asperbenzaldehyde, citreoviridin, and mutilin when grown on these digestion products. This hybrid approach considerably expands the range of products to which polyethylenes can be upcycled.

         <title>2D Hexagonal Assemblies of Amphiphilic Double&#8208;Helical Poly(phenylacetylene) Homopolymers with Enhanced Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique assembly strategy has been developed to generate free&#8208;standing two&#8208;dimensional chiral nanomaterials based on amphiphilic poly(phenylacetylene) homopolymers, which bear hydrophobic and hydrophilic dendritic side chains and adopt a DNA&#8208;like double&#8208;helical conformation. The aggregates form modulable 2D hexagonal nanosheets directly in solution, with enhanced CPL and chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) chiral materials have been attracting immense attentions owing to their unique properties. Herein, we successfully developed a unique assembly strategy of amphiphilic homopolymers to construct stable free&#8208;standing 2D chiral nanosheets in solution. The amphiphilic poly(phenylacetylene) (PPA) homopolymers bearing the hydrophobic and hydrophilic dendritic side chains adopt a DNA&#8208;like double&#8208;helical conformation. The regular hexagonal nanosheets were formed in THF/EtOH through nucleation and epitaxial growth. The sizes of the nanosheets can be modulated from nanometers to submillimeters upon varying the ratio of binary solvents, while the thickness is linearly correlated with the molecular weights. The 2D architecture can significantly enhance the CPL of polymers with a high dissymmetry factor &#8776;0.1. Driven by a discrimination of helical conformation, the PPAs can self&#8208;sort into homochiral 2D nanosheets, as directly visualized by using fluorescent microscopy.

         <title>Near&#8208;Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetoelectric Coupling via Spin Crossover in an Iron(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetoelectric coupling is achieved near room temperature in a spin crossover FeII molecule&#8208;based compound. The coupling is realized through the interplay of structural, magnetic, and electrical changes that allows the spin crossover to be driven by a remarkably low magnetic field of 3&#8197;T.







Abstract
Magnetoelectric coupling is achieved near room temperature in a spin crossover FeII molecule&#8208;based compound, [Fe(1bpp)2](BF4)2. Large atomic displacements resulting from Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions induce a change in the molecule dipole moment when switching between high&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin states leading to a step&#8208;wise change in the electric polarization and dielectric constant. For temperatures in the region of bistability, the changes in magnetic and electrical properties are induced with a remarkably low magnetic field of 3&#8197;T. This result represents a successful expansion of magnetoelectric spin crossovers towards ambient conditions. Moreover, the observed 0.3&#8211;0.4&#8197;mC&#8201;m&#8722;2 changes in the H&#8208;induced electric polarization suggest that the high strength of the coupling obtained via this route is accessible not just at cryogenic temperatures but also near room temperature, a feature that is especially appealing in the light of practical applications.

Abstract
In this work, the development of exo&#8208;olefin compounds (R&#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Z) as chain&#8208;transfer agents for the sulfur&#8208;free reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) radical polymerization of methacrylates in homogeneous solution is described. A series of exo&#8208;olefin compounds with a methyl methacrylate (MMA) dimer structure as the R group and a substituted &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene unit as the &#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Z (Z: Ph&#8722;Y) group were synthesized and used for the radical polymerization of MMA in toluene and PhC(CF3)2OH. These compounds underwent transfer of the CH2C(=CH2)Z group via addition&#8208;fragmentation of the propagating methacryloyl radical. More electron&#8208;donating (Y) substituents, such as methoxy and dimethylamino groups, produced polymers with narrower molecular weight distributions. A continuous monomer addition method further improved molecular weight control and enabled the synthesis of colorless, sulfur&#8208;free, multiblock copolymers of methacrylates in homogeneous solutions.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperativity to Assemble a Neutral and Terminal Niobium Phosphorus Triple Bond (Nb&#8801;P)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus atom transfer from [PCO]&#8722; to the NbIV precursor [(PNP)NbCl2(NtBuAr)] (PNP=N[2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl]2&#8722;; Ar=3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3) resulted in decarbonylation and coupling of the P&#8208;atom to give [(PNPP)NbCl(NtBuAr)]. Reduction by one electron afforded the first neutral and terminal phosphido ligand on Nb, and two electron oxidation reformed the P&#8722;P bond. Computational studies were conducted to understand the mechanism in these set of transformations.







Abstract
Decarbonylation along with P&#8208;atom transfer from the phosphaethynolate anion, PCO&#8722;, to the NbIV complex [(PNP)NbCl2(NtBuAr)] (1) (PNP=N[2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl]2&#8722;; Ar=3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3) results in its coupling with one of the phosphine arms of the pincer ligand to produce a phosphanylidene phosphorane complex [(PNPP)NbCl(NtBuAr)] (2). Reduction of 2 with CoCp*2 cleaves the P&#8722;P bond to form the first neutral and terminal phosphido complex of a group 5 transition metal, namely, [(PNP)Nb&#8801;P(NtBuAr)] (3). Theoretical studies have been used to understand both the coupling of the P&#8208;atom and the reductive cleavage of the P&#8722;P bond. Reaction of 3 with a two&#8208;electron oxidant such as ethylene sulfide results in a diamagnetic sulfido complex having a P&#8722;P coupled ligand, namely [(PNPP)Nb=S(NtBuAr)] (4).

         <title>Superior Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Activation with Dimethyl Ether</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid dimethyl ether is shown to be a potent activating solvent for MOFs. The combination of low surface tension, high volatility, and coordinating ability allows efficient activation of even MOFs with coordinatively unsaturated sites. The broad applicability of the technique is demonstrated, and the level of activation achievable compares very favorably against existing activation protocols.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are demonstrated to be readily activated by treatment with the low surface tension, low boiling point solvent dimethyl ether (DME). The mildness of the method enables access to high surface areas by avoiding structural changes in the framework that often plague thermal activation methods. A distinction from previous methods is that DME activation succeeds for materials with coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) and non&#8208;CUS MOFs as well. DME displaces solvent molecules occupying the pores of the MOF as well as those coordinated to metal centers; reducing evacuation temperature by using a coordinating, yet highly volatile guest enables low temperature activation with structural retention as demonstrated surface area measurements that match or exceed existing activation protocols.

         <title>Wacker Oxidation of Methylenecyclobutanes: Scope and Selectivity in an Unusual Setting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methylenecyclobutanes are found to undergo Wacker oxidation via a semi&#8208;pinacol&#8208;type rearrangement. Key to a successful process is the use of tert&#8208;butyl nitrite as oxidant, which not only enables efficient catalyst turn&#8208;over but also ensures high Markovnikov&#8208;selectivity under mild conditions. Thus, cyclo&#173;pentan&#173;ones (26 examples) can be accessed in an overall good yield and excellent selectivity (up to 97% yield, generally &gt;99:1 ketone:aldehyde ratio). Stereochemical analysis of the reaction sequence reveals migration aptitudes in line with related 1,2&#8208;shifts. By introducing a pyox ligand to palladium, prochiral methylenecyclobutanes can be desymmetrized, thus realizing the first enantioselective Wacker oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;trivial Contribution of Carbon Hybridization in Carbon&#8208;based Substrates to Electrocatalytic Activities in Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Appling an electrochemical catalyst is an efficient strategy for inhibiting the shuttle effect and enhancing the S utilization of Li&#8208;S batteries. Carbon&#8208;based materials are the most common conductive agents and catalyst supports used in Li&#8208;S batteries, but the correlation between the diversity of hybridizations and sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) catalytic activity remains unclear. Here, by establishing two forms of carbon models, i.e., graphitic carbon (GC) and amorphous carbon (AC), we observe that the nitrogen atom doped in the GC possesses a higher local charge density and a lower Gibbs free energy towards the formation of polysulfides than in the AC. And the GC&#8208;based electrode consistently inherits considerably enhanced SRR kinetics and superior cycling stability and rate capability in Li&#8208;S batteries. Therefore, the function of carbon in Li&#8208;S batteries is not only limited as conductive support but also plays an unignorable contribution to the electrocatalytic activities of SRR.</dc:description>

However, the increasing demands of environmental protection have put forward new and strict requirements for the sustainability of aerogels.

The obtained wood&#8208;inspired aerogel has channel structure similar to that of natural wood, endowing it with superior thermal insulation properties to most existing commercial sponges. In addition, remarkable fire retardancy and complete biodegradability are integrated. With the above outstanding performances, this sustainable wood&#8208;inspired aerogel will be an ideal substitute for the existing commercial thermal insulation materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of the Chlorination of Lithium Argyrodites on the Electrolyte/Cathode Interface in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium argyrodite&#8208;type electrolytes are regarded as promising electrolytes due to their high ionic conductivity and good processability. Chemical modifications to increase ionic conductivity have already been demonstrated, but the influence of these modifications on interfacial stability remains so far unknown. In this work, we study Li  6  PS  5  Cl and Li  5.5  PS  4.5  Cl  1.5  to investigate the influence of halogenation on the electrochemical decomposition of the solid electrolyte and the chemical degradation mechanism at the cathode interface in depth. Electrochemical measurements, gas analysis and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry indicate that the Li  5.5  PS  4.5  Cl  1.5  shows pronounced electrochemical decomposition at lower potentials. The chemical reaction at higher voltages leads to more gaseous degradation products, but a lower fraction of solid oxygenated phosphorous and sulfur species. This in turn leads to a decreased interfacial resistance and thus a higher cell performance.</dc:description>

This in turn leads to a decreased interfacial resistance and thus a higher cell performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Translation of Different mRNAs in Cells via Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Photouncaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 5&#8242; cap is a hallmark of eukaryotic mRNA involved in the initiation of translation. Its modification with a single photo&#8208;cleavable group can bring translation of mRNA under the control of light. However, UV irradiation causes cell stress and downregulation of translation. Furthermore, complex processes often involve timed expression of more than one gene. The approach would thus greatly benefit from the ability to photo&#8208;cleave by blue light and to control more than one mRNA at a time. We report the synthesis of a 5&#8242; cap modified with a 7&#8208;(diethylamino)coumarin (CouCap) and adapted conditions for in vitro transcription. Translation of the resulting CouCap&#8208;mRNA is muted in vitro and in mammalian cells, and can be initiated by irradiation with 450 nm. The native cap is restored and no non&#8208;natural residues nor sequence alterations remain in the mRNA. Multiplexing for two different mRNAs was achieved by combining cap analogs with coumarin&#8208; and ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;based photo&#8208;cleavable groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Excitonic Networks Directed by DNA Templates as an Efficient Model Light&#8208;Harvesting and Energy Transfer System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional excitonic networks were assembled using wireframe DNA nanostructures as templates to direct the formation of cyanine dye aggregates. The interconnected networks with programmable sizes and geometries present strongly coupled excitonic features and have been shown to mediate long&#8208;range exciton migration up to 100&#215;100&#8197;nm for efficient photon capture and energy transfer.







Abstract
Photosynthetic organisms organize discrete light&#8208;harvesting complexes into large&#8208;scale networks to facilitate efficient light collection and utilization. Inspired by nature, herein, synthetic DNA templates were used to direct the formation of dye aggregates with a cyanine dye, K21, into discrete branched photonic complexes, and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) excitonic networks. The DNA templates ranged from four&#8208;arm DNA tiles, &#8776;10&#8197;nm in each arm, to 2D wireframe DNA origami nanostructures with different geometries and varying dimensions up to 100&#215;100&#8197;nm. These DNA&#8208;templated dye aggregates presented strongly coupled spectral features and delocalized exciton characteristics, enabling efficient photon collection and energy transfer. Compared to the discrete branched photonic systems templated on individual DNA tiles, the interconnected excitonic networks showed approximately a 2&#8208;fold increase in energy transfer efficiency. This bottom&#8208;up assembly strategy paves the way to create 2D excitonic systems with complex geometries and engineered energy pathways.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unified strategy for the deoxygenative or desulfurative pyridylation of various alcohols and thiols was developed through SET of FLPs derived from pyridinium salts and PtBu3.

Abstract
A unified strategy for the deoxygenative or desulfurative pyridylation of various alcohols and thiols has been developed through a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) derived from pyridinium salts and PtBu3. Mechanistic studies revealed that N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts serve as effective Lewis acids for the formation of FLPs with PtBu3, and the generated phosphine radical cation ionically couples with the in situ generated xanthate, eventually affording the alkyl radical through facile &#946;&#8208;scission under photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions. The reaction efficiency was further accelerated by visible&#8208;light irradiation. This method is conceptually appealing by using encounter complexes in FLP chemistry to promote SET, which provides a previously unrecognized opportunity for the selective heteroarylation of a diverse range of alcohols and thiols with various functional groups, even in complex settings under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>On&#8208;off&#8208;on Control of Molecular Inversion Symmetry via Multi&#8208;stage Protonation: Elucidating Vibronic Laporte Rule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Laporte selection rule dictates that inversion&#8208;symmetric molecules have alternately forbidden one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon electronic transitions, although in reality, vibronic interactions often interfere with applying this principle. Using single&#8208; and double&#8208;protonation to break and reconstitute inversion symmetry of a single chromophore, we can model these vibronic interactions, and demonstrate two&#8208;photon absorption switching via the Laporte rule.







Abstract
The Laporte rule dictates that one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon absorption spectra of inversion&#8208;symmetric molecules should display alternatively forbidden electronic transitions; however, for organic fluorophores, drawing clear distinction between the symmetric&#8208; and non&#8208;inversion symmetric two&#8208;photon spectra is often obscured due to prevalent vibronic interactions. We take advantage of consecutive single&#8208; and double&#8208;protonation to break and then reconstitute inversion symmetry in a nominally symmetric diketopyrrolopyrrole, causing large changes in two&#8208;photon absorption. By performing detailed one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon titration experiments, with supporting quantum&#8208;chemical model calculations, we explain how certain low&#8208;frequency vibrational modes may lead to apparent deviations from the strict Laporte rule. As a result, the system may be indeed considered as an on&#8208;off&#8208;on inversion symmetry switch, opening new avenues for two&#8208;photon sensing applications.

Abstract
Hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) represents one of the most attractive labeling methods to synthesize deuterium&#8208; and tritium&#8208;labeled compounds. Catalytic HIE methods that enable site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond activation and exchange labeling with gaseous isotopes D2 and T2 are of vital importance, in particular for high&#8208;specific&#8208;activity tritiation of pharmaceuticals. As part of our interest in exploring s&#8208;block metals for catalytic transformations, we found CsN(SiMe3)2 to be an efficient catalyst for selective HIE of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds with D2 gas. The reaction proceeds through a kinetic deprotonative equilibrium that establishes an exchange pathway between C&#8722;H bonds and D2 gas. By virtue of multiple C&#8722;H bonds activation and high activity (isotope enrichment up to 99&#8201;%), the simple cesium amide catalyst provided a very powerful and practically convenient labeling protocol for synthesis of highly deuterated compounds and high&#8208;specific&#8208;activity tritiation of pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Controlled Formation and Rotation of Magnetic Nanochains In Vivo for Precise Mechanotherapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;mode imaging&#8208;guided cancer mechanotherapy was developed through in situ assembly and spinning of magnetic nanochains. This novel therapeutic modality could be suitable for precise yet effective cancer treatment in local regions.







Abstract
Systemic cancer therapy is always accompanied with toxicity to normal tissue, which has prompted concerted efforts to develop precise treatment strategies. Herein, we firstly develop an approach that enables spatiotemporally controlled formation and rotation of magnetic nanochains in vivo, allowing for precise mechanotherapy of tumor. The nanochain comprised nanocomposites of pheophorbide&#8208;A (PP) modified iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP) and lanthanide&#8208;doped down&#8208;conversion NP (DCNP). In a permanent magnetic field, the nanocomposites would be aligned to form nanochain. Next, MnO2 NPs were subsequently administered to accumulate in tumor as suppliers of Mn2+, which coordinates with PP to immobilize the nanochain. In a rotating magnetic field, the nanochain would rapidly rotate, leading to apoptosis/necrosis of tumor cell. The nanochain showed high T2&#8208;MR and NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging signals, which facilitated guided therapy. The strategy has great potential in practical applications.

         <title>Advancement of Electrochemical Thermoelectric Conversion with Molecular Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermocells are a type of battery that produces electricity from a temperature difference between the two electrodes. Recent studies have shown various molecular technologies can be effectively used in thermocells to increase the voltage. This Minireview provides a thorough comparison of four basic strategies&#8212;redox entropy, molecular recognition, phase separation, and phase transition&#8212;for boosting the thermoelectric efficiency.







Abstract
Thermocells are a thermoelectric conversion technology that utilizes the shift in an electrochemical equilibrium arising from a temperature difference. This technology has a long history; however, its low conversion efficiency impedes its practical usage. Recently, an increasing number of reports have shown drastic improvements in thermoelectric conversion efficiency, and thermocells could arguably represent an alternative to solid thermoelectric devices. In this Minireview, we regard thermocells as molecular systems consisting of successive molecular processes responding to a temperature change to achieve energy generation. Various molecular technologies have been applied to thermocells in recent years, and could stimulate diverse research fields, including supramolecular chemistry, physical chemistry, electrochemistry, and solid&#8208;state ionics. These research approaches will also provide novel methods for achieving a sustainable society in the future.

         <title>The Single&#8208;Component Flavin Reductase/Flavin&#8208;Dependent Halogenase AetF is a Versatile Catalyst for Selective Bromination and Iodination of Arenes and Olefins
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single component flavin reductase/flavin dependent halogenase AetF catalyzes halogenation of a diverse set of substrates. High site selectivity, activity on relatively unactivated substrates, and high enantioselectivity for atroposelective bromination and bromolactonization was demonstrated. Site&#8208;selective iodination and enantioselective cycloiodoetherification was also possible using AetF.







Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) natively catalyze selective halogenation of electron rich aromatic and enolate groups. Nearly all FDHs reported to date require a separate flavin reductase to supply them with FADH2, which complicates biocatalysis applications. In this study, we establish that the single component flavin reductase/flavin dependent halogenase AetF catalyzes halogenation of a diverse set of substrates using a commercially available glucose dehydrogenase to drive its halogenase activity. High site selectivity, activity on relatively unactivated substrates, and high enantioselectivity for atroposelective bromination and bromolactonization was demonstrated. Site&#8208;selective iodination and enantioselective cycloiodoetherification was also possible using AetF. The substrate and reaction scope of AetF suggest that it has the potential to greatly improve the utility of biocatalytic halogenation.

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Structures of Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Coordination Environment Engineering for Boosting CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three Ni2 dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) with tailored electronic structures by the regulation of the coordination environment of Ni atoms, have been prepared for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. The optimal Ni2&#8722;N3C4 exhibits the highest performance for the reduction of CO2 to CO, highlighting the significance of the electronic structure for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction in DACs.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have emerged as efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction owing to the synergistic effect between the binary metal sites. However, rationally modulating the electronic structure of DACs to optimize the catalytic performance remains a great challenge. Herein, we report the electronic structure modulation of three Ni2 DACs (namely, Ni2&#8722;N7, Ni2&#8722;N5C2 and Ni2&#8722;N3C4) by the regulation of the coordination environments around the dual&#8208;atom Ni2 centres. As a result, Ni2&#8722;N3C4 exhibits significantly improved electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction, not only better than the corresponding single&#8208;atom Ni catalyst (Ni&#8722;N2C2), but also higher than Ni2&#8722;N7 and Ni2&#8722;N5C2 DACs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the high electrocatalytic activity of Ni2&#8722;N3C4 for CO2 reduction could be attributed to the electronic structure modulation to the Ni centre and the resulted proper binding energies to COOH* and CO* intermediates.

As a result, Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits significantly improved electrocatalytic activity for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, not only better than the corresponding single-atom Ni catalyst (Ni&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but also higher than Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; DACs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the high electrocatalytic activity of Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction could be attributed to the electronic structure modulation to the Ni centre and the resulted proper binding energies to COOH* and CO* intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Carboxylation Enabled by a Chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective carboxylation reaction using CO2 has been demonstrated as efficient for the synthesis of chiral carboxylic acids including profen family anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs. The reaction takes place under atmospheric pressure and benefits from mild conditions using nickel&#8208;catalysis in combination with a chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand, namely Me&#8208;Sbpy.







Abstract
In contrast to previous approaches to chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic acids that based on reactions using hazardous gases, pressurized setup and mostly noble metal catalysts, in this work, a nickel&#8208;catalyzed general, efficient and highly enantioselective carboxylation reaction of racemic benzylic (pseudo)halides under mild conditions using atmospheric CO2 has been developed. A unique chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand named Me&#8208;SBpy featuring compact polycyclic skeleton enabled both high reactivity and stereoselectivity. The utility of this method has been demonstrated by synthesis of various chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic acids (30 examples, up to 95&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er), including profen family anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs and transformations using the acids as key intermediates. Based on mechanistic experimental results, a plausible catalytic cycle involving Ni&#8208;complex/radical equilibrium and Lewis acid&#8208;assisted CO2 activation has been proposed.

         <title>Atom&#8208;Economical Synthesis of Dimethyl Carbonate from CO2: Engineering Reactive Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Ceria with Vacancy Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling vacancy clusters on the surface of CeO2 allows construction of solid frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) that mediate CO2 conversion to dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The FLPs promote the production of DMC by lowering the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) barrier (CH3OCOO*&#8594;CH3OCO*+*O).







Abstract
The chemical conversion of CO2 to long&#8208;chain chemicals is considered as a highly attractive method to produce value&#8208;added organics, while the underlying reaction mechanism remains unclear. By constructing surface vacancy&#8208;cluster&#8208;mediated solid frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), the 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;economical, efficient chemical conversion of CO2 to dimethyl carbonate (DMC) was realized. By taking CeO2 as a model system, we illustrate that FLP sites can efficiently accelerate the coupling and conversion of key intermediates. As demonstrated, CeO2 with rich FLP sites shows improved reaction activity and achieves a high yield of DMC up to 15.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. In addition, by means of synchrotron radiation in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier&#8208;transform spectroscopy, combined with density functional theory calculations, the reaction mechanism on the FLP site was investigated systematically and in&#8208;depth, providing pioneering insights into the underlying pathway for CO2 chemical conversion to long&#8208;chain chemicals.

         <title>Hydrogen Drives Part of the Reverse Krebs Cycle under Metal or Meteorite Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen is a geological reducing agent that powers the metabolisms of modern organisms and potentially also powered the metabolism of the last universal common ancestor to all extant life. It is shown that catalytic amounts of transition metals or small amounts of powdered meteorites allow hydrogen to drive a key sequence of the reverse Krebs cycle under mild aqueous non&#8208;enzymatic conditions potentially relevant to the emergence of metabolic networks.







Abstract
Hydrogen (H2) is a geological source of reducing electrons that is thought to have powered the metabolism of the last universal common ancestor to all extant life, and that is still metabolized by various modern organisms. It has been suggested that H2 drove a geochemical analogue of some or all of the reverse Krebs cycle at the emergence of the metabolic network, catalyzed by metals, but this has yet to be demonstrated experimentally. Herein, we show that three consecutive steps of the reverse Krebs cycle, converting oxaloacetate into succinate, can be driven without enzymes and in one&#8208;pot by H2 as the reducing agent under mild conditions compatible with biological chemistry. Low catalytic amounts of nickel (10&#8211;20&#8197;mol&#8201;%) or platinum group metals (0.1&#8211;1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) or even small amounts of ground meteorites were found to promote the reductive chemistry at temperatures between 5 and 60&#8201;&#176;C and over a wide pH range, including pH&#8197;7. These results lend additional support to the hypothesis that geologically produced hydrogen and metal catalysts could have initiated early metabolic networks.

A fused benzo&#8208;aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;[5&#8208;6&#8208;5] tetracycle was concisely constructed via Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization with readily available anilines and 3&#8208;butenoic acid. Five chemical bonds and a fused tricycle were formed in one step. This strategy offers an option for synthesizing the common core of natural products martinelline, martinellic acid, seneciobipyrrolidine and incargranine&#8197;B. Experimental and computational studies shed light on the mechanism.







Abstract
A novel and expedient cascade strategy has been demonstrated for the synthesis of fused benzo&#8208;aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;[5&#8208;6&#8208;5] tetracycles in high yields and diastereoselectivities (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). The strategy was fulfilled through palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative convergent assembly of functionally divergent anilines and 3&#8208;butenoic acid with five chemical bonds constructed. Coupled with control experiments and deuterium labelled studies, DFT calculations were performed for the proposed mechanism. The utility of the illustrated strategy is emphasized by gram&#8208;scale syntheses, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and the transformation to a key core of natural products such as martinellic acid and seneciobipyrrolidine.

         <title>Unraveling the Catalyst&#8208;Solvent Interactions in Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Sulfur Reduction Electrocatalysis for Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalyst&#8208;solvent interaction is found to determine the lean&#8208;electrolyte sulfur reduction activity and cyclic stability for Li&#8722;S batteries. This interaction is confirmed via a series of synchrotron&#8208;based analysis, in situ spectroscopy and theoretical computations. Benefitting from the strong interaction between solvent and cobalt catalyst, the Li&#8722;S battery achieves stable cycling and high capacity retention under lean electrolyte conditions.







Abstract
Efficient catalyst design is important for lean&#8208;electrolyte sulfur reduction in Li&#8722;S batteries. However, most of the reported catalysts were focused on catalyst&#8208;polysulfide interactions, and generally exhibit high activity only with a large excess of electrolyte. Herein, we proposed a general rule to boost lean&#8208;electrolyte sulfur reduction by controlling the catalyst&#8208;solvent interactions. As evidenced by synchrotron&#8208;based analysis, in situ spectroscopy and theoretical computations, strong catalyst&#8208;solvent interaction greatly enhances the lean&#8208;electrolyte catalytic activity and battery stability. Benefitting from the strong interaction between solvent and cobalt catalyst, the Li&#8722;S battery achieves stable cycling with only 0.22&#8201;% capacity decay per cycle with a low electrolyte/sulfur mass ratio of 4.2.

     alt="Unraveling the Catalyst-Solvent Interactions in Lean-Electrolyte Sulfur Reduction Electrocatalysis for Li&#8722;S Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalyst-solvent interaction is found to determine the lean-electrolyte sulfur reduction activity and cyclic stability for Li&#8722;S batteries. This interaction is confirmed via a series of synchrotron-based analysis, in situ spectroscopy and theoretical computations. Benefitting from the strong interaction between solvent and cobalt catalyst, the Li&#8722;S battery achieves stable cycling and high capacity retention under lean electrolyte conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient catalyst design is important for lean-electrolyte sulfur reduction in Li&#8722;S batteries. However, most of the reported catalysts were focused on catalyst-polysulfide interactions, and generally exhibit high activity only with a large excess of electrolyte. Herein, we proposed a general rule to boost lean-electrolyte sulfur reduction by controlling the catalyst-solvent interactions. As evidenced by synchrotron-based analysis, in situ spectroscopy and theoretical computations, strong catalyst-solvent interaction greatly enhances the lean-electrolyte catalytic activity and battery stability. Benefitting from the strong interaction between solvent and cobalt catalyst, the Li&#8722;S battery achieves stable cycling with only 0.22&#8201;% capacity decay per cycle with a low electrolyte/sulfur mass ratio of 4.2. The lean-electrolyte battery delivers 79&#8201;% capacity retention compared with the battery with flooded electrolyte, which is the highest among the reported lean-electrolyte Li&#8722;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bromine Assisted MnO2 Dissolution Chemistry: Toward a Hybrid Flow Battery with Energy Density of over 300&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1</title>

The introduced Br&#8722; can avoid the accumulation of &#8220;dead&#8221; MnO2 formed during charging and improve the reversibility by chemical&#8208;electrochemical reactions.







Abstract
Mn2+/Mn3+ redox pair has been considered as a promising cathode for high energy density batteries, due to its attractive features of high redox potential, solubility and outstanding kinetics. However, the disproportionation side reaction of Mn3+, which results in accumulation of &#8220;dead&#8221; MnO2 limits its reversibility and further energy density. Herein, a novel catholyte based on mixture of Mn2+ and Br&#8722; was proposed for flow batteries with high energy density and long cycle life. In the design, the &#8220;dead&#8221; MnO2 can be fully discharged via Br&#8722; by a chemical&#8208;electrochemical reaction. Coupled with Cd/Cd2+ as anode, the assembled Bromine&#8208;Manganese flow battery (BMFB) demonstrates a high energy efficiency of 76&#8201;% at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with energy density of 360&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1. The battery assembled with silicotungstic acid as anode could continuously run for over 2000 cycles at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. With high power density, energy density and durability, the BMFB shows great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>A Sustainable NH4+ Ion Battery by Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an effective and sustainable strategy for the water hydrogen bond network modulation by adding sucrose into the electrolytes. The sucrose can form sucrose&#8208;water hydrogen bond networks to break the continuous water hydrogen bond network, thereby inhibiting water decomposition. Moreover, the weak hydrogen bond interaction between ammonium and sucrose facilitates ion migration, leading to an improved ionic conductivity.







Abstract
Aqueous ammonium ion battery is a promising sustainable energy storage system. However, the side reactions originating from electrolytes (the water decomposition and host material dissolution) preclude its practical applications. Unlike the metal&#8208;based aqueous batteries, the idea of &#8220;ultrahigh concentrated electrolyte&#8221; is not feasible due to the strong hydrolysis of ammonium ions. Therefore, we propose an effective and sustainable strategy for the water hydrogen bond network modulation by adding sucrose into the electrolytes. The sucrose can form sucrose&#8208;water hydrogen bond networks to break the continuous water hydrogen bond network, thereby inhibiting water decomposition significantly. Moreover, the weak hydrogen bond interaction between ammonium and sucrose facilitates rapid ion migration, leading to an improved ionic conductivity. This work presents a new electrolyte modulating strategy for the practical application of aqueous ammonium ion batteries.

         <title>Fast Screening for Copper&#8208;Based Bimetallic Electrocatalysts: Efficient Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to C2+ Products on Magnesium&#8208;Modified Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using an automatic fast screening platform, a magnesium&#8208;modified copper catalyst has been discovered to be very efficient for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to C2+ compounds. This catalyst, achieving 80&#8201;% C2+ Faradaic efficiency at a current density of 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, stands out from 109 Cu&#8208;based bimetallic catalysts evaluated within only 55&#8197;hours. The modification by magnesium enhances the activation of CO2 and stabilizes Cu+ to facilitate the CO adsorption and C&#8722;C coupling.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 (CO2RR) into high value&#8208;added chemicals is an attractive route to achieve carbon neutrality. However, the development of an efficient catalyst for CO2RR is still largely by trial&#8208;and&#8208;error and is very time&#8208;consuming. Herein, we built an electrocatalyst testing platform featuring a home&#8208;built automatic flow cell to accelerate the discovery of efficient catalysts. A fast screening of 109 Cu&#8208;based bimetallic catalysts in only 55&#8197;h identifies Mg combined with Cu as the best electrocatalyst for CO2 to C2+ products. The thus designed Mg&#8722;Cu catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products up to 80&#8201;% with a current density of 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.77&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Systematic experiments with in situ spectroelectrochemistry analyses show that Mg2+ species stabilize Cu+ sites during CO2RR and promote the CO2 activation, thus enhancing the *CO coverage to promote C&#8722;C coupling.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Hydrosilylation to Access Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented (SiMOS&#8208;Phos) ligand&#8208;controlled Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of &#8220;silicon&#8208;centered&#8221; racemic hydrosilanes was developed for the highly efficient and enantioselective construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers of benzosiloles (up to 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 er). This achievement was obtained by using an original synthetic strategy involving dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformations.







Abstract
Strategies on the construction of enantiomerically pure silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanes generally relies on desymmetrization of prochiral and symmetric substrates. However, dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformations of organosilicon compounds have remained underdeveloped and unforeseen owing to a lack of an effective method for deracemization of the static silicon stereocenters. Here we report the first Rh&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric intramolecular hydrosilylation (DyKAH) with &#8220;silicon&#8208;centered&#8221; racemic hydrosilanes that enables the facile preparation of silicon&#8208;stereogenic benzosiloles in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. The special rhodium catalyst controlled by non&#8208;diastereopure&#8208;type mixed phosphine&#8208;phosphoramidite ligand with axial chirality and multiple stereocenters can induce enantioselectivity efficiently in this novel DyKAH reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the amide moiety in chiral ligand plays important role in facilitating the SN2 substitution of chloride ion to realize the chiral inversion of silicon center.

         <title>A Flexible Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Constructed from a Tetrabenzaldehyde with a Carbazole N&#8722;H Binding Site for the Highly Selective Recognition and Separation of Acetone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining tetrabenzaldeyde for hydrogen bonding interactions, a carbazole N&#8722;H site for the specific recognition of small molecules, and a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A building molecule for solvent&#8208;dependent chromic properties has led to the hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;2. This combination has enabled the separation of an acetone/methanol mixture to be readily visualized.







Abstract
Rational design of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with multiple functionalities is highly sought after but challenging. Herein, we report a multifunctional HOF (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;2) built from 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazole&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzaldehyde molecule with tetrabenzaldeyde for their H bonding interactions and carbazole N&#8722;H site for its specific recognition of small molecules. The Lewis acid N&#8722;H sites allow HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;2 facilely separate acetone from its mixture with another solvent like methanol with smaller pKa value. The donor (D)&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (A) aromatic nature of the organic building molecule endows this HOF with solvent dependent luminescent/chromic properties, so the column acetone/methanol separation on HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;2 can be readily visualized.

         <title>Structure Elucidation of In Situ Generated Chiral Hypervalent Iodine Complexes via Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy was used by Boris&#8197;J. Nachtsheim, Christian Merten et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202204624) to verify DFT&#8208;calculated chiral iodane structures. Based on a chiral triazole&#8208;substituted iodoarene catalyst, a yet undescribed cationic chiral iodane was elucidated as the most populated intermediate under oxidative conditions with a significant intermolecular N&#8211;I interaction.

         <title>Compacting Electric Double Layer Enables Carbon Electrode with Ultrahigh Zn Ion Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrical double layer (EDL) of carbon electrode can be compacted via surface charge modulation strategy to boost Zn ion storage capability. Zn//amino functionalized carbon Zn ion hybrid supercapacitor can deliver an ultrahigh capacity of 255.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 as well as excellent cycling stability.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based cathodes for aqueous zinc ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs) typically undergo low Zn ion storage capability due to their electric double layer capacitance (EDLC) energy storage mechanism that is restricted by specific surface area and thickness of electric double layer (EDL). Here, we report a universal surface charge modulation strategy to effectively enhance the capacitance of carbon materials by decreasing the thickness of EDL. Amino groups with lone pair electrons were chosen to increase the surface charge density and enhanced the interaction between carbon electrode and Zn ions, thus effectively compacting the EDL. Consequently, amino functionalized porous carbon based ZHSCs can deliver an ultrahigh capacity of 255.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 along with excellent cycling stability (95.5&#8201;% capacity retention after 50&#8201;000 cycles) in 1&#8197;M ZnCl2 electrolyte. This study demonstrates the feasibility of EDL modified carbon as Zn2+ storage cathode and great prospect for constructing high performance ZHSCs.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Expanded Carbazoles as Hole&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular design strategy is introduced for carbazole&#8208;derived self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAM) to facilitate dense assembly and tune the indium tinoxide (ITO) workfunction. Through asymmetric or helical &#960;&#8208;expansion, CbzPh and CbzNaph are obtained as efficient hole&#8208;selective layers (HSL) for inverted perovskite solar cells (PSC). Larger molecular dipoles in CbzPh and CbzNaph can better tune the ITO workfunction, whereas the stronger &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions ensure more ordered and denser SAM assembly. As a result, the champion device of CbzNaph&#8208;based inverted PSCs achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 24.1&#8201;% and improved device stability, which is the best among PSCs with a SAM HSL.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;derived self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) are promising hole&#8208;selective materials for inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, they often possess small dipoles which prohibit them from effectively modulating the workfunction of ITO substrate, limiting the PSC photovoltage. Moreover, their properties can be drastically affected by even subtle structural modifications, undermining the final PSC performance. Here, we designed two carbazole&#8208;derived SAMs, CbzPh and CbzNaph through asymmetric or helical &#960;&#8208;expansion for improved molecular dipole moment and strengthened &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction. The helical &#960;&#8208;expanded CbzNaph has the largest dipole, forming densely packed and ordered monolayer, facilitated by the highly ordered assembly observed in its &#960;&#8208;scaffold's single crystal. These synergistically modulate the perovskite crystallization atop and tune the ITO workfunction. Consequently, the champion PSC employing CbzNaph showed an excellent 24.1&#8201;% efficiency and improved stability.

Consequently, the champion PSC employing CbzNaph showed an excellent 24.1&#8201;% efficiency and improved stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Vivo Nitroreductase Imaging via Fluorescence and Chemical Shift Dependent 19F NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimodal imaging probe FCy7&#8208;NO2 was applied to image nitroreductase overexpressed by lung cancer in&#8197;vivo as reported by Xin Zhou et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202213495). Integrating two complementary imaging technologies into FCy7&#8208;NO2 enables sensitive detection of nitroreductase in a broad concentration range without tissue&#8208;depth limit.

         <title>Unravelling the Complex LiOH&#8208;Based Cathode Chemistry in Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The LiOH&#8208;based cathode chemistry has demonstrated potential for high&#8208;energy Li&#8211;O2 batteries. However, the understanding of such complex chemistry remains incomplete. Herein, we use the combined experimental methods with ab initio calculations to study LiOH chemistry. We provide a unified reaction mechanism for LiOH formation during discharge via net 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction, in which Li2O2 acts as intermediate in low water&#8208;content electrolyte but LiHO2 as intermediate in high water&#8208;content electrolyte. Besides, LiOH decomposes via 1e&#8722; oxidation during charge, generating surface&#8208;reactive hydroxyl species that degrade organic electrolytes and generate protons. These protons lead to early removal of LiOH, followed by a new high&#8208;potential charge plateau (1e&#8722; water oxidation). At following cycles, these accumulated protons lead to a new high&#8208;potential discharge plateau, corresponding to water formation. Our findings shed light on understanding of 4e&#8722; cathode chemistries in metal&#8211;air batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Helical Bilayer Nonbenzenoid Nanographene Bearing a [10]Helicene with Two Embedded Heptagons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precision synthesis of helical bilayer nanographenes (NGs) with new topology is of substantial interest due to their exotic&#160;physicochemical properties. However, helical bilayer NGs bearing non&#8208;hexagonal rings remain synthetically challenging. Here&#160;we present the efficient synthesis of the first helical bilayer nonbenzenoid nanographene (HBNG1) from a tailed&#8208;made azulene&#8208;embedded precursor, which contains a novel [10]helicene backbone with two embedded heptagons.&#160;Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis reveals its highly twisted bilayer geometry with a record small&#160;interlayer distance&#160;of 3.2 &#197; among the reported helical bilayer NGs. Notably, the close interlayer distance between the two layers offers intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation as revealed by&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;spectroelectrochemistry studies together with DFT simulations. Furthermore, the&#160;chiroptical properties&#160;of the&#160;P/M&#160;enantiomers of&#160;HBNG1&#160;are also evaluated by circular dichroism and&#160;circularly polarized luminescence.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP), or organic afterglow, is a unique phenomenon, gaining widespread attention due to its far&#8208;reaching application potential and fundamental interest. Here, two laterally expanded 9,10&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9,10&#8208;diboraanthracene (DBA) derivatives are demonstrated as excellent afterglow materials for red and blue&#8208;green light emission, which is traced back to persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and RTP. The lateral substitution of polycyclic DBA scaffold, together with weak transversal electron&#8208;donating mesityl groups, ensures the optimal molecular properties for (reverse) intersystem crossing and long&#8208;lived triplet states in a rigid poly(methyl methacrylate) matrix. The achieved afterglow emission quantum yields of up to 3 % and 15 %, afterglow lifetimes up to 0.8&#160;s and 3.2&#160;s and afterglow durations up to 5 s and 25 s (for red and blue&#8208;green emitters, respectively) are attributed to the properties of single molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Proton Rectifier Using a Heterogeneous Membrane Composed of Coordination Polymer and Layered Double Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;solid&#8208;state proton rectifier was fabricated using a heterogeneous membrane composed of proton&#8208;conducting coordination polymer, Cu2(CuTCPP), and hydroxide ion&#8208;conducting layered double hydroxide, Mg&#8208;Al&#8208;LDH(NO3). The device demonstrated a proton rectification ratio greater than 200, which is the highest among the reported all&#8208;solid&#8208;state H+&#8722;OH&#8722; rectifiers.







Abstract
Rational control of unidirectional proton transport is highly challenging, primarily owing to the difficulty in introducing an asymmetric factor into proton conducting media. In this study, free&#8208;standing membranes of a proton&#8208;conducting two&#8208;dimensional porous coordination polymer, Cu2(CuTCPP) (H2TCPP: 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) and a hydroxide ion&#8208;conducting layered double hydroxide, Mg&#8208;Al&#8208;LDH(NO3), were combined to generate a pH gradient in the conducting media. The current&#8211;voltage measurements revealed that the heterogeneous membrane exhibits a significant unidirectional proton transport with a proton rectification ratio exceeding 200 under 90&#8201;% relative humidity in the initial voltage scan. This value is the highest among the reported all&#8208;solid&#8208;state proton rectifiers. The high designability of both components with well&#8208;defined structures, which is in contrast to the organic polymers used so far, provides a new avenue for developing and understanding the proton&#8208;rectifying behavior in the solid state.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Azaarylethynyl Tertiary Alcohols by Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysed Phosphine&#8208;Mediated Deoxygenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalysed phosphine&#8208;mediated deoxygenation protocol is reported. This metal&#8208;free method provides a precise kinetic resolution platform for azaarylethynyl tertiary alcohols, which are a broad category of biologically and synthetically important azaarene derivatives. In addition to providing an efficient method for the first asymmetric preparation of these tertiary alcohols, the strategy facilitates the construction of azaaryl&#8208;functionalized allenes with good to excellent enantioselectivities. The high selectivity factors (s up to 235), broad substrate scope, and capability of modulating azaaryls in both tertiary alcohols and allenes robustly underscore the considerable efficiency and promising utility of this method. Additionally, the practicability is further validated by the successful synthesis of deuterated allenes with high ee values and substantial incorporation of deuterium using inexpensive D2O as the deuterium source.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Benzene Oxidation with a Spin&#8208;State&#8208;Controlled Nuclearity Effect on Iron Sub&#8208;Nanocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fundamentally understanding the nature of nuclearity effects is very important for rational design of superior sub&#8208;nanocatalysts with low nuclearity but remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we have precisely synthesized Fe sub&#8208;nanocatalysts with tunable nuclearity (Fe1&#8211;Fe4) anchored on N, O&#8208;co&#8208;doped carbon nanorods (NOC) by atomic layer deposition. The electronic properties and spin configuration of the Fe sub&#8208;nanocatalysts are nuclearity&#8208;dependent and dominate the H2O2 activation modes and adsorption strength of active O species on Fe sites towards C&#8211;H oxidation. The Fe1&#8211;NOC single atom catalyst exhibits state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity for benzene oxidation to phenol ascribed to its unique coordination environment (Fe1N2O3) and medium spin state (t2g4eg1) supported by multifold characterization methods and DFT calculations, yielding TOF of 407 h&#8211;1 at 25&#176;C and 1869 h&#8211;1 at 60&#176;C, which is 3.4, 5.7 and 13.6 times higher than those of Fe dimer, trimer and tetramer catalysts, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Dendritic Quaternary&#8208;Encoded Oligourethanes for Data Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of sequence&#8208;defined digital polymers for data storage and encryption has received increasing attention due to their precision structures similar to natural biomacromolecules (e.g., DNA) but increased stability. However, the rapid development of sequencing techniques raises the concern of information leakage. Herein, dendritic quaternary&#8208;encoded oligourethanes bearing a photoresponsive trigger, self&#8208;immolative backbones, and a mass spectrometry tag of PEG dendron have been developed for data encryption. Although the sequence information in linear analogs can be readily deciphered by mass spectrometry, sequencing of dendritic oligourethanes cannot be achieved by either primary MS or tandem MS/MS owing to the unique spatial conformation. Intriguingly, the fragmentation pathways of a quaternary dendrimer under MS/MS conditions can be converted to 2772&#8208;bit 2D matrices with ~1.98 &#215; 1087 permutations, serving as high&#8208;strength encryption keys for highly reliable data encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>A Semi&#8208;solid Zinc Powder&#8208;based Slurry Anode for Advanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The booming of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) draws the researchers&#8217; attention to issues of zinc metal anodes, such as uncontrollable dendrite growth, corrosion, and volume effects. Zinc powder anode is more suitable for the industrial application of AZIBs than the widely used zinc foil anode due to its low cost, tunability and processability. However, the related solutions are rarely studied because the above issues of zinc metal anode are more serious in zinc powder anode. Herein, for the first time, we design a semi&#8208;solid zinc slurry anode consisting of zinc powder and zincophilic tin additive dispersed in a conductive elastic rheological network. Zinc can be deposited homogeneously on the dispersed tin particles, which avoids agglomerative zinc deposition and alleviates volume change during repeated zinc plating/stripping. Moreover, the practical application of the full cell with slurry is very promising since its operating life can be easily extended by facile slurry renewal.</dc:description>

         <title>Modelling&#160;Development in Radical (Co)Polymerization of Multivinyl Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical polymerization (RP) of multivinyl monomers (MVMs) provides a facile solution for manipulating polymer topology and has received increasing attention due to their industrial and academic significance. Continuous efforts have been made to understand their mechanism, which is the key to regulating materials structure. Modelling techniques have become a powerful tool that can provide detailed information on polymerization kinetics which is inaccessible by experiments. Many publications have reported the combination of experiments and modelling for free radical polymerization (FRP) and reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerizations (RDRP) of MVMs. Herein, a minireview is presented for the most important modelling techniques and their applications in FRP/RDRP of MVMs. This review hopes to illustrate that the combination of modelling and wet experiments can be a great asset to polymer researchers and inspire new thinking for the future MVMs experiment optimization and product design.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfaces with Fluorinated Amphiphiles: Superstructures and Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present mini&#8208;review discusses recent developments in research on interfacial phenomena of fluorinated amphiphiles, focusing on applications that exploit the unique and manifold interfacial properties associated with these amphiphiles. Most notably, fluorinated amphiphiles form stable aggregates with often distinctly different morphologies than their non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts. Consequently, fluorinated surfactants have found wide use in high&#8208;performance applications such as microfluidic&#8208;assisted screening. Additionally, their fluorine&#8208;specific behaviour at the solid/liquid interface, such as the formation of superhydrophobic coatings after deposition on surfaces, will be discussed. As fluorinated surfactants and perfluorinated materials in general pose potential environmental threats, recent developments in their remediation based on their adsorption onto fluorinated surfaces will be evaluated.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Control in Micro&#8208;/Nanomotor Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unprecedented opportunities exist for the generation of advanced nanotechnologies based on synthetic micro/nanomotors, such as active transport of medical agents or the removal of pollutants. In this regard, great efforts have been dedicated toward controlling motors' motion (e.g., speed, directionality). This was generally performed by precise engineering and optimizing of the motors' chassis, engine, powering mode (i.e., chemical or physical), and mechanism of motion. Recently, new insights have emerged to control motors mobility, mainly by the inclusion of different modes that drive motor propulsion. With high degree of synchronization, these modes work in a fashion that provides the required level of control. In this review, we discuss the diverse factors that impact motors' motion; these include motors' morphology, modes of mobility, and how control over motion was achieved. Moreover, we highlight the main limitations that need to be overcome so that such motion control can be translated into real applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Deaminative Hydroxylation of Aminoheterocycles and Electron&#8208;Deficient Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the tools available to chemists for drug design of bioactive compounds, the bioisosteric replacement of atoms or groups of atoms is the cornerstone of modern strategies. Despite the undeniable interest in amino&#8208;to&#8208;hydroxyl interchange, enzymatic deaminative hydroxylation remains unmatched. Herein, we report a user friendly and safe procedure to selectively convert aminoheterocycles to their hydroxylated analogues by means of a simple pyrylium tetrafluoroborate salt. The hydroxylation step relies on a Lossen&#8208;type rearrangement under mild conditions thus avoiding the use of strong hydroxide bases. In addition to biorelevant heterocycles, the deaminative hydroxylation of electron&#8208;deficient anilines was also demonstrated. Finally, mechanistic experiments allowed the identification of the key intermediates, thus unveiling a rather unusual mechanism for this formal aromatic substitution.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Fluorogenic Amino Acids for Peptide&#8208;Guided Background&#8208;Free Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multiple applications of super&#8208;resolution microscopy have prompted the need for minimally invasive labeling strategies for peptide&#8208;guided fluorescence imaging. Many fluorescent reporters display limitations (e.g., large and charged scaffolds, non&#8208;specific binding) as building blocks for the construction of fluorogenic peptides. Herein we have built a library of benzodiazole amino acids and systematically examined them as reporters for background&#8208;free fluorescence microscopy. We have identified amine&#8208;derivatized benzoselenadiazoles as scalable and photostable amino acids for the straightforward solid&#8208;phase synthesis of fluorescent peptides. Benzodiazole amino acids retain the binding capabilities of bioactive peptides and display excellent signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios. Furthermore, we have demonstrated their application in peptide&#8208;PAINT imaging of postsynaptic density protein&#8208;95 nanoclusters in the synaptosomes from mouse brain tissues.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, bioinspired total syntheses of A201A, A201D, and A201E based on a previously reported biosynthetic pathway are presented. The challenging 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;furanoside, a core structure of the A201 family, was obtained through remote 2&#8208;quinolinecarbonyl&#8208;assisted glycosylation. We accomplished the total synthesis of A201A and A201E based on the critical 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;furanoside moiety via late&#8208;stage glycosylation without any interference from basic dimethyl adenosine. We also confirmed the absolute configuration of A201E via total synthesis. This modular synthesis strategy enables efficient preparation of A201 family antibiotics, allowing the study of their structure&#8211;activity relationships and mode of action. This study satisfies the increasing demand for developing novel antibiotics inspired by the A201 family.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Assembly of Complex Oxindoles by Enantioselective Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary catalysis enabled the three&#8208;component reaction of N&#8208;aryl diazoamides, aldehydes, and enamines/indoles, providing access to polyfunctionalized oxindoles in good yields with excellent diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities (&gt;90 examples, up to 94&#8201;% yield, 99&#8201;% ee, and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr). The reaction involves the assembly of two highly reactive intermediates generated in situ by orthogonal catalytic processes under mild and operationally simple reaction conditions.







Abstract
Chiral oxindoles are important chemical scaffolds found in many natural products, and their enantioselective synthesis thus attracts considerable attention. Highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthetic methods for constructing C3 quaternary oxindoles have been well&#8208;developed. However, the efficient synthesis of chiral 3&#8208;substituted tertiary oxindoles has been rarely reported due to the ease of racemization of the tertiary stereocenter via enolization. Therefore, we herein report on the multicomponent assembly (from N&#8208;aryl diazoamides, aldehydes, and enamines/indoles) of complex oxindoles by enantioselective cooperative catalysis. These reactions proceed under mild conditions and show broad substrate scope, affording the desired coupling products (&gt;90 examples) with good to excellent stereocontrol. Additionally, this research also demonstrates the synthetic potential of this annulation by constructing the 6,6,5&#8208;tricyclic lactone core structure of Speradine&#8197;A.

         <title>Structure Elucidation, Total Synthesis, Antibacterial In Vivo Efficacy and Biosynthesis Proposal of Myxobacterial Corramycin
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corramycin is a novel natural product produced by the myxobacterium Corallococcus coralloides. The structure, extraordinary total synthesis and biosynthesis of the antibiotic is described for the first time. Promising in vivo septicemia model, the absence of cross&#8208;resistance with commonly used antibiotic classes, and the lack of cytotoxicity make Corramycin a potential new drug in the fight against multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the myxobacterial natural product Corramycin isolated from Corallococcus coralloides. The linear peptide structure contains an unprecedented (2R,3S)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;histidine moiety. Corramycin exhibits anti&#8208;Gram&#8208;negative activity against Escherichia coli (E.&#8197;coli) and is taken up via two transporter systems, SbmA and YejABEF. Furthermore, the Corramycin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was identified and a biosynthesis model was proposed involving a 12&#8208;modular non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthase. Bioinformatic analysis of the BGC combined with the development of a total synthesis route allowed for the elucidation of the molecule's absolute configuration. Importantly, intravenous administration of 20&#8197;mg&#8201;kg&#8722;1 of Corramycin in an E.&#8197;coli mouse infection model resulted in 100&#8201;% survival of animals without toxic side effects. Corramycin is thus a promising starting point to develop a potent antibacterial drug against hospital&#8208;acquired infections.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acceptor&#8208;acceptor type homopolymer PDTzTI&#8208;TEG bearing ethylene glycol side chains is synthesized and the doped PDTzTI&#8208;TEG exhibits n&#8208;type conductivity up to 34&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor of 15.7&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. These values are far superior to those of analogous acceptor&#8208;donor type copolymers, indicating that PDTzTI&#8208;TEG is a promising material for organic thermoelectrics.







Abstract
n&#8208;Type semiconducting polymers with high thermoelectric performance remain challenging due to the scarcity of molecular design strategy, limiting their applications in organic thermoelectric (OTE) devices. Herein, we provide a new approach to enhance the OTE performance of n&#8208;doped polymers by introducing acceptor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;A) type backbone bearing branched ethylene glycol (EG) side chains. When doped with 4&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzenamine (N&#8208;DMBI), the A&#8208;A homopolymer PDTzTI&#8208;TEG exhibits n&#8208;type electrical conductivity (&#963;) up to 34&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor value of 15.7&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. The OTE performance of PDTzTI&#8208;TEG is far greater than that of homopolymer PBTI&#8208;TEG (&#963;=0.27&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), indicating that introducing electron&#8208;deficient thiazole units in the backbone further improves the n&#8208;doping efficiency. These results demonstrate that developing A&#8208;A type polymers with EG side chains is an effective strategy to enhance n&#8208;type OTE performance.

         <title>Peptide Amphiphile Mediated Co&#8208;assembly for Nanoplasmonic Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic interactions are commonly involved in the assembly of naturally occurring building blocks, and these interactions can be replicated in an artificial setting to produce functional materials. Here we describe a colorimetric biosensor using co&#8208;assembly experiments with plasmonic gold and surfactant&#8208;like peptides (SLPs) spanning a wide range of aromatic residues, polar stretches, and interfacial affinities. The SLPs programmed in DDD&#8722;(ZZ) x &#8722;FFPC self&#8208;assemble into higher&#8208;order structures in response to a protease and subsequently modulate the colloidal dispersity of gold leading to a colorimetric readout. Results show the strong aggregation propensity of the FFPC tail without polar DDD head. The SLPs were specific to the target protease, i.e., Mpro, a biomarker for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. This system is a simple and visual tool that senses Mpro in phosphate buffer, exhaled breath condensate, and saliva with detection limits of 15.7, 20.8, and 26.1 nM, respectively. These results may have value in designing other protease testing methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Closing Aminoalkylative Amination of Unactivated Aminoenynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient strategy for preventing the &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination of alkylpalladium species by ligation of the palladium with adjacent amino&#8208;group was developed, which enabled a novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing aminoalkylative amination of unactivated aminoenynes. The reaction is amenable to aminals, as well as aliphatic aldehydes with secondary amines, which provides straightforward access to structurally diverse exocyclic allenic amines bearing 5 to 12&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. With chiral phosphoramidite&#8208;ligated palladium complex as the catalyst, an enantioselective variant was achieved with up to 93% ee. Simultaneously, synthetic transformations of the chiral products were also conducted to afford structurally unique spirodiamines including one pharmaceutically active molecule via axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>(BO)2&#8208;Doped Tetrathia[7]helicene: A&#160;Configurationally Stable Blue Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicenes combine two central themes in chemistry: extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and chirality. Heteroatom doping preserves both characteristics and allows to modulate the electronic structure of a helicene. Herein, we report the (BO)2&#8208;doped tetrathia[7]helicene 1, which was prepared from 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;3,3&#8217;&#8208;bithiophene via four steps. 1 is formally derived by substituting two (Mes)B&#8210;O moieties in place of (H)C=C(H) fragments in two benzene rings of parent tetrathia[7]helicene. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a dihedral angle of 50.26(9)&#176; between the two terminal thiophene rings. (P)&#8208;/(M)&#8208;1 enantiomers were separated by chiral&#8208;HPLC and are configurationally stable at room temperature. The experimentally determined enantiomerization barrier of 27.4 &#177; 0.1 kcal mol&#8210;1 is lower than that of tetrathia[7]helicene (39.4 &#177; 0.1 kcal mol&#8210;1). Circular dichroism spectra of (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;1 show a perfect mirror&#8208;image relationship. 1 is a blue emitter (&#955;em = 411 nm) with a photoluminescence quantum efficiency of &#934;PL = 6% (cf. tetrathia[7]helicene: &#955;em &#8776; 405 nm, &#934;PL = 5%).</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Covalent Organic Frameworks with Polyethylene Glycol as Self&#8208;Sustained Humidity&#8208;Responsive Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regarding the global energy crisis, it is of profound significance to develop spontaneous power generators that harvest natural energy. Fabricating humidity&#8208;responsive actuators that can conduct such energy transduction is of paramount importance. Herein, we incorporate covalent organic frameworks with flexible polyethylene glycol to fabricate rigid&#8208;flexible coupled membrane actuators. This strategy significantly improves the mechanical properties and humidity&#8208;responsive performance of the actuators, meanwhile the existence of ordered structures enables us to unveil the actuation mechanism. These high&#8208;performance actuators can achieve various actuation applications and exhibit interesting self&#8208;oscillation behavior above a water surface. Finally, after being coupled with a piezoelectric film, the bilayer device can spontaneously output electricity over 2 days. This work paves a new avenue to fabricate rigid&#8208;flexible coupled actuators for self&#8208;sustained energy transduction.</dc:description>

         <title>J&#8208;Aggregates Formed by NaCl Treatment of Aza&#8208;Coating Heptamethine Cyanines and Their Application to Monitoring Salt Stress of Plants and Promoting Photothermal Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cationic nature of heptamethine cyanines gives them the capacity to form aggregates with salts by electrostatic interactions. In this work, NaCl promoted J&#8208;aggregate formation of aza&#8208;coating heptamethine cyanines is explored. NaCl can induce the N&#8208;benzyloxycarbonyl Cy&#8208;CO2Bz to assemble into a J&#8208;aggregate having an absorption at 890 nm. Its excellent fluorescence response to NaCl implies that it has great potential for use as a probe for tracing salt stress in plants. Moreover, NaCl also promotes formation of J&#8208;aggregates from the N&#8208;ethyloxycarbonyl Cy&#8208;CO2Et. The aggregate shows an intense absorption at 910 nm compared to the monomer which absorbs at 766 nm. Its J&#8208;aggregated form can serve as a photothermal agent. And the photothermal conversion efficiency is increased from 29.37% to 57.59%. This effort leads to the development of two applications of new cyanine J&#8208;aggregates including one for tracing salt stress of plants and the other for promoting photothermal therapy of tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;intercalation of Dual Charge Carriers in Metal&#8208;ion&#8208;confining Layered Vanadium Oxide Nanobelts for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vanadium&#8208;based oxides with high theoretical specific capacities and open crystal structures are promising cathodes for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). In this work, the confined synthesis can insert metal ions into the interlayer spacing of layered vanadium oxide nanobelts without changing the original morphology. Furthermore, we obtain a series of nanomaterials based on metal&#8208;confined nanobelts, and describe the effect of interlayer spacing on the electrochemical performance. The electrochemical properties of the obtained Al2.65V6O13&#183;2.07H2O as cathodes for AZIBs are remarkably improved with a high initial capacity of 571.7 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1 at 1.0 A&#183;g&#8722;1. Even at a high current density of 5.0 A&#183;g&#8722;1, the initial capacity can still reach 205.7 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1, with a high capacity retention of 89.2% after 2000 cycles. This study demonstrates that nanobelts confined with metal ions can significantly improve energy storage applications, revealing new avenues for enhancing the electrochemical performance of AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelectric Ionic Molecular Crystals with Significant Plasticity and a Low Melting Point: High Performance in Hot&#8208;Pressed Polycrystalline Plates and Melt&#8208;Grown Crystalline Sheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among ferroelectric crystals based on small molecules, plastic/ferroelectric crystals are currently receiving particular attention because they can be used as bulk polycrystals. Herein, we show that an ionic molecular ferroelectric crystal, guanidinium tetrafluoroborate, exhibits significant malleability and multiaxial ferroelectricity despite the absence of a plastic crystal phase. Powder samples of this crystal can be processed into transparent bulk crystalline plates either by press&#8208;forming or by melt&#8208;growing. The plates show high ferroelectric performance and related properties, demonstrating the largest hitherto reported spontaneous polarization for bulk polycrystals of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based ferroelectrics. Owing to the ready availability of large&#8208;scale materials and processability into various bulk crystalline forms, this ferroelectric crystal represents a highly promising functional material that will boost research on diverse applications as bulk crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>A Ferroelectric Aminophosphonium Cyanoferrate with a&#160;Large Electrostrictive Coefficient as Piezoelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid materials possessing piezo&#8208; and ferroelectric properties emerge as excellent alternatives to conventional piezoceramics, due to their merits of facile synthesis, lightweight nature, ease of fabrication and mechanical flexibility. Inspired by the structural stability of aminophosphonium compounds, here we report the first A3BX6 type cyanometallate [Ph2(iPrNH)2P]3[Fe(CN)6] (1), which shows a ferroelectric saturation polarization (Ps) of 3.71 &#956;C cm&#8210;2. Compound 1 exhibits a high electrostrictive coefficient (Q33) of 0.73 m4 C&#8210;2, far exceeding those of piezoceramics (0.034&#8722;0.096 m4 C&#8210;2). Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) analysis demonstrates the polarization switching and domain structure of 1 further confirming its ferroelectric nature. Furthermore, thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) polymer composite films of 1 were prepared and employed as piezoelectric nanogenerators. Notably, the 15 wt % 1&#8208;TPU device gave a maximum output voltage of 13.57 V and a power density of 6.03 &#956;W cm&#8210;2.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A widely applicable, practical, and scalable synthetic method for efficient ene&#8208;type double oxidation of alkenes is reported via a two&#8208;step alkenyl thianthrenium umpolung/ Kornblum&#8208;Ganem oxidation strategy. This chemo&#8208; and stereoselective procedure allows easy access to various
&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls that may be otherwise difficult or cumbersome to synthesize by conventional methods. For &#945;&#8208;olefins, this metal&#8208;free transformation can be tuned according to synthetic needs to produce either the elusive (  Z  )&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes or their (  E  ) counterparts. Moreover, this strategy has enabled streamlined synthesis of distinct butadienyl pheromones and kairomones.</dc:description>

         <title>Predicting Collagen Triple Helix Stability through Additive Effects of Terminal Residues and Caps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Collagen model peptides (CMPs) consisting of proline&#8211; (2S,4R)&#8208;hydroxyproline&#8211;glycine (POG) repeats have provided a breadth of knowledge of the triple helical structure of collagen, the most abundant protein in mammals. Predictive tools for triple helix stability have, however, lagged behind since the effect of CMPs with different frames ([POG] n , [OGP] n , or [GPO] n ) and capped or uncapped termini have so far been underestimated. Here, we elucidated the impact of the frame, terminal functional group and its charge on the stability of collagen triple helices. Combined experimental and theoretical studies with frame&#8208;shifted, capped and uncapped CMPs revealed that electrostatic interactions, strand preorganization, interstrand H&#8208;bonding, and steric repulsion at the termini contribute to triple helix stability. We show that these individual contributions are additive and allow for the prediction of the melting temperatures of CMP trimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Schlenk&#8217;s Legacy &#8211; Methyllithium Put under Close Scrutiny</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Commercially available stock solutions of organolithium reagents are well&#8208;implemented tools in organic and organometallic chemistry. However, such solutions are &#8220;inherently&#8221; contaminated with lithium halide salts, which can complicate certain synthesis protocols and purification processes. Here, we report the synthesis and isolation of chloride&#8208;free methyllithium employing K[N(SiMe3)2] as a halide&#8208;trapping reagent. The influence of distinct LiCl contaminations on the 7Li NMR chemical shift is examined and their quantification demonstrated. The structural parameters of new chloride&#8208;free monomeric methyllithium complex [(Me3TACN)LiCH3], ligated by an azacrown ether, are assessed by comparison with a halide&#8208;contaminated variant and monomeric lithium chloride [(Me3TACN)LiCl], further emphasizing the effect of halide impurities.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Commercially available stock solutions of organolithium reagents are well-implemented tools in organic and organometallic chemistry. However, such solutions are &#8220;inherently&#8221; contaminated with lithium halide salts, which can complicate certain synthesis protocols and purification processes. Here, we report the synthesis and isolation of chloride-free methyllithium employing K[N(SiMe3)2] as a halide-trapping reagent. The influence of distinct LiCl contaminations on the 7Li NMR chemical shift is examined and their quantification demonstrated. The structural parameters of new chloride-free monomeric methyllithium complex [(Me3TACN)LiCH3], ligated by an azacrown ether, are assessed by comparison with a halide-contaminated variant and monomeric lithium chloride [(Me3TACN)LiCl], further emphasizing the effect of halide impurities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deep Learning&#8208;Enhanced Potentiometric Aptasensing with Magneto&#8208;Controlled Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioelectronic sensors that report charge changes of a biomolecule on target binding enable direct and sensitive analyte detection, but remains a big challenge for potentiometric measurement, mainly due to the Debye Length limitations and the need for molecular&#8208;level platforms. Here we report on a magneto&#8208;controlled potentiometric method to directly and sensitively measure the target&#8208;binding induced charge change of DNA aptamer assembled on magnetic beads using a polymeric membrane potentiometric ion sensor. The potentiometric responses of the negatively charged aptamer, serving as a receptor and reporter, were dynamically controlled and modulated by applying a magnetic field. Based on a potentiometric array, this non&#8208;equilibrium measurement technique combined with deep learning algorithms allows for rapidly and reliably classifying and quantifying diverse small molecules using antibiotics as models. This potentiometric strategy opens new modalities for sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>High Power&#8208; and Energy&#8208;density Supercapacitors through the Chlorine Respiration Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supercapacitor represents an important electrical energy storage technology with high&#8208;power performance and superior cyclability. However, currently commercialized supercapacitors still suffer limited energy densities. Here we report an unprecedentedly respiring supercapacitor with chlorine gas iteratively re&#8208;inspires in porous carbon materials, that improves the energy density by orders of magnitude. Both electrochemical results and theoretical calculations show that porous carbon with pore size around 3 nm delivers the best chlorine evolution and adsorption performance. The respiring supercapacitor with multi&#8208;wall carbon nanotube as the cathode and NaTi2(PO4)3 as the anode can store specific energy of 33 Wh/kg with negligible capacity loss over 30,000 cycles. The energy density can be further improved to 53 Wh/kg by replacing NaTi2(PO4)3 with zinc anode. Furthermore, thanks to the extraordinary reaction kinetics of chlorine gas, this respiring supercapacitor performs an extremely high&#8208;power density of 50,000 W/kg.</dc:description>

         <title>Decorating Single&#8208;Atomic Mn Sites with FeMn Clusters to Boost Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of electron distribution of single&#8208;atomic metal sites by atomic clusters is an effective strategy to boost their intrinsic activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein we report the construction of single&#8208;atomic Mn sites decorated with atomic clusters by an innovative combination of post&#8208;adsorption and secondary pyrolysis. The X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy confirms the formation of Mn sites via Mn&#8208;N4 coordination bonding to FeMn atomic clusters (FeMnac/Mn&#8208;N4C), which has been demonstrated theoretically to be conducive to the adsorption of molecular O2 and the break of O&#8208;O bond during the ORR process. Benefiting from the structural features above, the FeMnac/Mn&#8208;N4C catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity with half&#8208;wave potential of 0.79 V in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.90 V in 0.1 M KOH as well as preeminent Zn&#8208;air battery performance. Such synthetic strategy may open up a route to construct highly active catalysts with tunable atomic structures for diverse applications.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Light Powered Asymmetric Hydrogel Nanomotors for Enhanced Immunochemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanomotors are appealing drug carriers, and the strength of the propelling force is important for their motion capability. Though high motion efficiency has been achieved with 808 nm light driven Janus&#8208;structured noble metal nanomotors, the NIR&#8208;I light penetration depth and material biocompatibility limit their broad application. Herein, we develop a 1064 nm NIR&#8208;II light driven asymmetric hydrogel nanomotor (AHNM) with high motion capability and load it with doxorubicin for enhanced immunochemotherapy. Magnetic field assisted photopolymerization generates an asymmetric distribution of Fe3O4@Cu9S8 nanoparticles in the AHNM, producing self&#8208;thermophoresis as driving force under NIR&#8208;II irradiation. The AHNM is also functionalized with dopamine for the capture and retention of tumor&#8208;associated antigens to boost immune activation. The as&#8208;obtained NIR&#8208;II light driven AHNM has a high tumor tissue penetration capability and enhances immunochemotherapy, providing a promising strategy for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogenization of Salen Metal Molecular Catalysts in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating a molecular catalyst with a light harvester into a photocatalyst is an effective strategy for solar light conversion. However, it is challenging to establish a crystallized framework with well&#8208;organized connections that favour charge separation and transfer. Herein, we report the heterogenization of a Salen metal complex molecular catalyst into a rigid covalent organic framework (COF) through covalent linkage with the light&#8208;harvesting unit of pyrene for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The chemically conjugated bonds between the two units contribute to fast photogenerated electron transfer and thereby promote the proton reduction reaction. The Salen cobalt&#8208;based COF showed the best hydrogen evolution activity (1378 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1), which is superior to the previously reported nonnoble metal based COF photocatalysts. This work provides a strategy to construct atom&#8208;efficient photocatalysts by the heterogenization of molecular catalysts into covalent organic frameworks.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A non&#8208;aromatic expanded carbaporphyrinoid, incorporating two built&#8208;in 2,7&#8208;pyrenylene moieties was synthesized. The intrinsically labile topographic structure was demonstrated by proton&#8208;triggered conformational changes between the figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight and quasi&#8208;M&#246;bius conformers. Upon treatment with Pd(OAc)  2  , the reaction produces two bis&#8208;Pd  II  complexes with distinct coordination modes. Metal coordination serves to fix the oligopyrrolic macrocyclic frame&#8208;works with the net result that both bis&#8208;Pd  II  complexes could be resolved by chiral high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The isolated enantiomers showed considerable configurational stability and persistent chiroptical properties as evidenced by the intense response in the circular dichroism (CD) spectra from 300&#8208;850 nm and the record high absorption dissymmetry factors (  g  abs  of up to 0.038) seen in the near&#8208;infrared spectral region. In addition, the mutual interconversion of the enantiomers was found to be stereospecific and to favor the more stable isomers in the presence of the weakly acidic solvent deuterated chloroform.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) have been attracting extensive research interests in designing advanced nanomaterials, while their precise control is still in the infancy stage. Herein, we have reported a well&#8208;defined PtBiPbNiCo hexagonal nanoplates (HEA HPs) as high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Structure analysis decodes that the HEA HP is constructed with PtBiPb medium&#8208;entropy core and PtBiNiCo high&#8208;entropy shell. Significantly, the HEA HPs can reach the specific and mass activities of 27.2 mA cm&#8722;2 and 7.1 A mgPt&#8722;1 for formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR), being the record catalyst ever achieved in Pt&#8208;based catalysts, and can realize the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) power density (321.2 mW cm&#8722;2) in fuel cell. Further experimental and theoretical analyses collectively evidence that the hexagonal intermetallic core/atomic layer shell structure and multi&#8208;element synergy greatly promote the direct dehydrogenation pathway of formic acid molecule and suppress the formation of CO*.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Decarbonylation of Oxetanone and Azetidinone: Spectroscopy, Computational Models, and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoexcitation of cyclic ketones leads to the expulsion of carbon monoxide and a mixture of products derived from diradical intermediates. Here we show that synthetic utility of this process is improved if strained heterocyclic ketones are used. Photochemistry of 3&#8208;oxetanone and N&#8208;Boc&#8208;3&#8208;azetidinone has not been previously described. Decarbonylation of these 4&#8208;membered rings proceeds through a step&#8208;wise Norrish type I cleavage of the C&#8211;C bond from the singlet excited state. Ylides derived from both compounds are high&#8208;energy species that are kinetically stable long enough to undergo [3+2] cycloaddition with a variety of alkenes and produce substituted tetrahydrofurans and pyrrolidines. The reaction has a sufficiently wide scope to produce scaffolds that were either previously inaccessible or difficult to synthesize, thereby providing experimental access to new chemical space.</dc:description>

         <title>Monomer and Excimer Emission in a Conformational and Stacking&#8208;Adaptable Molecular System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A design strategy combining the molecular conformations, alkyl chain lengths, and charge transfer effect is developed to obtain the conformational and stacking&#8208;adaptable donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;&#960; type molecules for precisely regulating the monomer and excimer emission in a single luminous platform under different environments. These fluorophores can exhibit bright monomer emissions when they are in the dispersed state based on their planar conformation. However, when the luminous molecules with short alkyl side chains are in the crystalline state, their molecular conformation can become distorted, further inducing strong intermolecular interactions and staggered &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking for bright excimer emission. More importantly, their dispersed and aggregated states can be reversibly regulated in a phase&#8208;change fatty acid matrix, to achieve temperature&#8208;responsive fluorescence for temperature monitoring and advanced information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Visualization of Atomic Structure in Multivariate MOFs for Guiding Electrocatalysts Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct utilization of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has attracted increasing interests. Herein, we employ the low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase contrast&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM) technique to visualize the atomic structure of multivariate MOFs (MTV&#8208;MOFs) for guiding the structural design of bulk MOFs for efficient OER. The iDPC&#8208;STEM images revealed that incorporating Fe3+ or ATA into Ni&#8208;BDC can introduce inhomogeneous lattice strain that weaken the coordination bonds, which can be selectively cleaved via a mild heat treatment to simultaneously generate coordinately unsaturated metal sites, conductive Ni@C and hierarchical porous structure. Thus, excellent OER activity with current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm&#8208;2 are achieved over the defective MOFs at small overpotentials of 286 mV and 365 mV, respectively, which is superior to the commercial RuO2 catalyst and most of the other MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Fluxional Ga Single Atom Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise design and tuning of the micro&#8208;atomic structure of single atom catalysts (SACs) can help efficiently adapt complex catalytic systems. Herein, we inventively found that when the active center of the main group element gallium (Ga) is downsized to the atomic level, whose characteristic has significant differences from conventional bulk and rigid Ga catalysts. The Ga SACs with a P, S atomic coordination environment display specific flow properties, showing CO products with FE of ~92% at &#8208;0.3 V vs. RHE in electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Theoretical simulations demonstrate that the adaptive dynamic transition of Ga optimizes the adsorption energy of the *COOH intermediate and renews the active sites in time, leading to excellent CO2RR selectivity and stability. This liquid single atom catalysts system with dynamic interfaces lays the foundation for future exploration of synthesis and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Mass Transport in Electrocatalysis Down to Sub&#8208;5nm Through Nanoscale Grade Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nano and single&#8208;atom catalysis open new possibilities of producing green hydrogen (H2) by water electrolysis. However, for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which occurs at a characteristic reaction rate proportional to the potential, the fast generation of H2 nanobubbles at atomic&#8208;scale interfaces often leads to the blockage of active sites. Herein, a nanoscale grade&#8208;separation strategy is proposed to tackle mass&#8208;transport problem by utilizing ordered three&#8208;dimensional (3d) interconnected sub&#8208;5 nm pores. The results reveal that 3d criss&#8208;crossing mesopores with grade separation allow efficient diffusion of H2 bubbles along the interconnected channels. After the support of ultrafine ruthenium (Ru), the 3d mesopores are on a superior level to two&#8208;dimensional system at maximizing the catalyst performance and the obtained Ru catalyst outperforms most of the other HER catalysts. This work provides a potential route to fine&#8208;tuning few&#8208;nanometer mass transport during water electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Cascade Reactions by a Cobalt&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Synergistic Nanocatalytic Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;single&#8208;atom nanozyme, with Co&#8722;N coordination on N&#8208;doped porous carbon (Co&#8208;SAs@NC), displayed tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive cascade enzymatic activities with both catalase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;like properties, specifically generating cytotoxic superoxide radicals from overexpressed H2O2. The nanocatalytic therapy led to a remarkably enhanced antitumor effect in vivo by further integration with doxorubicin.







Abstract
Nanocatalytic therapy, involving the nanozyme&#8208;triggered production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), has demonstrated potential in tumor therapy, but nanozymes still face challenges of activity and specificity that compromise the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we report a strategy based on a single&#8208;atom nanozyme to initiate cascade enzymatic reactions in the TME for tumor&#8208;specific treatment. The cobalt&#8208;single&#8208;atom nanozyme, with Co&#8722;N coordination on N&#8208;doped porous carbon (Co&#8208;SAs@NC), displays catalase&#8208;like activity that decomposes cellular endogenous H2O2 to produce O2, and subsequent oxidase&#8208;like activity that converts O2 into cytotoxic superoxide radicals to efficiently kill tumor cells. By incorporation with doxorubicin, the therapy achieves a significantly enhanced antitumor effect in vivo. Our findings show that cascade TME&#8208;specific catalytic therapy combined with chemotherapy is a promising strategy for efficient tumor therapy.

         <title>Alkaline Tolerant Antifreezing Additive Enabling Aqueous Zn||Ni Battery Operating at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a stable electrolyte by using alkaline tolerant antifreezing additive to realize the antifreezing property and the stable Zn anode in alkaline condition. Leveraging the high reversibility and good antifreezing property, the fabricated Zn||Ni battery can endure low working temperature even down to &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C with good electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Alkaline aqueous batteries such as the Zn||Ni batteries have attracted substantial interests due to their merits of high energy density, high safety and low cost. However, the freeze of aqueous electrolyte and the poor cycling stability in alkaline condition have hindered their operation in subzero conditions. Herein, we construct a stable aqueous electrolyte with lowest freezing point down to &#8722;90&#8201;&#176;C by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as alkaline tolerant antifreezing additive into 1&#8197;M KOH solution. Meanwhile, we find the DMSO can also retard Zn anode corrosion and prevent Zn dendrite formation in alkaline condition, which enables the Zn plating/stripping over 700&#8197;h cycle at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The fabricated Zn||Ni battery can endure low working temperature even down to &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C and its dischage capacity retains 84.1&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, 60.6&#8201;% at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C at 0.5&#8197;C. Meanwhile, it can maintain 600 cycles with a specific capacity retention of 86.5&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C at 2&#8197;C.

The rSAM enzymes are known to catalyze diverse crosslink formation in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Here, we develop a small peptide and enzyme co&#8208;occurrence analysis workflow (SPECO) to reveal the untapped biosynthetic landscape of rSAM&#8208;modified RiPPs and characterize cyclophane&#8208;forming enzymes that catalyze various tyrosine/histidine&#8208;aliphatic side chain crosslinks.







Abstract
Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) represent one of the largest but primarily underexplored natural product families in bacteria. The genetically encoded nature of RiPPs simplifies the prediction and prioritization of their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). We report a small peptide and enzyme co&#8208;occurrence analysis workflow (SPECO), which allowed us to identify 32&#8201;220 prospective rSAM&#8208;catalyzed RiPP BGCs from 161&#8201;954 bacterial genomes and prioritize 25 families with new biosynthetic architectures or precursor patterns. We characterized three new enzymes that respectively catalyze cysteine&#8208;glycine (BlaB), histidine&#8208;aliphatic side chain (ScaB), and tyrosine/histidine&#8208;arginine (VguB) cross&#8208;links. The cyclophane&#8208;forming enzyme ScaB exhibits broad substrate selectivity, allowing it to catalyze diverse triceptide formation. These results demonstrate the strength of the SPECO workflow in discovering new enzymes for peptide macrocyclization.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer Parent Core Engineering for Six&#8208;Level System Lasing Toward 900 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A six&#8208;level system lasing toward 900&#8197;nm was achieved with a low lasing threshold of 27.4&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 through engineering of the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) of the parent core. This work demonstrates that extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system of the ESIPT parent core can effectively enhance the second proton transfer process in a cascaded double ESIPT system.







Abstract
Organic molecules which can undergo excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process have been considered as ideal gain materials for near&#8208;infrared organic lasers owing to their effective four&#8208;level systems. However, extending lasing wavelength beyond 800&#8197;nm with present ESIPT&#8208;active gain materials is still in challenge. Herein, we established a molecular design strategy that operates via extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system of the ESIPT parent core to enhance the cascaded double ESIPT process and thus to achieve the red&#8208;shifted six&#8208;level system lasing. Concretely, a model molecule with 1,9&#8208;dihydroxyanthracene as the ESIPT parent core was designed and synthesized, which was proved to undergo twice cascaded ESIPT processes while the 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene&#8208;based analogue can only undergo once ESIPT process based on DFT calculations and ultrafast dynamics analyses. Finally, a six&#8208;level system lasing toward 900&#8197;nm was achieved with a low threshold of 27.4&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Gold Alloy Catalyzes the Aerobic Oxidation of Formic Acid for Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the catalytic mechanism of formate oxidase, a platinum&#8208;gold alloy simulating the catalytic function of formic acid oxidase was designed. Hydrogen peroxide can be directly synthesized by aerobic oxidation of formic acid without complex equipment and an additional energy supply.







Abstract
On&#8208;site hydrogen peroxide production through electrocatalytic and photocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions has recently attracted broad research interest. However, practical applications have thus far been plagued by the low activity and the requirement of complex equipment. Here, inspired by the process of biological hydrogen peroxide synthesis catalyzed by enzymes, we report a Pt&#8208;Au alloy to mimic the catalytic function of natural formate oxidase for hydrogen peroxide synthesis through aerobic oxidation of formic acid. The mass activity of the Pt&#8208;Au alloy is three times higher than that of formate oxidase. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the efficient dehydrogenation of formic acid and the high selectivity of the subsequent reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide account for the high hydrogen peroxide productivity. In addition, the formic acid aqueous solution provides an acidic environment, which is conducive to the utilization of the in situ generated hydrogen peroxide for oxidation reactions, including C&#8722;H bond oxidation and sterilization.

         <title>Spontaneous Assembly and Three&#8208;Dimensional Stacking of Antiaromatic 5,15&#8208;Dioxaporphyrin on HOPG</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spontaneous assembly of antiaromatic meso&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl&#8208;substituted 5,15&#8208;dioxaporphyrin (DOP&#8208;1) has been studied at the liquid&#8208;solid interface to elucidate its polymorphism in a monolayer and the facile formation of the stacked layer. The study of the intrinsic electronic structures of the stacked bilayer by scanning tunneling spectroscopy revealed a narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap compared to the monolayer, thus suggesting significant molecular orbital interactions.







Abstract
Antiaromatic compounds have recently received considerable attention because of their novel properties such as narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps and facile formation of mutual stacking. Here, the spontaneous assembly of antiaromatic meso&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl&#8208;substituted 5,15&#8208;dioxaporphyrin (DOP&#8208;1) is scrutinized at the liquid&#8208;solid interface by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Polymorphism in monolayers characterized by the orthogonal and parallel assemblies is found at the low concentration of 0.05&#8197;mM. The parallel assembly is more stable and dominantly formed at higher concentrations. Aggregation was observed at concentrations &gt;0.2&#8197;mM, and the STM images of the aggregates implied the formation of stacked layers. The intrinsic electronic structures of the mutually stacked bilayer generated by applying an electric pulse to the monolayer were probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy to reveal the narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap by about 20&#8201;% compared with the monolayer, thus suggesting significant molecular orbital interactions.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Spirosilabicyclohexenes by Asymmetric Dual Ring Expansion of Spirosilabicyclobutane with Alkynes</title>

Spirosilabicyclobutanes undergo asymmetric dual ring expansion with alkynes to provide homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208;disubstituted spirosilabicyclohexenes, possessing axially chiral 6/6&#8208;silaspirane framework, in good yields with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Silaspiranes have attracted particular attention due to their chiral spiro&#8208;silicon center, which serves as an ideal carbon isostere and can endow spiro&#8208;analogs with distinct properties. Distinct from previously reported cyclization or cycloaddition strategies to form 5/5&#8208;silaspiranes, we report herein the asymmetric dual ring expansion of spirosilabicyclobutanes with alkynes to synthesize axially chiral spirosilabicyclohexenes bearing a novel 6/6&#8208;silaspirane framework. DFT (density functional theory) calculations provide the deep insight into the origin of the high enantioselectivity controlled by the sterically demanding binaphthyl phosphoramidite ligand. Preliminary studies of chiroptical properties indicate that one of the spirosilabicyclohexene analogs exhibit fluorescence emission, Cotton effects and CPL (circularly polarized luminescence) activity.

         <title>Constructing Stable Anion&#8208;Tuned Electrode/Electrolyte Interphase on High&#8208;Voltage Na3V2(PO4)2F3 Cathode for Thermally&#8208;Modulated Fast&#8208;Charging Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable anion&#8208;tuned and solvent&#8208;derived electrode/electrolyte interphase with faster interfacial Na+ transport kinetics is established by tuning the ion&#8208;solvent configuration of electrolyte solvation structure, which contributes to thermally&#8208;modulated fast&#8208;charging batteries having longer cycle life.







Abstract
Constructing stable electrode/electrolyte interphase with fast interfacial kinetics is vital for fast&#8208;charging batteries. Herein, we investigate the interphase that forms between a high&#8208;voltage Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode and the electrolytes consisting of 3.0, 1.0, or 0.3&#8197;M NaClO4 in an organic carbonate solvent (47.5&#8201;:&#8201;47.5&#8201;:&#8201;5 mixture of EC: PC: FEC) during charging up to 4.5&#8197;V at 55&#8201;&#176;C. It is found that a higher anion/solvent ratio in electrolyte solvation structure induces anion&#8208;dominated interphase containing more inorganic species and more anion derivatives (CxClOy), which leads to a larger interfacial Na+ transport resistance and more unfavorable gas evolution. In comparison, a low anion/solvent ratio derives stable anion&#8208;tuned interphase that enables better interfacial kinetics and cycle ability. Importantly, the performance of a failed cathode is restored by triggering the decomposition of CxClOy species. This work elucidates the role of tuning interphase in fast&#8208;charging batteries.

         <title>Direct TEM Observation of Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Heteroatom Incorporation into a Zeolite Framework: Towards Microscopic Design of Zeolite Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In zeolite YNU&#8208;2, point vacancies and titanium active sites at specific framework positions act as cooperative binding sites. Titanium&#8208;substituted YNU&#8208;2 (Ti&#8208;YNU&#8208;2) with a pre&#8208;designed titanium distribution, was synthesized from YNU&#8208;2 by vacancy&#8208;mediated heteroatom incorporation. Transmission electron microscopy enables direct imaging at atomic scale and provided precise structural information to understand the post&#8208;synthesis process.







Abstract
Incorporating hetero&#8208;metal&#8208;atom, e.g., titanium, into zeolite frameworks can enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity in oxidation reactions. However, the rational design of zeolites containing titanium at specific sites is difficult because the precise atomic structure during synthesis process remained unclear. Here, a titanosilicate with predictable titanium distribution was synthesized by mediating vacancies in a defective MSE&#8208;type zeolite precursor, based on a pre&#8208;designed synthetic route including modification of vacancies followed by titanium insertion, where electron microscopy (EM) plays a key role at each step resolving the atomic structure. Point defects including vacancies in the precursor and titanium incorporated into the vacancy&#8208;related positions have been directly observed. The results provide insights into the role of point defects in zeolites towards the rational synthesis of zeolites with desired microscopic arrangement of catalytically active sites.

         <title>Boosting Ethane/Ethylene Separation by MOFs through the Amino&#8208;Functionalization of Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By virtue of a pore engineering strategy based on isoreticular chemistry, an amino&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with suitable pore confinement and more binding sites improved the ethane/ethylene separation performance compared to the parent MOF.







Abstract
Adsorption technology based on ethane&#8208;selective materials is a promising alternative to energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation for separating ethane (C2H6) and ethylene (C2H4). We employed a pore engineering strategy to tune the pore environment of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) through organic functional groups and boosted the C2H6/C2H4 separation of the MOF. Introduction of amino (&#8722;NH2) groups into Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76 not only decreased pore sizes but also facilitated multiple guest&#8208;host interactions in confined pores. The NH2&#8208;functionalized Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76(NH2) has increased C2H6 and C2H4 uptakes and C2H6/C2H4 selectivity. The results of experimental and simulated transient breakthroughs reveal that Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76(NH2) has significantly improved one&#8208;step separation performance for C2H6/C2H4 mixtures with a high C2H4 (&gt;99.95&#8201;%) productivity of 17.66&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 compared to 7.53&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 by Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76, resulting from the suitable pore confinement and accessible &#8722;NH2 groups on pore surfaces.

The results of experimental and simulated transient breakthroughs reveal that Tb-MOF-76(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has significantly improved one-step separation performance for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures with a high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&amp;gt;99.95&#8201;%) productivity of 17.66&#8197;L&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; compared to 7.53&#8197;L&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; by Tb-MOF-76, resulting from the suitable pore confinement and accessible &#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups on pore surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 (Ln=Sm, Dy, Yb): A Mixed&#8208;Ligand Pathway to New Lanthanide(III) Multifunctional Materials Featuring Nonlinear Optical and Magnetic Anisotropy Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed&#8208;ligand gateway gives new lanthanide materials with multiple functionalities which often do not coexist. Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 materials are capable of generating coherent light through the second&#8208;harmonic generation and exhibiting magnetic anisotropy facilitated by large spin&#8208;orbit coupling. This result shares new ideas for harmonizing optical and magnetic properties in single systems at the atomic level.







Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up assembly of optically nonlinear and magnetically anisotropic lanthanide materials involving precisely placed spin carriers and optimized metal&#8208;ligand coordination offers a potential route to developing electronic architectures for coherent radiation generation and spin&#8208;based technologies, but the chemical design historically has been extremely hard to achieve. To address this, we developed a worthwhile avenue for creating new noncentrosymmetric chiral Ln3+ materials Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 (Ln=Sm, Dy, Yb) by mixed&#8208;ligand design. The materials exhibit phase&#8208;matching nonlinear optical responses, elucidating the feasibility of the heteroanionic strategy. Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 displays paramagnetic property with strong magnetic anisotropy facilitated by large spin&#8208;orbit coupling. This study demonstrates a new chemical pathway for creating previously unknown polar chiral magnets with multiple functionalities.

         <title>The Essential Role of Water Molecules in the Reaction Mechanism of Protein O&#8208;Fucosyltransferase 2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
PoFUT2 is an inverting glycosyltransferase that fucosylates TSR repeats of group 1 and 2. By applying computational methodologies, it has been found that PoFUT2 follows a pure SN2 mechanism in which water molecules play an essential role in the catalysis. Recognition of the TSR repeats by direct and water&#8208;mediated interactions, together with the role of water molecules around the catalytic center, constitute the driving force of the process.







Abstract
Protein O&#8208;fucosyltransferase 2 (PoFUT2) is an inverting glycosyltransferase (GT) that fucosylates thrombospondin repeats (TSRs) from group 1 and 2. PoFUT2 recognizes a large and diverse number of TSRs through a dynamic network of water&#8208;mediated interactions. By X&#8208;ray structural studies of C. elegans PoFUT2 complexed to a TSR of group 2, we demonstrate that this GT recognizes similarly the 3D structure of TSRs from both groups 1 and 2. Its active site is highly exposed to the solvent, suggesting that water molecules might also play an essential role in the fucosylation mechanism. We applied QM/MM methods using human PoFUT2 as a model, and found that HsPoFUT2 follows a classical SN2 reaction mechanism in which water molecules contribute to a great extent in facilitating the release of the leaving pyrophosphate unit, causing the H transfer from the acceptor nucleophile (Thr/Ser) to the catalytic base, which is the last event in the reaction. This demonstrates the importance of water molecules not only in recognition of the ligands but also in catalysis.

         <title>The Dynamic Formation from Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks of High&#8208;Density Platinum Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Metal&#8208;Metal Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of metal cations in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) via a cation exchange process is governed by the Hard&#8208;Soft Acid&#8208;Base (HSAB) principle. During pyrolysis, the evolution of first&#8208;shell Pt&#8208;ligand coordination determines the formation of the Pt&#8722;Pt second&#8208;shell coordination, which promotes the immobilization of Pt atoms as high&#8208;density single&#8208;atom catalysts in the Co3O4 host.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) hold great promise for highly efficient heterogeneous catalysis, yet the practical applications require the development of high&#8208;density active sites with flexible geometric structures. The lack of understanding in the dynamic formation process of single atoms in the host framework has been plaguing the controllable synthesis of next generation SACs. Here using Co&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as a starting substrate, we fully elucidated the formation of high&#8208;density Pt single atoms with inter&#8208;site interactions in derived Co3O4 host. The cation exchange process and dynamic evolution of Pt&#8722;Pt interactions, organic ligand cleavage and Pt&#8208;oxygen coordination formation during the pyrolysis process have been unambiguously interpreted by a series of in situ/ex situ spectroscopic measurements and theoretical computation. These findings would direct the synthesis of high&#8208;density SACs with metal&#8208;metal interactions, which demonstrate significantly enhanced structural flexibility and catalytic properties.

         <title>Next Generation Opto&#8208;Jasplakinolides Enable Local Remodeling of Actin Networks
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of actin dynamics in biology requires tools that can be controlled with high spatial and temporal resolution. A new photoresponsive and fast&#8208;relaxing jasplakinolide (neo&#8208;optojasp) allows for the stabilization of F&#8208;actin upon irradiation with blue&#8208;green light and provides excellent spatiotemporal control. neo&#8208;Optojasp can be useful for studying actin dynamics with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision.







Abstract
The natural product jasplakinolide is widely used to stabilize F&#8208;actin. Based on extensive structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, we have developed a new generation of photoswitchable jasplakinolides that feature rationally designed red&#8208;shifted azobenzene photoswitches. Our lead compound, nOJ, can be activated with longer wavelengths in the visible range (e.g. 440&#8211;475&#8197;nm) and rapidly returns to its inactive state through thermal relaxation. nOJ enables the reversible control of F&#8208;actin dynamics, as shown through live&#8208;cell imaging, cell migration, and cell proliferation assays. Short, local irradiation with blue light resulted in highly localized and reversible actin aggregation with subcellular precision. Our optical tool can be useful in diverse fields to study actin dynamics with excellent spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>Vibration&#8208;Regulated Multi&#8208;State Long&#8208;Lived Emission from Star&#8208;Shaped Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;state long&#8208;lived emission has been obtained by regulating the molecular motions of star&#8208;shaped molecules. Reverse intersystem crossing assisted by the T2 state of the star&#8208;shaped molecules leads to thermally activated delayed fluorescence in solution and the solid state. Suppressing the molecular motions of the dye in a polymer leads to ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence.







Abstract
How to utilize molecular vibration to tune triplet&#8208;involved emissions in multiple states is highly challenging. Here, star&#8208;shaped triphenylamine derivatives have been employed as model systems to understand how molecular vibration affects thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emissions in multiple states. Nonplanar, star&#8208;shaped conformations allow molecules to generate appropriate vibrations in the solution state, facilitating vibronic coupling between their T1 and T2 states to generate effective TADF. More importantly, a relatively dispersed state can allow the molecules to efficiently vibrate in the solid state, and a crystalline environment further promotes a more efficient TADF. Lastly, by suppressing molecular vibration to inhibit the TADF, ultra&#8208;long RTP was observed upon doping these molecules into polymers. These molecules can be used in information encryption and storage as well as bioimaging.

         <title>Highly Stable Orange&#8208;Red Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescent CsCdCl3:Mn2+ Perovskite Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn2+&#8208;doped CsCdCl3 perovskite luminescent crystals with tunable afterglow time, high efficiency and stability were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. CsCdCl3&#8201;:&#8201;Mn2+ shows the longest afterglow time of 1480&#8197;s and the highest PLQY of 91.4&#8201;%. CsCdCl3&#8201;:&#8201;Mn2+ maintained over 90&#8201;% of the PL intensity at 423&#8197;K, and the PL remains about 80&#8201;% after soaking in water for 55&#8197;days.







Abstract
Halide perovskite has been widely studied as a new generation of photoelectronic materials. However, their thermal and humidity&#8208;induced emission quenching have greatly limited their utility and reliability. Here, we report a hexagonal Mn2+&#8208;doped CsCdCl3 perovskite crystal that possesses stable photoluminescence (PL) at both high temperature and humidity. The room temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) of the single crystals lasts up to 1480&#8197;s and can be adjusted by changing the concentration of Mn2+ ion doping. The characteristic emission of d&#8208;d transition of Mn2+ is realized, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is up to 91.4&#8201;%, it can maintain more than 90&#8201;% of the initial PL spectral integral area at 150&#8201;&#176;C (423&#8197;K). High humid stability PL can be achieved more than 75&#8201;% of the initial PL intensity after 55&#8197;days of immersion in water. These excellent properties show the application prospect of the LPL material in lighting indication and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput Screening of an Artificial Metalloenzyme using Double Emulsions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial metalloenzyme was screened in vivo using a high&#8208;throughput microfluidics&#8208;based assay. Single E. coli cells expressing streptavidin were encapsulated in double emulsion droplets together with a fluorogenic substrate and a cofactor catalyzing the reaction to yield a fluorescent product. Using this method, a 400&#8208;member library was screened, and the same hits found previously in a 96&#8208;well plate assay were identified.







Abstract
The potential for ultrahigh&#8208;throughput compartmentalization renders droplet microfluidics an attractive tool for the directed evolution of enzymes. Importantly, it ensures maintenance of the phenotype&#8208;genotype linkage, enabling reliable identification of improved mutants. Herein, we report an approach for ultrahigh&#8208;throughput screening of an artificial metalloenzyme in double emulsion droplets (DEs) using commercially available fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorters (FACS). This protocol was validated by screening a 400 double&#8208;mutant streptavidin library for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed deallylation of an alloc&#8208;protected aminocoumarin. The most active variants, identified by next&#8208;generation sequencing, were in good agreement with hits obtained using a 96&#8208;well plate procedure. These findings pave the way for the systematic implementation of FACS for the directed evolution of (artificial) enzymes and will significantly expand the accessibility of ultrahigh&#8208;throughput DE screening protocols.

         <title>Biosynthetic Elucidation and Structural Revision of Brevione&#8197;E: Characterization of the Key Dioxygenase for Pathway Branching from Setosusin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biosynthetic elucidation and structural revision of the fungal meroterpenoid brevione&#8197;E were achieved. The brevione&#8197;E pathway involves dihydrotropone synthesis via the &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase BrvJ. BrvJ is also the key enzyme responsible for the pathway branching from setosusin biosynthesis, which involves a BrvJ homologue, SetK. Amino acid residues that account for their product selectivity were also identified.







Abstract
Brevione&#8197;E (1) is a fungal hexacyclic meroditerpenoid with unique oxepane and cycloheptenone moieties. In this study, we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 and elucidated its biosynthetic pathway via heterologous expression of the biosynthetic genes and in vitro enzymatic reactions. Surprisingly, reexamination of the structure of 1 revealed a substituted tetrahydrofuran ring instead of the previously proposed oxepane system. Moreover, we determined that cycloheptenone synthesis involves skeletal rearrangement catalyzed by the &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase BrvJ. BrvJ is highly homologous to SetK, which engages in the biosynthesis of another fungal metabolite, setosusin, and accepts the same substrate as BrvJ but performs only simple hydroxylation. Finally, we identified the key amino acid residues critical for product selectivity of BrvJ and SetK, providing insight into how the biosynthesis pathways of 1 and setosusin diverge and how fungi diversify natural products.

         <title>Quantifying Reductive Amination in Nonenzymatic Amino Acid Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Why does biochemical amino acid synthesis proceed the way it does? Kinetic and mechanistic experiments with a model hydride donor were used to determine the intrinsic electrophilic reactivities of keto acids in reduction and reductive amination reactions. Comparing the nonenzymatic reactivity trends with those found in biology provides new insight into the structure of amino acid metabolism.







Abstract
Amino acid biosynthesis initiates with the reductive amination of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate with ammonia to produce glutamate. However, the other &#945;&#8208;keto acids derived from the glyoxylate and Krebs cycles are converted into amino acids by transamination, rather than by reductive amination. Why is only one amino acid synthesized by reductive amination and not the others? To explore this question, we quantified the inherent reactivities of keto acids in nonenzymatic reduction and reductive amination by using BH3CN&#8722; as a model nucleophile. Biological &#945;&#8208;keto acids were found to show pronounced nonenzymatic reactivity differences for the formation of amino acids (&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&lt;oxaloacetate&#8776;pyruvate&#8810;glyoxylate). Accordingly, the flow of ammonia passes through the least reactive &#945;&#8208;keto acid of the Krebs cycle. One possible explanation for this choice is the position of the corresponding amino acid, glutamate, at the top of the thermodynamic landscape for subsequent transamination reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Amino acid biosynthesis initiates with the reductive amination of &#945;-ketoglutarate with ammonia to produce glutamate. However, the other &#945;-keto acids derived from the glyoxylate and Krebs cycles are converted into amino acids by transamination, rather than by reductive amination. Why is only one amino acid synthesized by reductive amination and not the others? To explore this question, we quantified the inherent reactivities of keto acids in nonenzymatic reduction and reductive amination by using BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as a model nucleophile. Biological &#945;-keto acids were found to show pronounced nonenzymatic reactivity differences for the formation of amino acids (&#945;-ketoglutarate&amp;lt;oxaloacetate&#8776;pyruvate&#8810;glyoxylate). Accordingly, the flow of ammonia passes through the least reactive &#945;-keto acid of the Krebs cycle. One possible explanation for this choice is the position of the corresponding amino acid, glutamate, at the top of the thermodynamic landscape for subsequent transamination reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Overcoming Hypoxia&#8208;Induced Ferroptosis Resistance via a 19F/1H&#8208;MRI Traceable Core&#8208;Shell Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfluorocarbon@MnOx core&#8208;shell nanostructure for overcoming the tumor microenvironment hypoxia&#8208;induced ferroptosis resistance via direct delivery of oxygen into the tumor is presented. Using this nanoplatform, activatable 19F&#8208;MRI/1H&#8208;MRI imaging of ferroptosis initiation is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Lipid peroxides accumulation induced ferroptosis is an effective cell death pathway for cancer therapy. However, the hypoxic condition of tumor microenvironment significantly suppresses the efficacy of ferroptosis. Here, we design a novel nanoplatform to overcome hypoxia&#8208;induced ferroptosis resistance. Specifically, we synthesize a novel kind of perfluorocarbon (PFOB)@manganese oxide (MnOx) core&#8208;shell nanoparticles (PM&#8208;CS NPs). Owing to the good carrier of O2 as fuel, PM&#8208;CS NPs can induce higher level of ROS generation, lipid peroxidation and GSH depletion, as well as lower activity of GPX4, compared with MnOx NPs alone. Moreover, the supplement of O2 can relieve tumor hypoxia to break down the storage of intracellular lipid droplets and increase expression of ACSL4 (a symbol for ferroptosis sensitivity). Furthermore, upon stimulus of GSH or acidity, PM&#8208;CS NPs exhibit the &#8220;turn on&#8221; 19F&#8208;MRI signal and activatable T1/T2&#8208;MRI contrast for correlating with the release of Mn. Finally, PM&#8208;CS NPs exert high cancer inhibition rate for ferroptosis based therapy via synergetic combination of O2&#8208;mediated enhancement of key pathways of ferroptosis.

         <title>Switchable Metal Sites in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework MFM&#8208;300(Sc): Lewis Acid Catalysis Driven by Metal&#8211;Hemilabile Linker Bond Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional catalytic activity was demonstrated for the Strecker reaction using a saturated ScIII&#8208;based MOF known as MFM&#8208;300(Sc). This activity was possible due to metal&#8208;hemilabile linker bond to create an intermittent free ScIII site.







Abstract
Uncommon reversible guest&#8208;induced metal&#8208;hemilabile linker bond dynamics in MOF MFM&#8208;300(Sc) was unraveled to switch on/switch off catalytic open metal sites. The catalytic activity of this MOF with non&#8208;permanent open metal sites was demonstrated using a model Strecker hydrocyanation reaction as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. Conclusively, the catalytic activity was evidenced to be fully reversible, preserving the conversion performance and structure integrity of MFM&#8208;300(Sc) over multiple cycles. These experimental findings were corroborated by quantum&#8208;calculations that revealed a reaction mechanism driven by the Sc&#8208;open metal sites. This discovery paves the way towards the design of new effective and easily regenerable heterogeneous MOF catalysts integrating switchable metal sites.

         <title>Surface Degradation of Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich Cathode and Regulation Mechanism by Atomic Layer Deposition in Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights into the surface mechanism on the single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (SC&#8208;NCM) cathode are disclosed by in situ atomic force microscopy in solid&#8208;state batteries. Via atomic layer deposition, the Li3PO4 is introduced to coat SC&#8208;NCM, leading to the uniform formation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase and suppression of undesired side reaction, which endows batteries with enhanced interfacial stability, durability and dynamics.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathode (SC&#8208;NCM) has attracted increasing interest owing to its greater capacity retention in advanced solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs), while suffers from severe interfacial instability during cycling. Here, via atomic layer deposition, Li3PO4 is introduced to coat SC&#8208;NCM (L&#8208;NCM), to suppress undesired side reaction and enhance interfacial stability. The dynamic degradation and surface regulation of SC&#8208;NCM are investigated inside a working SSLB by in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). We directly observe the uneven cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and surface defects on pristine SC&#8208;NCM particle. Remarkably, the formed amorphous LiF&#8208;rich CEI on L&#8208;NCM maintains its initial structure upon cycling, and thus endows the battery with improved cycling stability and excellent rate capability. Such on&#8208;site tracking provides deep insights into surface mechanism and structure&#8211;reactivity correlation of SC&#8208;NCM, and thus benefits the optimizations of SSLBs.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Atomic Pairs with a Distal Fe3+&#8208;Site Boost Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co&#8722;Fe hetero&#8208;atomic pair, bound to a tungsten phosphide (WP) substrate so that the Lewis acidic Fe center is distal to the surface, boosted water oxidation. A significant contribution from the WP substrate modulated the order of hydroxide transfer. The system offers insights into bimetallic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic systems and provides a model of in situ/operando investigations on the mechanistic understanding as well as future catalysts design.







Abstract
The hetero&#8208;atomic interaction has been the subject of many investigations, due to their heterogeneity, the individual roles of the atoms are still difficult to realize. Herein, an electrocatalyst with a hetero&#8208;atomic pair confined on a tungsten phosphide (WP) substrate so that the Fe3+&#8208;site of the pair is distal to the surface is shown to deliver an extremely low overpotential of 192&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and one of the highest oxygen production turnover frequencies (TOF) of 2.1&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;mV under alkaline environment for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Operando characterization shows the Lewis acidic Fe3+ site boosts a large population of Co4+/3+ and the deprotonation of coordinated water, allowing simultaneously enhanced electron&#8208;transfer as well as the proton&#8208;transfer. A significant contribution from the WP substrate modulates the order of hydroxide transfer in the pre&#8208;equilibrium step (PES) and rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step (RDS), leading to a remarkable OER performance.

         <title>Dual Activation of Molecular Oxygen and Surface Lattice Oxygen in Single Atom Cu1/TiO2 Catalyst for CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolated Cu1+ on Cu1/TiO2 single atom catalysts (SACs) facilitated the simultaneous activation of chemisorbed O2 and 2&#8208;coordinated surface lattice O2&#8722;, which triggered the CO oxidation through E&#8208;R (80&#8201;&#176;C) and MvK (200&#8201;&#176;C) routes synergistically with elevated temperature. This finding provides insights and strategy for the rational design of efficient oxidation catalysts with sufficient reactive oxygen species for practical application.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth mechanism on the simultaneous activation of O2 and surface lattice O2&#8722; on one active metallic site has not been elucidated yet. Herein, we report a strategy for the construction of abundant oxygen activation sites by rational design of Cu1/TiO2 single atom catalysts (SACs). The charge transfer between isolated Cu and TiO2 support generates abundant CuI and 2&#8208;coordinated Olat sites in Cu1&#8722;O&#8722;Ti hybridization structure, which facilitates the chemisorption and activation of O2 molecules. Simultaneously, the Cu1&#8722;O&#8722;Ti induced TiO2 lattice distortion activate the adjacent surface lattice O2&#8722;, achieving the dual activation of O2 and surface lattice O2&#8722;. The Cu1&#8722;O&#8722;Ti active site switches the CO oxidation mechanism from Eley&#8208;Rideal (80&#8201;&#176;C) to Mars&#8211;van Krevelen route (200&#8201;&#176;C) with the increase of reaction temperature. The dual activation of O2 and surface lattice O2&#8722; can by modulating the electron properties of SACs can boost the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation activity.

         <title>FRET Monitoring of a Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Elongation Module Reveals Carrier Protein Shuttling between Catalytic Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Translocation of the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) between two catalytic domains in nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) has been studied for the first time. Monitoring PCP interaction with A and C domains during catalysis using two FRET sensors of an elongation module revealed conformational population shifts that correlate with the directionality of synthesis. The first light&#8208;controlled NRPS was created to further probe and support this model.







Abstract
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) employ multiple domains, specifically arranged in modules, for the assembly&#8208;line biosynthesis of a plethora of bioactive peptides. It is poorly understood how catalysis is correlated with the domain interplay and associated conformational changes. We developed FRET sensors of an elongation module to study in solution the intramodular interactions of the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) with adenylation (A) and condensation (C) domains. Backed by HDX&#8208;MS analysis, we discovered dynamic mixtures of conformations that undergo distinct population changes in favor of the PCP&#8208;A and PCP&#8208;C interactions upon completion of the adenylation and thiolation reactions, respectively. To probe this model we blocked PCP binding to the C domain by photocaging and triggered peptide bond formation with light. Changing intramodular domain affinities of the PCP appear to result in conformational shifts according to the logic of the templated assembly process.

         <title>From a Metal&#8211;Organic Square to a Robust and Regenerable Supramolecular Self&#8208;assembly for Methane Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
From a metal&#8211;organic square, a robust and renewable polyhedron&#8208;based framework material is assembled with potential for CH4 purification from natural gas and CO2 capture from industrial off&#8208;gas.







Abstract
Porous supramolecular assemblies constructed by noncovalent interactions are promising for adsorptive purification of methane because of their easy regeneration. However, the poor stability arising from the weak noncovalent interactions has obstructed their practical applications. Here, we report a robust and easily regenerated polyhedron&#8208;based cationic framework assembled from a metal&#8211;organic square. This material exhibits a very low affinity for CH4 and N2, but captures other competing gases (e.g. C2H6, C3H8, and CO2) with a moderate affinity. These results underpin highly selective separation of a range of gas mixtures that are relevant to natural gas and industrial off&#8208;gas. Dynamic breakthrough studies demonstrate its practical separation for C2H6/CH4, C3H8/CH4, CO2/N2, and CO2/CH4. Particularly, the separation time is &#8776;11&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the C2H6/CH4 (15/85 v/v) mixture and &#8776;49&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the C3H8/CH4 (15/85 v/v) mixture (under a flow of 2.0&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1), respectively, enabling its capability for CH4 purification from light alkanes.

         <title>Remote Editing of Stacked Aromatic Assemblies for Heteroannular C&#8722;H Functionalization by a Palladium Switch between Aromatic Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient ligand&#8208;enabled palladium&#8208;catalyzed heteroannular C&#8722;H olefination and allylation of stacked aromatic assemblies has been developed, in which the remote heteroannular site over the proximal homoannular site is functionalized. Mechanistic investigations support an olefin coordination&#8208;promoted interannular palladium migration process determinative for reversal of the site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
An approach allowing remote editing of stacked aromatic assemblies for heteroannular C&#8722;H functionalization would represent a transformative chemical toolbox that may make the diversification of complex molecules in a straightforward manner. However, such a C&#8722;H activation is usually less kinetically and thermodynamically favorable than homoannular ortho C&#8722;H activation and remains a fundamental challenge. Herein we disclose an engineer's approach, using a transient ligand as an interim bridge between two aryl rings (analogues to mountaintops) to anchor the metal center on the remote heteroannular C&#8722;H bond. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we present the palladium&#8208;catalyzed heteroannular C&#8722;H olefination of stacked aromatic assemblies with olefins and allylation with vinyl acetates using L&#8208;tert&#8208;leucine acid as a transient ligand. Mechanistic investigations suggest an unusual olefin coordination&#8208;promoted interannular palladium migration process determinative for reversal of the site&#8208;selectivity.

The dynamic conformational changes in the secondary structures of proteins are essential to their functions and can regulate diverse cellular events. Herein we report the design of a synthetic polymer&#8208;based secondary structure analogue of a zinc finger (ZnF) by introducing a zinc coordination motif to overcome the free energy barrier predicted by theoretical calculations and fold&#8208;free polymer chains. The conformational switching between unfolded and folded state of the ZnF analogue can be triggered in situ to drastically manipulate the accessibility of conjugated cell adhesive ligands to the cell membrane receptors, thereby effectively controlling the adhesion, spreading, mechanosensing, and differentiation of stem cells. We believe that emulating the dynamic secondary structures of proteins via rational design of a folded synthetic polymer&#8211;cation complex is a promising strategy for developing bioactive materials to mediate desired cellular functions.

         <title>Squarephaneic Tetraanhydride: A Conjugated Square&#8208;Shaped Cyclophane for the Synthesis of Porous Organic Materials
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique new member of the family of aromatic carboxylic anhydride building blocks&#8212;a conjugated square&#8208;shaped cyclophane with four anhydride groups&#8212;is presented. The building block can be obtained in a three&#8208;step synthesis and functionalised efficiently to give materials with highly interesting properties ranging from high degrees of porosity to excellent electrochemical properties, as shown by the conversion into imides and carboxylates.







Abstract
Aromatic carboxylic anhydrides are ubiquitous building blocks in organic materials chemistry and have received considerable attention in the synthesis of organic semiconductors, pigments, and battery electrode materials. Here we extend the family of aromatic carboxylic anhydrides with a unique new member, a conjugated cyclophane with four anhydride groups. The cyclophane is obtained in a three&#8208;step synthesis and can be functionalised efficiently, as shown by the conversion into tetraimides and an octacarboxylate. Crystal structures reveal the high degree of porosity achievable with the new building block. Excellent electrochemical properties and reversible reduction to the tetraanions are shown for the imides; NMR and EPR measurements confirm the global aromaticity of the dianions and evidence the global Baird aromaticity of the tetraanions. Considering the short synthesis and unique properties, we expect widespread use of the new building block in the development of organic materials.

         <title>Taming Heavier Group 14 Imine Analogues: Accessing Tin Nitrogen [Sn=N] Double Bonds and their Cycloaddition/Metathesis Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study on taming stannaimines (R2Sn=NR) is reported by identifying a suitable supporting ligand framework for stannylenes in combination with organic azides. The nitrogen substituent of these compounds was crucial for allowing a broad range of subsequent reactivity ranging from cycloadditions to multiple bond metathesis reactions, thus highlighting the necessary balance of rendering challenging systems isolable but still reactive.







Abstract
A systematic study to access stable stannaimines is reported, by combining different heteroleptic stannylenes with a range of organic azides. The reactions of terphenyl&#8208;/hypersilyl&#8208;substituted stannylenes yield the putative tin nitrogen double bond, but is directly followed by 1,2&#8208;silyl migration to give SnII systems featuring bulky silylamido ligands. By contrast, the transition from a two &#963; donor ligand set to a mixed &#963;&#8208;donor/&#960;&#8208;donor scaffold allows access to three new stannaimines which can be handled at room temperature. The reactivity profile of these Sn=N bonded species is crucially dependent on the substituent at the nitrogen atom. As such, the Sn=NMes (Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) system is capable of activating a broad range of substrates under ambient conditions via 1,2&#8208;addition reactions, [2+2] and [4+2] cycloaddition reactions. Most interestingly, very rare examples of main group multiple bond metathesis reactions are also found to be viable.

         <title>Condensed Osmaquinolines with NIR&#8208;II Absorption Synthesized by Aryl C&#8722;H Annulation and Aromatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of condensed metallaquinolines capable of NIR&#8208;II absorption involves an unconventional C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling through the combined effects of Ag and Os. This work demonstrates an unusual reactivity pattern of anthranil and contributes a new approach to N&#8208;doped condensed metallacycles. It also illustrates a new cyclic d&#960;&#8208;p&#960; conjugation strategy for the design of NIR&#8208;II absorbing molecules.







Abstract
The structural design and tuning of properties of metallaaromatics are crucial in materials and energy science. Herein, we describe the rapid synthesis of tetracyclic metallaaromatics containing quinoline and pentalene motifs fused by a metal&#8208;bridged fragment. These unique compounds display remarkably broad absorption, enabling for the first time the absorption of metallaaromatics to reach the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) bio&#8208;window. The formation of osmaquinoline unit involves an unconventional C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling promoted by AgBF4 to achieve [3+3] cycloaddition. The introduction of cyclic d&#960;&#8208;p&#960; conjugation and extension of the aromatic &#960;&#8208;framework can effectively shrink the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, thus broadening the absorption window. The considerable photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) in both the NIR&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II windows, the high photothermal stability and the excellent electrochemical behavior suggest many potential applications of these condensed metallaquinolines.

         <title>A Sonication&#8208;Activated Valence&#8208;Variable Sono&#8208;Sensitizer/Catalyst for Autography Inhibition/Ferroptosis&#8208;Induced Tumor Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the tumor microenvironment, we developed a versatile sono&#8208;sensitizer/catalyst that can realize ultrasound&#8208;responsive spatiotemporal chemodynamic therapy coupled with sonodynamic therapy. The presented nanoplatform thereby provides a feasible and efficient tumor theranostic modality with remarkable outcome and biosafety.







Abstract
The effective deployment of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated oncotherapy in practice remains challenging, mired by uncontrollable catalytic processes, stern reaction conditions and safety concerns. Herein, we develop a copper nanodot integrating sonodynamic and catalytic effects within one active center, which responds to exogenous ultrasound (US) and endogenous H2O2 stimuli. US irradiation induces the valence conversion from CuII to CuI catalyzing H2O2 into &#8901;OH for chemodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, valence transformation results in electron&#8208;hole pairs separation, promoting ROS generation for sonodynamic therapy. Notably, copper nanodots not only block lysosome fusion and degradation leading to autophagy flux blockage, but also interfere with the glutathione peroxidase 4 and cystine&#8208;glutamate antiporter SLC7A11 function achieving ferroptosis. Furthermore, reversible valence changes, inherent hydrophilicity and renal clearance ultrasmall size guarantee biosafety.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release Pentafluorosulfanylation and Tetrafluoro(aryl)sulfanylation of [1.1.1]Propellane: Reactivity and Structural Insight
</title>

Merging SF5 and Ar&#8722;SF4 chemistry with strain&#8208;release functionalization of [1.1.1]propellane enables us to explore uncharted chemical space associated with C(sp3)&#8722;SF5 and C(sp3)&#8722;SF4Ar motifs. X&#8208;ray analyses of the resultant &#8220;hybrid isosteres&#8221; reveal remarkably short transannular nonbonding C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C contacts&#8212;among the shortest distances reported to date. DFT and SC&#8208;XRD data provide evidence that the wing C&#8722;C bonds play a key role in stabilization.







Abstract
We leveraged the recent increase in synthetic accessibility of SF5Cl and Ar&#8722;SF4Cl compounds to combine chemistry of the SF5 and SF4Ar groups with strain&#8208;release functionalization. By effectively adding SF5 and SF4Ar radicals across [1.1.1]propellane, we accessed structurally unique bicyclopentanes, bearing two distinct elements of bioisosterism. Upon evaluating these &#8220;hybrid isostere&#8221; motifs in the solid state, we measured exceptionally short transannular distances; in one case, the distance rivals the shortest nonbonding C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C contact reported to date. This prompted SC&#8208;XRD and DFT analyses that support the notion that a donor&#8208;acceptor interaction involving the &#8220;wing&#8221; C&#8722;C bonds is playing an important role in stabilization. Thus, these heretofore unknown structures expand the palette for highly coveted three&#8208;dimensional fluorinated building blocks and provide insight to a more general effect observed in bicyclopentanes.

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of a Library of Heparan Sulfate&#8208;Like &#8220;Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail&#8221; Linked Multimers for Structure and Activity Relationship Studies

New heparan sulfate (HS) mimetics were synthesized where the disaccharide modules were connected from the reducing end to the non&#8208;reducing end to mimic the structures of native polysaccharides more closely. A library of 27 such &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharides was prepared, which was found to exhibit similar structure&#8208;activity relationship trends as HS hexasaccharides in the binding to fibroblast growth factor 2.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) plays important roles in many biological processes. The inherent complexity of naturally existing HS has severely hindered the thorough understanding of their structure&#8208;activity relationship. To facilitate biological studies, a new strategy has been developed to synthesize a HS&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharide library, where HS disaccharides were linked in a &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; fashion from the reducing end of a disaccharide module to the non&#8208;reducing end of a neighboring module. Combinatorial syntheses of 27 HS&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharides were achieved. This new class of compounds bound with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF&#8208;2) with similar structure&#8208;activity trends as HS oligosaccharides bearing native glycosyl linkages. The ease of synthesis and the ability to mirror natural HS activity trends suggest that the new head&#8208;to&#8208;tail linked pseudo&#8208;oligosaccharides could be an exciting tool to facilitate the understanding of HS biology.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for High&#8208;Performance Lithium/Sodium&#8208;Iodine Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complex of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) linked with Ti3C2Tx MXene was designed and adopted as electrodes with excellent cyclic stability and rate&#8208;performances in Li&#8208;I2 and Na&#8208;I2 batteries.







Abstract
The rechargeable lithium/sodium&#8208;iodine battery (Li/Na&#8208;I2) is a promising candidate for meeting the growing energy demand. Herein, a flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) linked to the Ti3C2Tx MXene complex (HOF@Ti3C2Tx) has been presented for iodine loading. HOF is self&#8208;assembled by organic monomers through hydrogen bonding interactions between each monomer. It leads to numerous cavities in HOF structure, which can encapsulate iodine through various adsorptive sites and intermolecular interactions. The unique structure of complex can accelerate the nucleation of iodine, achieve fast reaction kinetics, stabilize iodide and retard the shuttle effect, thus improving the cycling stability of I2&#8208;based batteries. The I2/HOF@Ti3C2Tx exhibits large reversible capacities of 260.2 and 207.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C after repeated cycling for Li&#8208;I2 and Na&#8208;I2 batteries, respectively. This work can gain insights into the HOF&#8208;related energy storage application with reversible iodine encapsulation and its related redox reaction mechanisms with Li and Na metal ions.

         <title>Operando Laboratory&#8208;Based Multi&#8208;Edge X&#8208;Ray Absorption Near&#8208;Edge Spectroscopy of Solid Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando laboratory&#8208;based multi&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy (XANES) offers possibilities for advanced catalyst characterization, as demonstrated for mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic CO2 hydrogenation catalysts consisting of Ni, Cu, and Fe. Synergistic effects during catalyst reduction and their influence on catalytic performance were unraveled, guiding rational design of multielement solid catalysts for various applications.







Abstract
Laboratory&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and especially X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) offers new opportunities in catalyst characterization and presents not only an alternative, but also a complementary approach to precious beamtime at synchrotron facilities. We successfully designed a laboratory&#8208;based setup for performing operando, quasi&#8208;simultaneous XANES analysis at multiple K&#8208;edges, more specifically, operando XANES of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic CO2 hydrogenation catalysts containing Ni, Fe, and Cu. Detailed operando XANES studies of the multielement solid catalysts revealed metal&#8208;dependent differences in the reducibility and re&#8208;oxidation behavior and their influence on the catalytic performance in CO2 hydrogenation. The applicability of operando laboratory&#8208;based XANES at multiple K&#8208;edges paves the way for advanced multielement catalyst characterization complementing detailed studies at synchrotron facilities.

A conjugated Cy5 dye&#8208;peptide system reveals the formation of two novel and structurally distinct supramolecular assemblies with photo&#8208;physical characteristics of H&#8208;type dimers or tetramers, respectively. The molecular ultrastructures are triggered by the complementary interplay of mutual chromophore coupling and pH induced changes in the peptide charge pattern.







Abstract
Synthetic multichromophore systems are of great importance in artificial light harvesting devices, organic optoelectronics, tumor imaging and therapy. Here, we introduce a promising strategy for the construction of self&#8208;assembled peptide templated dye stacks based on coupling of a de novo designed pH sensitive peptide with a cyanine dye Cy5 at its N&#8208;terminus. Microscopic techniques, in particular cryogenic TEM (cryo&#8208;TEM) and cryo&#8208;electron tomography technique (cryo&#8208;ET), reveal two types of highly ordered three&#8208;dimensional assembly structures on the micrometer scale. Unbranched compact layered rods are observed at pH&#8197;7.4 and two&#8208;dimensional membrane&#8208;like assemblies at pH&#8197;3.4, both species displaying spectral features of H&#8208;aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the coupling of Cy5 moieties promotes the formation of both ultrastructures, whereas the protonation states of acidic and basic amino acid side chains dictates their ultimate three&#8208;dimensional organization.

         <title>Maximized Green Photoluminescence in Tb&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework via Pressure&#8208;Treated Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>

The pressure&#8208;treated Tb(BTC)(H2O)6 exhibits unprecedentedly enhanced PLQY of 90.4&#8201;% comparing to the initial state (50.6&#8201;%). This pressure&#8208;treated process can optimize the ligand singlet and triplet states close to the Tb3+ energy level, which boosts ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer in Tb(BTC)(H2O)6.







Abstract
Lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks are of great interest in the development of photoluminescence (PL) materials owing to their structural tunability and intrinsic features of lanthanide elements. However, there exists some limitations arising from poor matching with metal ions, thereby exhibiting a weak ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer (LMET) process. Here we demonstrate a pressure&#8208;treated strategy for achieving high PL performance in green&#8208;emitting Tb(BTC)(H2O)6. The PL quantum yield of pressure&#8208;treated sample increased from 50.6&#8201;% to 90.4&#8201;%. We found that the enhanced hydrogen bonds locked the conjugated configuration formed by two planes of carboxyl group and benzene ring, enabling the promoted intersystem crossing to effectively drive LMET. Moreover, the optimized singlet and triplet states also validated the facilitated LMET process. This work opens the opportunity of structure optimization to improve PL performance in MOFs by pressure&#8208;treated engineering.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelled Magnetic Dendrite&#8208;Shaped Microrobots for Photodynamic Prostate Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrite&#8208;shaped hematite microrobots have been developed as an effective GSH depletion agent for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of prostate cancer cells. These single&#8208;component microrobots with dual light/magnetic field actuation can induce GSH depletion, greatly enhancing in vitro PDT performance and accomplishing the non&#8208;contact transportation of micro&#8208;sized objects.







Abstract
Photocatalytic micromotors that exhibit wireless and controllable motion by light have been extensively explored for cancer treatment by photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in the tumor microenvironment can down&#8208;regulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level for cancer therapy. Herein, we present dendrite&#8208;shaped light&#8208;powered hematite microrobots as an effective GSH depletion agent for PDT of prostate cancer cells. These hematite microrobots can display negative phototactic motion under light irradiation and flexible actuation in a defined path controlled by an external magnetic field. Non&#8208;contact transportation of micro&#8208;sized cells can be achieved by manipulating the microrobot's motion. In addition, the biocompatible microrobots induce GSH depletion and greatly enhance PDT performance. The proposed dendrite&#8208;shaped hematite microrobots contribute to developing dual light/magnetic field&#8208;powered micromachines for the biomedical field.

         <title>The Role of Heme Peroxo Oxidants in the Rational Mechanistic Modeling of Nitric Oxide Synthase: Characterization of Key Intermediates and Elucidation of the Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mid&#8208;valent heme peroxo mimics have been evaluated in the modeling of a pathogenically significant enzyme, nitric oxide synthase. The key mechanistic details closely resemble one of the most widely reproduced enzymatic proposals. In&#8208;detail characterization of reaction intermediates is presented, and the overall mechanism is elucidated.







Abstract
Mammalian nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mediates the two&#8208;step O2&#8208;dependent oxidative degradation of arginine, and has been linked to a medley of disease situations in humans. Nonetheless, its exact mechanism of action still remains unclear. This work presents the first NOS model system where biologically proposed heme superoxo and peroxo intermediates are assessed as active oxidants against oxime substrates. Markedly, heme peroxo intermediates engaged in a bioinspired oxime oxidation reaction pathway, converting oximes to ketones and nitroxyl anions (NO&#8722;). Detailed thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanistic interrogations all evince a rate&#8208;limiting step primarily driven by the nucleophilicity of the heme peroxo moiety. Coherent with other findings, 18O and 15N isotope substitution experiments herein suffice compelling evidence toward a detailed mechanism, which draw close parallels to one of the enzymatic proposals. Intriguingly, recent enzymatic studies also lend credence to these findings, and several relevant reaction intermediates have been observed during NOS turnover.

         <title>Electrochemical Double&#8208;Layer Capacitor based on Carbon@ Covalent Organic Framework Aerogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework (COFs) aerogels are shaped into flexible electrode composite by a simple compression method. It shows permanent porosity and great ion diffusion pathways appropriated for electrochemical double&#8208;layer capacitors (EDLC). These EDLC devices demonstrated a significant areal capacitance (11.2&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with the lowest &#964;0 reported in COF&#8208;based capacitors, 50&#8197;ms, and a 98&#8201;% capacitance retention over 10&#8201;000 charge/discharge cycles.







Abstract
High energy demand results in comprehensive research of novel materials for energy sources and storage applications. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess appropriate features such as long&#8208;range order, permanent porosity, tunable pore size, and ion diffusion pathways to be competitive electrode materials. Herein, we present a deep electrochemical study of two COF&#8208;aerogels shaped into flexible COF&#8208;electrodes (ECOFs) by a simple compression method to fabricate an electrochemical double&#8208;layer capacitor (EDLC). This energy storage system has considerable interest owing to its high&#8208;power density and long cycle life compared with batteries. Our result confirmed the outstanding behavior of ECOFs as EDLC devices with a capacity retention of almost 100&#8201;% after 10&#8201;000 charge/discharge cycles and, to our knowledge, the highest areal capacitance (9.55&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in aqueous electrolytes at higher scan rates (1000&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1) for COFs. More importantly, the hierarchical porosity observed in the ECOFs increases ion transport, which permits a fast interface polarization (low &#964;0 values). The complete sheds light on using ECOFs as novel electrode material to fabricate EDLC devices.

         <title>Modular Construction of Unnatural &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amino Acid Derivatives by Multicomponent Radical Cross&#8208;Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is a highly selective radical cascade&#8208;cross&#8208;coupling reaction for the modular synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acids (ATAA) under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal the excited state of an in situ&#8208;generated oxazolone enolate as a key intermediate, which functions both as a radical precursor and an efficient reductant.







Abstract
Although the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acids (ATAAs) has been extensively studied, the development of an inexpensive and facile methodology to incorporate multifunctionality on ATAAs remains challenging. In this article, we present a single&#8208;step radical approach for the modular synthesis of functionally diverse ATAAs. This synthesis takes place under mild conditions with an absence of metals, photocatalysts, and all other additives. We demonstrate the broad applications of this approach on a variety of aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, alkenes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and oxazolones. The results prove that our method provides excellent functional group tolerance and late&#8208;stage applicability, as well as gram&#8208;scale synthesis via flow chemistry. Additionally, we include mechanistic studies which reveal that the excited state of oxazolone enolate upon light excitation is a key intermediate that acts as a radical precursor and an efficient reductant.

         <title>CO2 Hydrogenation over Copper/ZnO Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Water&#8208;Promoted Transient Synthesis of Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acting as a bridge for hydrogen atoms during CO2 hydrogenation, water facilitates the transformation of relatively stable intermediates for enhancing the activity which in turn produces more water to react with CO via the water&#8208;gas shift reaction. As a result, the yield of methanol is promoted by a suitable amount of water over Cu single atoms on ZnO supports.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of CO2 by renewable power&#8208;generated hydrogen offers a promising approach to a sustainable carbon cycle. However, the role of water during CO2 hydrogenation is still under debate. Herein, we demonstrated that either too low or too high contents of water hampered the methanol synthesis over Cu/ZnO based catalysts. For Cu single atoms on ZnO supports, the optimal content of water was 0.11&#8197;vol.&#8201;% under 30&#8197;bar (CO2&#8201;:&#8201;H2=1&#8201;:&#8201;3) at 170&#8201;&#176;C. Upon the introduction of optimal&#8208;content water, the methanol selectivity immediately became 99.1&#8201;%, meanwhile the conversion of CO2 underwent a volcano&#8208;type trend with the maximum of 4.9&#8201;%. According to mechanistic studies, water acted as a bridge between H atoms and CO2/intermediates, facilitating the transformation of COOH* and CH2O*. The enhanced activity induced the generation of more water to react with CO via water&#8208;gas shift reaction, resulting in the increase in methanol selectivity.

         <title>Asymmetrically Substituted 10H,10&#8242;H&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;Spirobi[acridine] Derivatives as Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

The 10H,10&#8242;H&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[acridine] core including moieties featuring two non&#8208;equivalent N&#8208;substituted&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine subunits with different structural and electronic characteristics were designed as HTMs of PSCs. The planar 3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole units based HTM (BSA50) not only exhibits better electronic properties, but also results in better passivating capability for the perovskite trap states via stronger donor ability.







Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) based on the 10H, 10&#8242;H&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobi [acridine] core (BSA50 and BSA51) were synthesized, and their electronic properties were explored. Experimental and theoretical studies show that the presence of rigid 3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole moieties in BSA 50 brings about improved hole mobility and higher work function compared to bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amine units in BSA51, which increase interfacial hole transportation from perovskite to HTM. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on BSA50 boost power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 22.65&#8201;%, and a PSC module using BSA50 HTM exhibits a PCE of 21.35&#8201;% (6.5&#215;7&#8197;cm) with a Voc of 8.761&#8197;V and FF of 79.1&#8201;%. The unencapsulated PSCs exhibit superior stability to devices employing spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, retaining nearly 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;h operation output. This work demonstrates the high potential of molecularly engineered spirobi[acridine] derivatives as HTMs as replacements for spiro&#8208;OMeTAD.

         <title>Untangling Degradation Chemistries of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Through Interpretable Hybrid Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interpretable hybrid machine learning framework is designed for post&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion battery (e.g. lithium&#8208;sulfur battery) forecast using lab&#8208;scale battery dataset with compromised quality and tremendous variables. Key knowledge about the complex and dynamic degradation chemistries is extracted to illuminate future battery design and optimization.







Abstract
The development of emerging rechargeable batteries is often hindered by limited chemical understanding composing of entangled patterns in an enormous space. Herein, we propose an interpretable hybrid machine learning framework to untangle intractable degradation chemistries of conversion&#8208;type batteries. Rather than being a black box, this framework not only demonstrates an ability to accurately forecast lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (with a test mean absolute error of 8.9&#8201;% for the end&#8208;of&#8208;life prediction) but also generate useful physical understandings that illuminate future battery design and optimization. The framework also enables the discovery of a previously unknown performance indicator, the ratio of electrolyte amount to high&#8208;voltage&#8208;region capacity at the first discharge, for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries complying practical merits. The present data&#8208;driven approach is readily applicable to other energy storage systems due to its versatility and flexibility in modules and inputs.

         <dc:description>
A novel organic photoredox catalyst was discovered by simply adding a catalytic amount of TfOH as a co&#8208;catalyst to readily available thioxanthone. The new catalyst, 9&#8208;HTXTF, shows a sufficiently long singlet lifetime and adequately strong oxidation potential, as well as relatively facile photoexcitation, with applications in the hydrogenation and deuteration of carbonylated alkenes.







Abstract
Hydrogenation of alkenes is one of the most fundamental transformations in organic synthesis, and widely used in the petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries. Although numerous hydrogenation methods have been developed, novel types of catalysis with new mechanisms and new hydrogen sources are still desirable. Thioxanthone (TX) is widely used in energy&#8208;transfer photoreactions, but rarely in photoredox processes. Herein we show that a catalytic amount of TfOH as a co&#8208;catalyst can tune the properties of TX to make it a photoredox catalyst with highly enhanced oxidative capability in the hydrogenation of carbonylated alkenes with the cheap petroleum industrial product p&#8208;xylene serving as the hydrogen source. Deuterium can also be introduced by this method by using D2O as the D source. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of using p&#8208;xylene as a hydrogen source.

         <title>Electronic Materials: An Antiaromatic Propeller Made from the Four&#8208;Fold Fusion of Tetraoxa[8]circulene and Perylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Annelating the antiaromatic tetraoxa[8]circulene with four perylenediimide units yields an intensely absorbing and emissive charge&#8208;transfer molecule. The aromatic/antiaromatic character of neutral and charged species and the incorporation in bulk hetero junction solar cell (power conversion efficiency of 6.4&#8201;%) is described.







Abstract
The synthesis of an antiaromatic tetraoxa[8]circulene annulated with four perylene diimides (PDI), giving a dynamic non&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, is described. The molecule contains 32 aromatic rings surrounding one formally antiaromatic planarized cyclooctatetraene (COT). The intense absorption (&#1013;=3.35&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in CH2Cl2) and emission bands are assigned to internal charge&#8208;transfer transitions in the combined PDI&#8208;circulene &#960;&#8208;system. The spectroscopic data is supported by density functional theory calculations, and nuclear independent chemical shift calculation indicate that the antiaromatic COT has increased aromaticity in the reduced state. Electrochemical studies show that the compound can reversibly reach the tetra&#8208; and octa&#8208;anionic states by reduction of the four PDI units, and the deca&#8208;anionic state by reduction of the central COT ring. The material functions effectively in bulk hetero junction solar cells as a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, reaching a power conversion efficiency of 6.4&#8201;%.

A pressure&#8208;treatment strategy for achieving high photoluminescence performance in a green&#8208;emitting Tb&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework is reported by Xinyi Yang, Qianrong Fang, Banglin Chen, Bo Zou et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202210836). The enhanced hydrogen bonds lock the conjugated configuration, promoting intersystem crossing to effectively drive ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer. The photoluminescence quantum yield increased from 50.6&#8201;% to 90.4&#8201;% for the pressure&#8208;treated MOF.

The arginine degradation pathway of pathogenically crucial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) heme enzyme has been efficiently modeled utilizing synthetic analogs of corresponding reaction components. This model reaction between oxime substrates and heme peroxo intermediates essentially reflects the second mechanistic step of NOS. As reported by Gayan&#8197;B. Wijeratne and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202211521), in&#8208;depth thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanistic interrogations unveil key attributes that closely parallel the enzymatic system, shedding light on some impactful unknowns.

Like a bow , PoFUT2 arms a peptide (arrow) and launches it once glycosylated with the help of a water environment. In their Research Article (e202213610), Ram&#243;n Hurtado&#8208;Guerrero, Pedro Merino, and co&#8208;workers show using QM/MM methods how the enzyme takes advantage of a high exposure of the active site, allowing water molecules to facilitate a pure SN2 mechanism. The synergistic effect of an arginine residue and water molecules facilitates a smooth leaving of the pyrophosphate group.

An antiaromatic molecular propeller acts as a strong electron acceptor, fluorophore, and dye in bulk heterojunction solar cells. In their Research Article (e202212293), Glib&#8197;V. Baryshnikov, Colin Nuckolls, Michael Pittelkow, and co&#8208;workers report how annulation of four perylene diimides to a tetraoxa[8]circulene gives a dynamic non&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule with 32 aromatic rings surrounding a central planarized cycloctatetraene. The molecule accepts up to ten electrons, which induces a significant gain of aromaticity.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Free C&#8722;H Activation: Strategic Approaches towards Realizing the Full Potential of C&#8722;H Activation in Sustainable Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of silver additives has enabled many highly valuable synthetic methods in the field of C&#8722;H activation. However, such additives are disadvantageous with respect to sustainability, scalability, and economic considerations. This Review provides a systematic overview of strategic approaches towards developing silver&#8208;free protocols based on the mechanistic role of silver.







Abstract
The activation of carbon&#8722;hydrogen bonds is considered as one of the most attractive techniques in synthetic organic chemistry because it bears the potential to shorten synthetic routes as well as to produce complementary product scopes compared to traditional synthetic strategies. However, many current methods employ silver salts as additives, leading to stoichiometric metal waste and thereby preventing the full potential of C&#8722;H activation to be exploited. Therefore, the development of silver&#8208;free protocols has recently received increasing attention. Mechanistically, silver can serve various roles in C&#8722;H activation and thus, avoiding the use of silver requires different approaches based on the role it serves in a given process. In this Review, we present the comparison of silver&#8208;based and silver&#8208;free methods. Focusing on the strategic approaches to develop silver&#8208;free C&#8722;H activation, we provide the reader with the means to develop sustainable methods for C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>A Highly Dynamic Covalent Polymer Network without Creep: Mission Impossible?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the largest challenges in the design of dynamic covalent networks is to balance reactivity during reprocessing with stability during use. In this Minireview several strategies are highlighted that combine high processability and creep resistance such as latent catalysis, availability of reactive groups, substituents and intrinsic stability of the dynamic bond.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymer networks provide an interesting solution to the challenging recyclability of thermosets and elastomers. One of the remaining design constraints, however, is balancing thermal reprocessability in the form of material flow with dimensional stability during use. As a result, many chemistries are being investigated in order to improve bond reactivity control and material robustness. This Minireview highlights a number of promising concepts, with a particular emphasis on disconnecting chemical reactivity in low and high temperature regimes to obtain creep resistant, yet highly dynamic polymer networks. In addition, we will highlight the impact of sharp reactivity changes when applying extrapolation&#8208;based approaches during rheological analysis. As a result, we are confident that abandoning the myth of &#8220;permanent&#8221; reactivity will aid in the development of sustainable polymeric materials that can truly combine the benefits of thermoplastic and thermoset behaviour.

         <title>Strain Control to Stabilize Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;uniformly distributed tensile strain is likely to present in solution&#8208;processed perovskite thin films, which severely undermines the operational stability of resultant perovskite solar cells. A fundamental understanding and cautious control of residual strain within the perovskites is indispensable to derive stable perovskite materials with designed properties.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are rivaling most commercial photovoltaics in the aspect of efficiency and cost, while their intrinsic instability remains a major concern for their practical deployment. The presence of undesirable strain in PSCs during device fabrication and operation refers to the extension/narrowing of chemical bonds and expansion/shrinkage of lattice volume, which largely affects device stability due to promoted phase transition, chemical decomposition, and mechanical fragility. Pioneering investigations and remarkable achievements have revealed that strain control is indispensable in the design of stable PSCs. Herein, the evolution of strain in perovskite thin films and its effect on device performance is elucidated, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies of strain modulation are systematically reviewed. A thorough understanding and cautious control of the strain&#8208;related phenomenon pave the pathway to derive perovskite materials with desired properties.

         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;element nanoparticles (NPs) consisting of five or more elements often exhibit superior properties, including catalysis, compared with conventional NPs. Therefore, a variety of synthesis methods have recently been studied. In this review, we focus on chemical synthesis of multi&#8208;element NPs based on solution reactions, and discuss synthesis techniques as well as NP characterization and properties.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;element nanoparticles (NPs) consisting of five or more elements have been increasingly studied in the past five years. Their emergence is taking materials science one step further because they exhibit superior properties to those of conventional NPs in a range of respects, including catalysis. This Review focuses on the recent progress in multi&#8208;element NPs regarding synthesis, especially with regard to chemical synthesis, characterization, and properties. We begin with a brief introduction of multi&#8208;element NPs and an overview of their synthesis methods. Then, we present representative examples of multi&#8208;element alloy NPs and ceramic NPs, including oxide NPs prepared by chemical syntheses. This Review intends to provide useful insights into the chemical methods that are used to synthesize multi&#8208;element NPs, and includes a discussion on the possibilities arising from their use in new functional materials.

         <title>Selective Biocatalytic N&#8208;Methylation of Unsaturated Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Methylated and &#8208;alkylated unsaturated heterocycles are privileged scaffolds in pharmaceuticals that are often tedious to synthesize. Now, promiscuous and engineered enzymes can be used to access such molecules through alkylation with high regioselectivity, high yield and on a preparative scale using simple starting materials.







Abstract
Methods for regioselective N&#8208;methylation and &#8208;alkylation of unsaturated heterocycles with &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; reagents are highly sought&#8208;after. This reaction could drastically simplify synthesis of privileged bioactive molecules. Here we report engineered and natural methyltransferases for challenging N&#8208;(m)ethylation of heterocycles, including benzimidazoles, benzotriazoles, imidazoles and indazoles. The reactions are performed through a cyclic enzyme cascade that consists of two methyltransferases using only iodoalkanes or methyl tosylate as simple reagents.

     alt="Selective Biocatalytic N-Methylation of Unsaturated Heterocycles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Methylated and -alkylated unsaturated heterocycles are privileged scaffolds in pharmaceuticals that are often tedious to synthesize. Now, promiscuous and engineered enzymes can be used to access such molecules through alkylation with high regioselectivity, high yield and on a preparative scale using simple starting materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods for regioselective &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylation and -alkylation of unsaturated heterocycles with &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; reagents are highly sought-after. This reaction could drastically simplify synthesis of privileged bioactive molecules. Here we report engineered and natural methyltransferases for challenging &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(m)ethylation of heterocycles, including benzimidazoles, benzotriazoles, imidazoles and indazoles. The reactions are performed through a cyclic enzyme cascade that consists of two methyltransferases using only iodoalkanes or methyl tosylate as simple reagents. This method enables the selective synthesis of important molecules that are otherwise difficult to access, proceeds with high regioselectivity (r.r. up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;%), yield (up to 99&#8201;%), on a preparative scale, and with nearly equimolar concentrations of simple starting materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Addition of N&#8208;unprotected Propargylic Amines to Trifluoromethyl Ketones by Carbonyl Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Despite the very low acidity of the inert &#945; C&#8722;H bonds (pKa&#8776;42.6), direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H addition of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines to trifluoromethyl ketones has been achieved by using a chiral pyridoxal as the carbonyl catalyst, producing a broad variety of chiral alkynyl &#946;&#8208;aminoalcohols in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 84&#8201;% yield, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Direct asymmetric functionalization of the inert &#945; C&#8722;H bonds of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines is a big challenge in organic chemistry, due to the low acidity (pKa&#8776;42.6) of the &#945; C&#8722;H bonds and interruption of the nucleophilic NH2 group. By using a chiral pyridoxal as carbonyl catalyst, we have successfully realized direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H addition of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines to trifluoromethyl ketones, producing a broad range of chiral alkynyl &#946;&#8208;aminoalcohols in 54&#8211;84&#8201;% yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 99&#8201;% ee). The &#945; C&#8722;H bonds of propargylic amines are greatly activated by the pyridoxal catalyst via the formation of an imine intermediate, resulting in the increase of acidity by up to 1022&#8197;times (from pKa&#8197;42.6 to pKa&#8197;20.1), which become acidic enough to be deprotonated under mild conditions for the asymmetric addition. This work presented an impressive example for asymmetric functionalization of inert C&#8722;H bonds enabled by an organocatalyst.

         <title>Cross &#946; Amyloid Nanotubes Demonstrate Promiscuous Catalysis in a Chemical Reaction Network via Co&#8208;option</title>

The promiscuous competencies of cross &#946; nanotubes were shown towards a reaction network with three orthogonal transformations that are connected via co&#8208;option, underpinning the important roles of short amyloids as earliest enzymatic folds.







Abstract
In Darwin's warm pond rich with nutrients, lesser number of early catalytic machineries with modest capabilities were able to demonstrate promiscuity by catalyzing diverse biochemical transformations important for protometabolism. Herein, we report catalytically promiscuous amyloid&#8208;based short peptide assemblies that could concomitantly catalyse three metabolically important yet orthogonal reactions. The surface exposed catalytic dyads featuring lysines and imidazoles were utilized for C=N condensation via dynamic covalent linkages and modulation of protonation events, respectively. Further, the peptide assemblies could promiscuously catalyse hydrolysis as well as retro&#8208;aldol reactions, that could be co&#8208;opted to facilitate C=N bond formation, either by a feedforward&#8208;driven reaction network or by replenishing depleted substrates. The catalytic diversity of short peptide based promiscuous &#946;&#8208;sheet folds suggests their possible role in promoting the protometabolic network in early earth.

         <title>Expansion of the Catalytic Repertoire of Alcohol Dehydrogenases in Plant Metabolism
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Medium chain alcohol dehydrogenases usually perform a reversible 1,2&#8208;reduction of aldehydes to form the corresponding alcohols. Here we show how the active site of these dehydrogenases can be modified to perform 1,2&#8208;reduction of iminium moieties, as well 1,4&#8208;reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminium groups and 1,4&#8208;reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes.







Abstract
Medium&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) comprise a highly conserved enzyme family that catalyse the reversible reduction of aldehydes. However, recent discoveries in plant natural product biosynthesis suggest that the catalytic repertoire of ADHs has been expanded. Here we report the crystal structure of dihydroprecondylocarpine acetate synthase (DPAS), an ADH that catalyses the non&#8208;canonical 1,4&#8208;reduction of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminium moiety. Comparison with structures of plant&#8208;derived ADHs suggest the 1,4&#8208;iminium reduction does not require a proton relay or the presence of a catalytic zinc ion in contrast to canonical 1,2&#8208;aldehyde reducing ADHs that require the catalytic zinc and a proton relay. Furthermore, ADHs that catalysed 1,2&#8208;iminium reduction required the presence of the catalytic zinc and the loss of the proton relay. This suggests how the ADH active site can be modified to perform atypical carbonyl reductions, providing insight into how chemical reactions are diversified in plant metabolism.

The speed synchronization of two slider&#8208;on&#8208;deck systems, each activating a catalytic unit through circular motion, leads to synergistic effects in the catalytic turnover of a double catalysis.







Abstract
The heteroleptic multi&#8208;component double slider&#8208;on&#8208;deck system DS3 exhibits tight coupling of motional speed of two distinct nano&#8208;circular sliders (k298=77 and 41&#8197;kHz) despite a 2.2&#8197;nm separation. In comparison, the single sliders in DS1 and DS2 move at vastly different speed (k298=1.1 vs. 350&#8197;kHz). Synchronization of the motions in DS3 remains even when one slows the movement of the faster slider using small molecular brake pads. In contrast to the individual DS1 and DS2 systems, DS3 is a powerful catalyst for a two&#8208;step reaction by using the motion of both sliders to drive two catalytic processes.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Benzylation with Photogenerated Hydroxy&#8208;o&#8208;Quinodimethanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic benzylation with 2&#8208;methylbenzophenone derivatives under light irradiation is described. The corresponding nucleophilic photoenols generated under light irradiation, enabled the reaction to take place in reasonable yields (up to 77&#8201;%) and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, without the need for strong bases, or pre&#8208;decoration of the substrates.







Abstract
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic benzylation of aryl vinyl carbinols under light irradiation is described. 2&#8208;Methylbenzophenone derivatives are employed and activated to hydroxy&#8208;o&#8208;quinodimethanes by an ultraviolet (UV) light. This approach enables asymmetric allylic benzylation with high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) from readily available 2&#8208;methylbenzophenones without the utilization of strong bases, and pre&#8208;activation or pre&#8208;functionalization of the substrates. Moreover, deuterium experiments reveal the generation of nucleophilic benzyl species from 2&#8208;methylbenzophenone under UV irradiation.

         <title>Formation of CuMn Prussian Blue Analog Double&#8208;Shelled Nanoboxes Toward Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;substituted Mn&#8208;PBA double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes (CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs) are rationally designed and fabricated through efficient tannic acid etching and cation exchange approaches. Benefiting from the distinctive hollow structures, Cu substitution, and Mn vacancies, the CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs electrode shows improved Zn ion storage properties with high reversible capacity, impressive rate capability, and superior cycling stability.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising candidates for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to their unique open&#8208;framework structures. However, they suffer from limited capacity and severe capacity decay originating from insufficient redox sites and structural instability. Herein, Cu&#8208;substituted Mn&#8208;PBA double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes (CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs) prepared by tannic acid etching and cation exchange approaches are demonstrated for efficient Zn ion storage. The unique hollow structures can expose abundant active sites and alleviate the volume change during the cycling test. Moreover, partial Cu substitution and induced Mn vacancies might inhibit the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions of Mn&#8208;N6 octahedra, thus contributing to the prolonged lifespan. As a result, CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs exhibit high reversible capacity, decent rate performance and superior cycling stability for 2000 cycles. Furthermore, ex situ characterizations reveal that the charge storage mechanism of CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs mainly involves the reversible redox reactions of transition metals and Zn2+ ion insertion/extraction processes.

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated, 2&#8208;chlorothioxanthone (2&#8208;CTX) triplet energy sensitization of simple acrylamides enables facile access to a diverse range of &#946;&#8208;lactam products. The reaction proceeds through triplet sensitization of the C&#8722;C olefin moiety and features a C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization through a biradical carbon&#8208;to&#8208;carbon 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer. The proposed mechanism is supported by deuterium labelling experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8208;azetidinones (&#946;&#8208;lactams) from simple acrylamide starting materials by visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated energy transfer catalysis is reported. The reaction features a C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization via a variation of the Norrish&#8211;Yang photocyclization involving a carbon&#8208;to&#8208;carbon 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (supported by deuterium labelling and DFT calculations) and can be used for the construction of a diverse range of &#946;&#8208;lactam products.

         <title>An Ultraviolet Fluorophore with Narrowed Emission via Coplanar Molecular Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coplanar strategy using indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole (ICZ) simultaneously achieves narrowed emission and ultraviolet (UV) emission in fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), and a synthetic shortcut is carried out to efficiently obtain the target coplanar ICZ derivatives. 11&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole (ICZ&#8208;TAZ) shows UV emission with peaks below 400&#8197;nm and narrowed full width at half maximum (FWHM) both in photoluminescence and electroluminescence, achieving best results among fluorescent UV&#8208;OLEDs.







Abstract
Narrowband emitting fluorophores exhibit immense potentials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity. However, it's still hard to simultaneously realize short&#8208;wavelength ultraviolet (UV) or near ultraviolet emission (NUV) while maintaining a narrowed full width at half maximum (FWHM) value, and rare work focus on such challenging pursuit. Herein, an ingenious synthetic method was devised to achieve emitters with coplanar structure. 11&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole (ICZ&#8208;TAZ) was designed to realize narrowed UV emission both in photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) which benefited from the suppression of vibronic coupling. UV/NUV OLEDs based on ICZ&#8208;TAZ achieve external quantum efficiency (EQE) maximums of 3.26&#8201;% peaks @ 388&#8197;nm and 4.02&#8201;% peaks @ 406&#8197;nm with small FWHM of 32&#8197;nm and 46&#8197;nm, respectively, corresponding with reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off at luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Photoresponsive Dissipative Macrocycles Using Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Switchable Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of fluorinated, visible&#8208;light&#8208;switchable azobenzenes in combination with two different amines, ethylenediamine and R,R&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane, enabled the creation of a library of macrocyclic compounds that include highly strained, metastable, and dissipative systems. These studies give a detailed insight into photoresponsive dissipative systems and the vast potential of using azobenzenes in dynamic covalent chemistry.







Abstract
Visible light can be used to shift dynamic covalent imine assemblies out of equilibrium. We studied a fluorinated azobenzene building block that reliably undergoes geometric isomerism upon irradiation. The building block was used in combination with two different amines, ethylenediamine and R,R&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane, to create a library of imine macrocycles. Whereas the simple amine can be used to access a polymeric state and a defined bowl&#8208;shaped macrocycle, the chiral amine gives access to a rich network of macrocycles that undergo both isomerisation as well as interconversion between different macrocyclic species, thereby allowing for control over the number of monomers involved in the cyclo&#8208;oligomerization; 1H&#8208; and 19F&#8208;DOSY NMR, MALDI&#8208;MS measurements, and UV/Vis spectroscopy were used to study the processes.

&lt;p&gt;Visible light can be used to shift dynamic covalent imine assemblies out of equilibrium. We studied a fluorinated azobenzene building block that reliably undergoes geometric isomerism upon irradiation. The building block was used in combination with two different amines, ethylenediamine and &lt;i&gt;R,R&lt;/i&gt;-1,2-diaminocyclohexane, to create a library of imine macrocycles. Whereas the simple amine can be used to access a polymeric state and a defined bowl-shaped macrocycle, the chiral amine gives access to a rich network of macrocycles that undergo both isomerisation as well as interconversion between different macrocyclic species, thereby allowing for control over the number of monomers involved in the cyclo-oligomerization; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H- and &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F-DOSY NMR, MALDI-MS measurements, and UV/Vis spectroscopy were used to study the processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Oligopeptides by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Radical Addition to Dehydroalanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical addition to the dehydroalanine (Dha) residue of a peptide could diversify the peptide sequence with noncanonical residues, but this strategy is currently limited by the lack of control over the stereochemistry. This work addresses this important challenge by applying chiral nickel catalysts to control the stereoselective radical addition to Dha on oligopeptides.







Abstract
Radical addition to dehydroalanine (Dha) represents an appealing, modular strategy to access non&#8208;canonical peptide analogues for drug discovery. Prior studies on radical addition to the Dha residue of peptides and proteins have demonstrated outstanding functional group compatibility, but the lack of stereoselectivity has limited the synthetic utility of this approach. Herein, we address this challenge by employing chiral nickel catalysts to control the stereoselectivity of radical addition to Dha on oligopeptides. The conditions accommodate a variety of primary and secondary electrophiles to introduce polyethylene glycol, biotin, halo&#8208;tag, and hydrophobic and hydrophilic side chains to the peptide. The reaction features catalyst control to largely override substrate&#8208;based control of stereochemical outcome for modification of short peptides. We anticipate that the discovery of chiral nickel complexes that confer catalyst control will allow rapid, late&#8208;stage modification of peptides featuring nonnatural sidechains.

         <title>Transient Stabilization Effect of CO2 in the Electrochemical Hydrogenation of Azo Compounds and the Reductive Coupling of &#945;&#8208;Ketoesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new transient stabilization effect (TSE) of CO2 is identified and applied to the electrochemical hydrogenation of azo compounds and the reductive coupling of &#945;&#8208;ketoesters. The TSE influence of CO2 means that overactive intermediates can be captured by CO2 to prevent their decomposition or side reaction to complete the synthesis that is difficult to achieve by direct means. The CO2 can be released later through a decarboxylation process.







Abstract
The carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and utilization has attracted a great attention in organic synthesis. Herein, an unpresented transient stabilization effect (TSE) of CO2 is disclosed and well applied to the electrochemical hydrogenation of azo compounds to hydrazine derivatives. Mechanistic experiments and computational studies imply that CO2 can capture azo radical anion intermediates to protect the hydrogenation from potential degradation reactions, and is finally released through decarboxylation. The promotion effect of CO2 was further demonstrated to work in the preliminary study of electrochemical reductive coupling of &#945;&#8208;ketoesters to vicinal diol derivatives. For the electrochemical reductive reactions mentioned above, CO2 is indispensable. The presented results shed light on a different usage of CO2 and could inspire novel experimental design by using CO2 as a transient protecting group.

         <title>A Broadband, Multiplexed&#8208;Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Transport in Composite Flexible&#8208;Organic&#8208;Crystal Waveguide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical integration of three optically different flexible crystal waveguides produces a compact organic wavelength division multiplexer (WDM). This WDM merges three narrow&#8208;band optical signals (blue, cyan, and yellow) to transmit a broadband visible light signal. Such wide bandwidth signal multiplexers open the doors to visible light communication (VLC) technologies.







Abstract
We report the construction of an organic crystal multiplexer using three chemically and optically different acicular, flexible organic crystals for a broadband, visible light signal transportation. The mechanical integration of a highly flexible crystal waveguide of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(7&#8208;methoxybenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)acrylonitrile (BTD2CF3) displaying bright yellow (&#955;1) fluorescence with blue&#8208;emitting (&#955;2) BPP and cyan emitting (&#955;3) DBA crystals using AFM&#8208;tip provides a composite organic crystal multiplexer. The constructed hybrid single crystal multiplexer effectively transduces three optical signals (&#955;1+&#955;2+&#955;3) covering the 420&#8211;750&#8197;nm region as a composite output signal. The presented proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle experiment demonstrates the real potential of organic flexible crystal waveguides for visible light communication technologies.

         <title>Nitrene&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Oxygenation: Catalytic Enantioselective Formation of Five&#8208;Membered Cyclic Organic Carbonates</title>

         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the synthesis of non&#8208;racemic cyclic carbonates from abundant alcohol feedstocks is presented. The method exploits an unusual nitrene&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H oxygenation via a proposed 1,7&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT).







Abstract
The synthesis of non&#8208;racemic 5&#8208;membered cyclic carbonates from abundant alcohols is reported. Conversion of the alcohol into an azanyl carbonate is followed by a chiral&#8208;at&#8208;ruthenium catalyzed cyclization to provide chiral cyclic carbonates in yields of up to 95&#8201;% and with up to 99&#8201;% ee. This new synthetic method is proposed to proceed through a nitrene&#8208;mediated intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H oxygenation which includes an unusual 1,7&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer within a ruthenium nitrene intermediate. The method is applicable to the synthesis of non&#8208;racemic chiral mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisubstituted cyclic alkylene carbonates.

         <title>Fluorinated Tetraarylethenes: Universal Tags for the Synthesis of Solid State Luminogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method for the coupling of fluorinated tetraarylethens to a wide range of substrates is described. The approach allows converting amino acids, bioactive compounds, carbohydrates, steroids, and polymers in one step into solid state luminogens.







Abstract
The aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties of tetraarylethenes (TAEs) have led to numerous applications in chemistry, biology, and materials science. Herein, we describe two fluorinated tetraarylethenes, which can be employed as universal tags for the synthesis of solid state luminogens. The tags are accessible in one or two steps from commercially available starting materials. Facile coupling reactions with ubiquitous substrates such as thiols, alcohols, amines, phosphines, aldehydes, and enamines allow preparing a wide range of TAE conjugates, including tagged amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates, steroids, and commercial polymers.

Facile coupling reactions with ubiquitous substrates such as thiols, alcohols, amines, phosphines, aldehydes, and enamines allow preparing a wide range of TAE conjugates, including tagged amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates, steroids, and commercial polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>pH Dependence of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Fibril Assembly Kinetics: Unravelling the Microscopic Molecular Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 48, November 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Globally fitting different kinetic models of fibril formation, over a range of pHs, reveals the key microscopic molecular processes of amyloid assembly. Primary nucleation is driven by a loss of net charge, while surprisingly, both secondary nucleation and elongation rates are independent of pH.







Abstract
Central to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the assembly of the amyloid&#8208;beta peptide (A&#946;) into fibrils. A reduction in pH accompanying inflammation or subcellular compartments, may accelerate fibril formation as the pH approaches A&#946;&#8217;s isoelectric point (pI). Using global fitting of fibril formation kinetics over a range of pHs, we identify the impact net charge has on individual fibril assembly microscopic rate constants. We show that the primary nucleation has a strong pH dependence. The titration behaviour exhibits a mid&#8208;point or pKa of 7.0, close to the pKa of A&#946; histidine imidazoles. Surprisingly, both the secondary nucleation and elongation rate constants are pH independent. This indicates the charge of A&#946;, in particular histidine protonation, has little impact on this stage of A&#946; assembly. These fundamental processes are key to understanding the forces that drive the assembly of A&#946; into toxic oligomers and fibrils.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylamines are important building blocks in the synthesis of bioactive compounds. The direct coupling of allylic C&#8722;H bonds and commonly available amines is a major synthetic challenge. An allylic C&#8208;H amination of 1,4&#8208;dienes has been accomplished by palladium catalysis. With aromatic amines, branch&#8208;selective allylic aminations are favored to generate thermodynamically unstable Z&#8208;allylamines. In addition, more basic aliphatic cyclic amines can also engage in the reaction, but linear dienyl allylic amines are the major products.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Aerobic Nitrogen Photooxidation on Titania through In Situ Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ and ultrafast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic characterization and computational simulations were employed to elucidate the role of O2 in promoting N2 dissociation through a low&#8208;energy pathway evolving from *OxNy to an *ON intermediate. A TiO2 photocatalyst exhibited outstanding N2 photofixation performance with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;nitrate energy conversion efficiency up to 0.13&#8201;%.







Abstract
Nitrate is an important raw material for chemical fertilizers, but it is industrially manufactured in multiple steps at high temperature and pressure, urgently motivating the design of a green and sustainable strategy for nitrate production. We report the photosynthesis of nitrate from N2 and O2 on commercial TiO2 in a flow reactor under ambient conditions. The TiO2 photocatalyst offered a high nitrate yield of 1.85&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 as well as a solar&#8208;to&#8208;nitrate energy conversion efficiency up to 0.13&#8201;%. We combined reactivity and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to elucidate the mechanism of nitrate formation and unveil the special role of O2 in N&#8801;N bond dissociation. The mechanistic insight into charge&#8208;involved N2 oxidation was further demonstrated by in situ transient absorption spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance. This work exhibits the mechanistic origin of N2 photooxidation and initiates a potential method for triggering inert catalytic reactions.

         <title>Durable Nickel&#8208;Iron (Oxy)hydroxide Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts through Surface Functionalization with Tetraphenylporphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe dissolution is the major deactivation mechanism of Nickel&#8208;Iron (oxy)hydroxide in alkaline oxygen evolution reaction. The water molecule hydrates eluted Fe that easily escape from the double layer. Surface immobilization of tetraphenylporphyrin forms a nonpolar layer that suppresses the penetration of Fe without interrupting the activity. This increases the fraction of Fe redeposition onto the electrode and maintains an active site population.







Abstract
NiFe&#8208;based oxides are one of the best&#8208;known active oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Unfortunately, they rapidly lost performance in Fe&#8208;purified KOH during the reaction. Herein, tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) was loaded on a catalyst/electrolyte interface to alleviate the destabilization of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide. We propose that the degradation occurs primarily due to the release of thermodynamically unstable Fe. TPP acts as a protective layer and suppresses the dissolution of hydrated metal at the catalyst/electrolyte interface. In the electric double layer, the nonpolar TPP layer on the NiFe surface also invigorates the redeposition of the active site, Fe, which leads to prolonging the lifetime of NiFe. The TPP&#8208;coated NiFe was demonstrated in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, where hydrogen was generated at a rate of 126&#8197;L&#8201;h&#8722;1 for 115&#8197;h at a 1.41&#8197;mV&#8201;h&#8722;1 degradation rate. Consequently, TPP is a promising protective layer that could stabilize oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.

The TPP-coated NiFe was demonstrated in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, where hydrogen was generated at a rate of 126&#8197;L&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for 115&#8197;h at a 1.41&#8197;mV&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; degradation rate. Consequently, TPP is a promising protective layer that could stabilize oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioconjugation via Hetero&#8208;Selective Clamping of Two Different Amines with ortho&#8208;Phthalaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino groups are common in both natural and synthetic compounds and offer a very attractive class of endogenous handles for bioconjugation. However, the ability to differentiate two types of amino groups and join them with high hetero&#8208;selectivity and efficiency in a complex setting remains elusive. Herein, we report a new method for bioconjugation via one&#8208;pot chemoselective clamping of two different amine nucleophiles using a simple ortho&#8208;phthalaldehyde (OPA) reagent. Various &#945;&#8208;amino acids, aryl amines, and secondary amines can be crosslinked to the &#949;&#8208;amino side chain of lysine on peptides or proteins with high efficiency and hetero&#8208;selectivity. This method offers a simple and powerful means to crosslink small molecule drugs, imaging probes, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, and even virus particles without any pre&#8208;functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Blue&#8208;to&#8208;UVB Upconversion, Solvent Sensitization and Challenging Bond Activation Enabled by a Benzene&#8208;Based Annihilator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several energy&#8208;demanding photoreactions require harsh UV light from inefficient light sources. The conversion of low&#8208;energy visible light to high&#8208;energy singlet states via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) could offer a solution for driving such reactions under mild conditions. We present the first annihilator with an emission maximum in the UVB region that, combined with an organic sensitizer, is suitable for blue&#8208;to&#8208;UV upconversion. The annihilator singlet was successfully employed as an energy donor in subsequent FRET activations of aliphatic carbonyls. This hitherto unreported UC&#8208;FRET reaction sequence was directly monitored using laser spectroscopy and applied to mechanistic irradiation experiments demonstrating the feasibility of Norrish chemistry. Our results provide clear evidence for a novel blue light&#8208;driven substrate or solvent activation strategy, which is important in the context of developing more sustainable light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutralizing the Impact of the Virulence Factor LecA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa on Human Cells with New Glycomimetic Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial adhesion, biofilm formation and host cell invasion of the ESKAPE pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa require the tetravalent lectins LecA and LecB, which are therefore drug targets to fight these infections. Recently, we have reported highly potent divalent galactosides as specific LecA inhibitors. However, they suffered from very low solubility and an intrinsic chemical instability due to two acylhydrazone motifs, which precluded further biological evaluation. Here, we isosterically substituted the acylhydrazones and systematically varied linker identity and length between the two galactosides necessary for LecA binding. The optimized divalent LecA ligands showed improved stability and were up to 5000&#8208;fold more soluble. Importantly, these properties now enabled their biological characterization. The lead compound L2 potently inhibited LecA binding to lung epithelial cells, restored wound closure in a scratch assay and reduced the invasiveness of P. aeruginosa into host cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Reshaping the 2&#8208;Pyrone Synthase Active Site for Chemoselective Biosynthesis of Polyketides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering enzymes with novel reactivity and applying them in metabolic pathways to produce valuable products are quite challenging due to the intrinsic complexity of metabolic networks and the need for high in vivo catalytic efficiency. Triacetic acid lactone (TAL), naturally generated by 2&#8208;pyrone synthase (2PS), is a platform molecule that can be produced via microbial fermentation and further converted into value&#8208;added products. However, these conversions require extra synthetic steps under harsh conditions. We herein report a biocatalytic system for direct generation of TAL derivatives under mild conditions with controlled chemoselectivity by rationally engineering the 2PS active site and then rewiring the biocatalytic pathway in the metabolic network of E. coli to produce high&#8208;value products, such as kavalactone precursors, with yields up to 17 mg/L culture. Computer modeling indicates sterics and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions play key roles in tuning the selectivity, efficiency and yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Umpolung Synthesis of Pyridyl Ethers by BiV&#8208;Mediated O&#8208;Arylation of Pyridones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that sterically&#8208; and electronically&#8208;diverse pyridyl ethers can be accessed via BiV&#8208;mediated C&#8722;O coupling of 2&#8208; or 4&#8208;pyridones with arylboronic acids. Use of a bismacyclic reagent not only confers modularity on our methodology, but also results in highly regioselective O&#8208;arylation that is unprecedented for BiV.







Abstract
We report that O&#8208;selective arylation of 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;pyridones with arylboronic acids is affected by a modular, bismacycle&#8208;based system. The utility of this umpolung approach to pyridyl ethers, which is complementary to conventional methods based on SNAr or cross&#8208;coupling, is demonstrated through the concise synthesis of Ki6783 and picolinafen, and the formal synthesis of cabozantib and golvatinib. Computational investigations reveal that arylation proceeds in a concerted fashion via a 5&#8208;membered transition state. The kinetically&#8208;controlled regioselectivity for O&#8208;arylation&#8212;which is reversed relative to previous BiV&#8208;mediated pyridone arylations&#8212;is attributed primarily to the geometric constraints imposed by the bismacyclic scaffold.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Hofmeister Anion Selectivity via a Mechanical Bond Effect in Neutral Halogen&#8208;Bonding [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral XB [2]rotaxanes containing remarkably potent XB axle components including a novel 4,6&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;iodotriazole motif are constructed via a discrete chloride anion template directed synthesis. Quantitative 1H NMR halide anion titration studies in competitive aqueous&#8208;organic solvent mixtures reveal the XB [2]rotaxanes display pronounced anti&#8208;Hofmeister halide anion recognition selectivity for chloride over iodide.







Abstract
Exceptionally strong halogen bonding (XB) donor&#8208;chloride interactions are exploited for the chloride anion template synthesis of neutral XB [2]rotaxane host systems which contain perfluoroaryl&#8208;functionalised axle components, including a remarkably potent novel 4,6&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;iodotriazole motif. Halide anion recognition properties in aqueous&#8208;organic media, determined via extensive 1H NMR halide anion titration experiments, reveal the rotaxane host systems exhibit dramatically enhanced affinities for hydrophilic Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;, but conversely diminished affinities for hydrophobic I&#8722;, relative to their non&#8208;interlocked axle counterparts. Crucially, this mechanical bond effect induces a binding selectivity which directly opposes Hofmeister bias. Free&#8208;energy analysis of this mechanical bond enhancement demonstrates anion recognition by neutral XB interlocked host systems as a rare and general strategy to engineer anti&#8208;Hofmeister bias anion selectivity in synthetic receptor design.

         <title>Organic Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery: Planar, &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Quinone&#8208;Based Polymer Endows Ultrafast Ion Diffusion Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel poly(phenazine&#8208;alt&#8208;pyromellitic anhydride) (PPPA) with large &#960;&#8208;conjugated system has been successfully designed and synthesized via a condensation polymerization strategy. Its high molecular planarity originated from &#960;&#8208;conjugated PPPA chains results in ultrafast Zn2+ ion diffusion kinetics. Such a planar configuration with reducing energy gap also effectively accelerates intramolecular electron transfer during charge/discharge process.







Abstract
A novel poly(phenazine&#8208;alt&#8208;pyromellitic anhydride) (PPPA) has been successfully designed and synthesized via a condensation polymerization strategy as promising cathode material in organic zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM), FTIR and XPS characterizations verify a reversible Zn2+&#8208;coordination mechanism in our PPPA cathode. Intriguingly, an ultrahigh Zn2+ diffusion coefficient of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1 was found in this large &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, which is the highest one among all organic cathode materials for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Theoretical calculations reveal the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated plane in our PPPA sample results in a significant reduction on energy gap, effectively accelerating intramolecular electron transfer during charge/discharge process. Our finding provides insights to achieve high zinc&#8208;ion transport kinetics by a design strategy on planar polymer system.

         <title>Increasing the Distance of Adjacent Palladium Atoms for Configuration Matching in Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distance of adjacent Pd atoms is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated to be significant for defining the reaction pathways for selective hydrogenation processes exemplified by acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation here. Increasing the distance favors the formation of ethylene while restrains those of byproducts due to the simultaneously promoted C2H4 desorption and destabilized transition state of C2H3* coupling.







Abstract
Precisely tailoring the distance between adjacent metal sites to match adsorption configurations of key species for the targeted reaction pathway is a great challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we report a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study on the atomically sites&#8208;tailored pathway in Pd&#8208;catalyzed acetylene hydrogenation, i.e., increasing the distance of adjacent Pd atoms (dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd) for configuration matching in acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation against coupling. dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd is identified as a structural descriptor for describing the competitiveness for reaction pathways, and the increased dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd prefers the semi&#8208;hydrogenation pathway due to simultaneously promoted C2H4 desorption and the destabilized transition state of the C2H3* coupling. Spectroscopic, kinetics and electronic structure studies reveal that increasing dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd to 3.31&#8197;&#197; delivers superior selectivity and stability due to energy matching and appropriate hybridization of Pd 4d with In 2s and, especially, 2p orbitals.
