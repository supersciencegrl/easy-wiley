         <title>Enzyme Engineering for High&#8208;Yielding Amide Formation: Lipase&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of N&#8208;Acyl Glycine in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amide syntheses remain a key challenging green chemistry reaction. For instance, green synthesis of N&#8208;acyl glycine as biosurfactants and therapeutics are highly desirable to replace chemical pathway using toxic phosgene. Here, we report a novel concept for enzymatic amidation in an aqueous system via glycerol&#8208;activation of fatty acid and its subsequent aminolysis with glycine to synthesize N&#8208;acyl glycine. We then engineer an enzyme (proRML) by reshaping its catalytic pocket to enhance its aminolysis activity and catalytic efficiency by 103&#8208;fold and 465&#8208;fold, respectively. The evolved proRML (D156S/L258K/L267N/S83D/L58K/R86K/W88V) catalyzed the amidation of fatty acid by glycine to N&#8208;lauroylglycine with high yield (80%). It accepts a broad range of medium to long&#8208;chain fatty acids (C8&#8208;C18), giving high yields of N&#8208;decanoyl, N&#8208;myristoyl, and N&#8208;oleoylglycine. The developed amidation concept may be general, and the engineered enzyme is useful for green synthesis of N&#8208;acyl glycine.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Energy Transfer in A &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework Facilitates Excited&#8208;State Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes excited&#8208;state nickel&#8208;catalyzed borylation and trifluoromethylation reactions in a covalent organic framework (COF). Rapid energy transfer in the sp2&#8208;carbon conjugated COF facilitates the generation of aryl radicals from nickel&#8208;aryl complexes, leading to two orders of magnitude higher catalytic efficiency than the homogeneous counterpart in aryl borylation and trifluoromethylation reactions.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received broad interest owing to their permanent porosity, high stability, and tunable functionalities. COFs with long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;conjugation and photosensitizing building blocks have been explored for sustainable photocatalysis. Herein, we report the first example of COF&#8208;based energy transfer Ni catalysis. A pyrene&#8208;based COF with sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugation was synthesized and used to coordinate NiII centers through bipyridine moieties. Under light irradiation, enhanced energy transfer in the COF facilitated the excitation of Ni centers to catalyze borylation and trifluoromethylation reactions of aryl halides. The COF showed two orders of magnitude higher efficiency in these reactions than its homogeneous control and could be recovered and reused without significant loss of catalytic activity.

         <title>An Aluminum Telluride with a Terminal Al=Te Bond and its Conversion to an Aluminum Tellurocarbonate by CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile isolation of various dimeric aluminum selenides and tellurides, as well as an aluminum&#8208;telluride monomer featuring a terminal Al=Te bond, is reported. The aluminum&#8208;telluride monomer exhibits high thermal stability and reacts with three equivalents of CO2 to form an unprecedented tellurocarbonate [CO2Te]2&#8722; substituted aluminum complex, which is the first example of tellurium analogue of the carbonate [CO3]2&#8722;.







Abstract
Facile access to dimeric heavier aluminum chalcogenides [(NHC)Al(Tipp)&#8208;&#956;&#8208;Ch]2 (NHC=IiPr (1,3&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, IMe4 (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene); Tipp=2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H2; Ch=Se, Te) by treatment of NHC&#8208;stabilized aluminum dihydrides with elemental Se and Te is reported. The higher affinity of IMe4 in comparison with IiPr toward the Al center in [(NHC)Al(Tipp)&#8208;&#956;&#8208;Ch]2 can be used for ligand exchange. Additionally, the presence of excess IMe4 allows for cleavage of the dimers to form a rare example of a neutral multiply bonded heavier aluminum chalcogenide in the form of a tetracoordinate aluminum complex, (IMe4)2(Tipp)Al=Te. This species reacts with three equivalents of CO2 across two Al&#8722;CNHC and the Al=Te bond affording a pentacoordinate aluminum complex containing a dianionic tellurocarbonate ligand [CO2Te]2&#8722;, which is the first example of tellurium analogue of a carbonate [CO3]2&#8722;.

         <title>Confining the Sol&#8208;Gel Reaction at the Water/Oil Interface: Creating Compartmentalized Enzymatic Nano&#8208;Organelles for Artificial Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To mimic the compartmentalization of enzyme reactions in living organisms, in this study we developed an efficient and safe method for in situ encapsulating enzymes in aqueous&#8208;core mesoporous nanocapsules. The enzyme&#8208;carrying nanocapsules, as synthetic nano&#8208;organelles, were able to successfully perform cascade reactions when enveloped in a polymer vesicle, mimicking the hierarchically compartmentalized reactions in the eukaryotic cells.







Abstract
Living organisms compartmentalize their catalytic reactions in membranes for increased efficiency and selectivity. To mimic the organelles of eukaryotic cells, we develop a mild approach for in situ encapsulating enzymes in aqueous&#8208;core silica nanocapsules. In order to confine the sol&#8208;gel reaction at the water/oil interface of miniemulsion, we introduce an aminosilane to the silica precursors, which serves as both catalyst and an amphiphilic anchor that electrostatically assembles with negatively charged hydrolyzed alkoxysilanes at the interface. The semi&#8208;permeable shell protects enzymes from proteolytic attack, and allows the transport of reactants and products. The enzyme&#8208;carrying nanocapsules, as synthetic nano&#8208;organelles, are able to perform cascade reactions when enveloped in a polymer vesicle, mimicking the hierarchically compartmentalized reactions in eukaryotic cells. This in situ encapsulation approach provides a versatile platform for the delivery of biomacromolecules.

         <title>Selective 3,3&#8208;Rearrangement of Azobenzenes upon Complexation by a Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;C bond formation and complete N=N bond rupture in azobenzenes was induced by a heterosiloxane&#8208;type frustrated POSi Lewis pair; the reactivity resembles that of the acid initiated classical benzidine rearrangement, but starting from an N=N double&#8208;bonded system.







Abstract
The reaction of the oxygen&#8208;bridged frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;Si(C2F5)3 (1) and tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;AlBis2 (2) with azobenzene, promoted by UV irradiation, led to a selective complexation of the cis&#8208;isomer. The addition product of 2 is stable, while the adduct of 1 isomerizes in solution in an ortho&#8208;benzidine&#8208;like [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement by cleavage of the N&#8722;N bond, saturation of the nitrogen atoms with hydrogen atoms and formation of a new bond between two phenyl ortho&#8208;carbon atoms. Similar rearrangements take place with different para&#8208;substituted azobenzenes (R=Me, OMe, Cl) and di(2&#8208;naphthyl)diazene, while ortho&#8208;methylated azo compounds do not form adducts with 1. All adducts were characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and elemental analyses and the mechanism of the rearrangement was explored by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.

&lt;p&gt;The reaction of the oxygen-bridged frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&#8722;O&#8722;Si(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&#8722;O&#8722;AlBis&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) with azobenzene, promoted by UV irradiation, led to a selective complexation of the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-isomer. The addition product of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is stable, while the adduct of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; isomerizes in solution in an &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-benzidine-like [3,3]-rearrangement by cleavage of the N&#8722;N bond, saturation of the nitrogen atoms with hydrogen atoms and formation of a new bond between two phenyl &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-carbon atoms. Similar rearrangements take place with different &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-substituted azobenzenes (R=Me, OMe, Cl) and di(2-naphthyl)diazene, while &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-methylated azo compounds do not form adducts with &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. All adducts were characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and elemental analyses and the mechanism of the rearrangement was explored by quantum-chemical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Cytochrome P450BM3 Enzymes for Direct Nitration of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The peroxidase activity of a dual&#8208;functional small&#8208;molecule (DFSM)&#8208;facilitated P450BM3&#8208;H2O2 system was drastically improved through mechanism&#8208;guided protein engineering for the P450&#8208;mediated direct nitration of phenols, anilines, and styrenes using nitrite as the nitrating agent. Co&#8208;crystal structures revealed the crucial role of the steric effect introduced by site&#8208;directed mutations of proximal residues in the regulation of substrate access.







Abstract
Applications of the peroxidase activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes in synthetic chemistry remain largely unexplored. We present herein a protein engineering strategy to increase cytochrome P450BM3 peroxidase activity for the direct nitration of aromatic compounds and terminal aryl&#8208;substituted olefins in the presence of a dual&#8208;functional small molecule (DFSM). Site&#8208;directed mutations of key active&#8208;site residues allowed the efficient regulation of steric effects to limit substrate access and, thus, a significant decrease in monooxygenation activity and increase in peroxidase activity. Nitration of several phenol and aniline compounds also yielded ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;nitration products with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high total turnover numbers. Besides direct aromatic nitration by P450 variants using nitrite as a nitrating agent, we also demonstrated the use of the DFSM&#8208;facilitated P450 peroxidase system for the nitration of the vinyl group of styrene and its derivatives.

         <title>Simultaneous Stabilization of Lithium Anode and Cathode using Hyperconjugative Electrolytes for High&#8208;voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecule descriptors proposed in this work guide a bottom&#8208;up hyperconjugative electrolyte design, which exhibits superior stability for both Li anode and high&#8208;voltage cathode, enables the 4.6&#8197;V Li||LCO full cell (30&#8197;&#956;m Li, 4.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 LCO, low N/P ratio of 1.3) a great performance improvement. The bottom&#8208;up electrolyte design concept opens up a universal strategy for advancing high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
Although great progress has been made in new electrolytes for lithium metal batteries (LMBs), the intrinsic relationship between electrolyte composition and cell performance remains unclear due to the lack of valid quantization method. Here, we proposed the concept of negative center of electrostatic potential (NCESP) and Mayer bond order (MBO) to describe solvent capability, which highly relate to solvation structure and oxidation potential, respectively. Based on established principles, the selected electrolyte with 1.7&#8197;M LiFSI in methoxytrimethylsilane (MOTMS)/ (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (TFMTMS) shows unique hyperconjugation nature to stabilize both Li anode and high&#8208;voltage cathode. The 4.6&#8197;V 30&#8197;&#956;m Li||4.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) (low N/P ratio of 1.3) cell with our electrolyte shows stable cycling with 91&#8201;% capacity retention over 200&#8197;cycles. The bottom&#8208;up design concept of electrolyte opens up a general strategy for advancing high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>Green&#8208;solvent Processable Dopant&#8208;free Hole Transporting Materials for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Star&#8208;shaped donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor structure with 3,5&#8208;dicarbonitrile pyridine core has been developed as an efficient design strategy towards high performance green&#8208;solvent processable dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs). The resulting BTP1 HTM processed by green solvent of 2&#8208;methylanisole, a kind of food additive, shows an impressive efficiency of 24.34&#8201;% based on inverted perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
The commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) urgently requires the development of green&#8208;solvent processable dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs). However, strong intermolecular interactions that ensure high hole mobility always compromise the solubility and film&#8208;forming ability in green solvents. Herein, we show a simple but effective design strategy to solve this trade&#8208;off, that is, constructing star&#8208;shaped D&#8208;A&#8208;D structure. The resulting HTMs (BTP1&#8208;2) can be processed by green solvent of 2&#8208;methylanisole (2MA), a kind of food additive, and show high hole mobility and multiple defect passivation effects. An impressive efficiency of 24.34&#8201;% has been achieved for 2MA&#8208;processed BTP1 based inverted PVSCs, the highest value for green&#8208;solvent processable HTMs so far. Moreover, it is manifested that the charge separation of D&#8208;A type HTMs at the photoinduced excited state can help to passivate the defects of perovskites, indicating a new HTM design insight.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer and Spin&#8208;Flip States: Thriving as Complements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;transfer excited states have been at the focus of inorganic photochemistry for decades, together with their strongest opponents: detrimental metal&#8208;centered states. In recent years, interest in metal&#8208;centered spin&#8208;flip states was reignited by a new type of photoactive chromium(III) complex. This Review delineates similarities and unique features of charge&#8208;transfer and spin&#8208;flip states, from fundamentals to applications.







Abstract
Transition metal complexes with photoactive charge&#8208;transfer excited states are pervasive throughout the literature. In particular, [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine), with its metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer emission, has been established as a key complex. Meanwhile, interest in so&#8208;called spin&#8208;flip metal&#8208;centered states has risen dramatically after the molecular ruby [Cr(ddpd)2]3+ (ddpd=N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dipyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine) led to design principles to access strong, long&#8208;lived emission from photostable chromium(III) complexes. This Review contrasts the properties of emissive charge&#8208;transfer and spin&#8208;flip states by using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and [Cr(ddpd)2]3+ as prototypical examples. We discuss the relevant excited states, the tunability of their energy and lifetimes, and their response to external stimuli. Finally, we identify strengths and weaknesses of charge&#8208;transfer and spin&#8208;flip states in applications such as photocatalysis and circularly polarized luminescence.

Photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction provide a promising way to alleviate energy crisis and environmental issues. This review summarizes recent advances in photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction over metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). In addition, the fundamentals of the semiconductor&#8208;like behavior of MOFs and several advanced characterization techniques to elucidate the photocatalytic process and mechanism are discussed.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting and carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction provide promising solutions to global energy and environmental issues. In recent years, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of crystalline porous solids featuring well&#8208;defined and tailorable structures as well as high surface areas, have captured great interest toward photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction. In this review, the semiconductor&#8208;like behavior of MOFs is first discussed. We then summarize the recent advances in photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction over MOF&#8208;based materials and focus on the unique advantage of MOFs for clarifying the structure&#8208;property relationship in photocatalysis. In addition, some representative characterization techniques have been presented to unveil the photocatalytic kinetics and reaction intermediates in MOF&#8208;based systems. Finally, the challenges, and perspectives for future directions are proposed.

         <title>Annulated Azuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulenes: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Extended azuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene derivatives and their 4,5&#8208;dihydro analogues have been prepared in four synthetic steps or less from commercially available compounds. These molecules exhibit high molar absorption coefficients in the visible region and good charge transport properties in field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
Non&#8208;alternant non&#8208;benzenoid hydrocarbons exhibit very different optical and electronic properties than their well&#8208;studied benzenoid analogues. However, preparing such structures with extended conjugation length, remains challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of azuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene derivatives using a two&#8208;step sequence involving a four&#8208;fold aldol condensation between aromatic dialdehydes and readily available tetrahydropentalene&#8208;2,5&#8208;(1H,3H)&#8208;dione. Molecules with band gap values ranging from 1.69 to 2.14&#8197;eV and molar extinction coefficients (&#1013;) of nearly 3&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 have been prepared. These annulene&#8208;like structures exhibit significant diatropic ring currents (aromatic), as supported by 1H NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) using azuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene derivatives as semiconductors exhibit charge mobility values of up to 0.05&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

         <title>A Switchable Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Absorbing Dye Based on Redox&#8208;Bistable Benzitetraazaporphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bench&#8208;stable, redox&#8208;switchable 18&#960;&#8208; and 20&#960;&#8208;electron benzitetraazaporphyrins are reported. Whereas the 18&#960;&#8208;electron aromatic form does not show near&#8208;IR absorption, the antiaromatic 20&#960;&#8208;electron form unexpectedly shows intense near&#8208;IR absorption owing to an electric&#8208;dipole&#8208;allowed HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition resulting from symmetry&#8208;lowering of the porphyrin skeleton. The redox process is reversible and switching can be repeated multiple times.







Abstract
Activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes responsive to external stimuli are used in medical and other applications. Here, we describe the design and synthesis of bench&#8208;stable 18&#960;&#8208; and 20&#960;&#8208;electron benzitetraazaporphyrins (BzTAPs) possessing redox&#8208;switchable NIR properties. X&#8208;Ray, NMR, and UV/Visible&#8208;NIR analyses revealed that 20&#960;&#8208;electron BzTAP 1 exhibits NIR absorption and antiaromaticity with a paratropic ring&#8208;current, while 18&#960;&#8208;electron BzTAP 2 shows weakly aromatic character with NIR inertness. Notably, the NIR&#8208;silent BzTAP 2 was readily converted to the NIR&#8208;active BzTAP 1 in the presence of mild reducing agents such as amine. The intense NIR absorption band of BzTAP 1 is in sharp contrast to the very weak absorption bands of previously reported antiaromatic porphyrinoids. Molecular orbital analysis revealed that symmetry&#8208;lowering perturbation of the 20&#960;&#8208;electron porphyrinoid skeleton enables the HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition of 1 to be electric&#8208;dipole&#8208;allowed. BzTAPs are expected to be useful for constructing activatable NIR probes working in reductive environments.

         <title>Complementary Design in Multicomponent Electrocatalysts for Electrochemical Nitrogen Reduction: Beyond the Leverage in Activity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complementary design in multicomponent electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction. By integrating distinct yet complementary electronic structures of elements in different blocks, this concept is revolutionary in that it breaks the limitations of scaling relations, synchronously achieving high activity and selectivity for electrochemical nitrogen reduction.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is promising in place of the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for artificial N2 fixation. However, the high activity and selectivity of eNRR are challenging to achieve simultaneously due to the scaling relations. Such &#8220;leverage&#8221; between activity and selectivity has severely restricted eNRR. To overcome this bottleneck, the complementary design of electronic structures in multicomponent electrocatalysts has been recently pursued, aiming to maximize the advantages of each component and optimize the multistep reactions, which has stood at the cutting edge in this aspect. Here, we present a minireview of the design, performance, and mechanism of multicomponent electrocatalysts with complementary electronic structures. We particularly emphasize the interactions between N2 and elements from d&#8208;, p&#8208;, and s&#8208;blocks, which are essential for understanding how these electrocatalysts are beyond the &#8220;leverage&#8221; between activity and selectivity.

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Crystalline Supramolecular Assemblies Built with Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the advancements in the field of macrocycle&#8208;based crystalline charge&#8208;transfer assemblies, including their preparation, structures, and diverse supramolecular functions and applications, such as vapochromic behavior and supramolecular tessellations, arising from the CT state. Future perspectives and challenges of this emerging research field are also presented.







Abstract
Synthetic macrocycles have served as principal tools for supramolecular chemistry, have greatly extended the scope of organic charge transfer (CT) complexes, and have proved to be of great practical value in the solid state during the past few years. In this Minireview, we summarize the research progress on the macrocycle&#8208;based crystalline supramolecular assemblies primarily driven by intermolecular CT interactions (a.k.a. macrocycle&#8208;based crystalline CT assemblies, MCCAs for short), which are classified by their donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) constituent elements, including simplex macrocyclic hosts, heterogeneous macrocyclic hosts, and host&#8211;guest D&#8208;A pairs. Particular attention will be focused on their diverse functions and applications, as well as the underlying CT mechanisms from the perspective of crystal engineering. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospects are outlined.

         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;dot (CD)&#8208;based proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have been developed to recognize and bind programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) distributed in tumor cells and recruit the cereblon (CRBN) for PD&#8208;L1 degradation. These nanosized PROTACs can efficiently accumulate at the tumor site and activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, leading to augmented cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) technology is an emerging approach to degrade disease&#8208;associated proteins. Here, we report carbon&#8208;dot (CD)&#8208;based PROTACs (CDTACs) that degrade membrane proteins via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. CDTACs can bind to programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), recruit cereblon (CRBN) to induce PD&#8208;L1 ubiquitination, and degrade them with proteasomes. Fasting&#8208;mimicking diet (FMD) is also used to enhance the cellular uptake and proteasome activity. More than 99&#8201;% or 90&#8201;% of PD&#8208;L1 in CT26 or B16&#8208;F10 tumor cells can be degraded by CDTACs, respectively. Furthermore, CDTACs can activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway to trigger immune responses. Thus, CDTACs with FMD treatment effectively inhibit the growth of CT26 and B16&#8208;F10 tumors. Compared with small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based PROTACs, CDTACs offer several advantages, such as efficient membrane protein degradation, targeted tumor accumulation, immune system activation, and in vivo detection.

         <title>A Triptycene&#8208;Based 2D MOF with Vertically Extended Structure for Improving the Electrocatalytic Performance of CO2 to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional vertically conductive metal&#8208;organic framework (2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF(Cu)) was designed and synthesized with a hexahydroxyltriptycene ligand, which features a vertically extended structure. The 2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF(Cu) exhibits a two&#8208;fold Faradaic efficiency improvement than the planarly extended 2D conductive MOFs, displaying the potential of the structural design in the catalytic performance enhancement.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs) have attracted extensive attention owing to their unique structures and physical&#8208;chemical properties. However, the planarly extended structure of 2D&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs usually limited the accessibility of the active sites. Herein, we designed a triptycene&#8208;based 2D vertically conductive MOF (2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF) by coordinating 2,3,6,7,14,15&#8208;hexahydroxyltriptycene (HHTC) with Cu2+. The vertically extended 2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF(Cu) possesses a weak interlayer interaction, which leads to a facile exfoliation to the nanosheet. Compared with the classical 2D&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs with planarly extended 2D structures, 2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF(Cu) exhibits a 100&#8201;% increased catalytic activity in terms of turnover number and a two&#8208;fold increased selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that higher activity originated from the lower energy barriers of the vertically extended 2D structures during the CO2 reduction reaction process.

         <title>Enhancing Built&#8208;in Electric Fields for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Encapsulating C60 Fullerene into Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated C60 molecules are encapsulated in a Zr&#8208;based NU&#8208;901 metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) to obtain a C60@NU&#8208;901 composite. Host&#8208;guest interactions amplify the irregular charge distribution of the system, giving rise to an enhanced built&#8208;in electric field that promotes efficient charge separation and transportation of carriers. The composite mediates photocatalytic H2 production under visible light.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts based on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are often limited by poor charge separation and slow charge&#8208;transfer kinetics. Herein, a novel MOF photocatalyst is successfully constructed by encapsulating C60 into a nano&#8208;sized zirconium&#8208;based MOF, NU&#8208;901. By virtue of host&#8208;guest interactions and uneven charge distribution, a substantial electrostatic potential difference is set&#8208;up in C60@NU&#8208;901. The direct consequence is a robust built&#8208;in electric field, which tends to be 10.7&#8197;times higher in C60@NU&#8208;901 than that found in NU&#8208;901. In the catalyst, photogenerated charge carriers are efficiently separated and transported to the surface. For example, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaches 22.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for C60@NU&#8208;901, which is among the highest values for MOFs. Our concept of enhancing charge separation by harnessing host&#8208;guest interactions constitutes a promising strategy to design photocatalysts for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.

         <title>Machine Learning Informs RNA&#8208;Binding Chemical Space
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA is increasingly considered a therapeutic target of interest for small molecules. We report an in&#8208;depth analysis of 36 high throughput small molecule microarray screens against nucleic acid targets. Development of machine learning algorithms revealed a complex set of physicochemical properties that can distinguish between RNA&#8208; and protein&#8208;binding drug&#8208;like small molecules.







Abstract
Small molecule targeting of RNA has emerged as a new frontier in medicinal chemistry, but compared to the protein targeting literature our understanding of chemical matter that binds to RNA is limited. In this study, we reported Repository Of BInders to Nucleic acids (ROBIN), a new library of nucleic acid binders identified by small molecule microarray (SMM) screening. The complete results of 36 individual nucleic acid SMM screens against a library of 24&#8201;572 small molecules were reported (including a total of 1&#8201;627&#8201;072 interactions assayed). A set of 2&#8201;003 RNA&#8208;binding small molecules was identified, representing the largest fully public, experimentally derived library of its kind to date. Machine learning was used to develop highly predictive and interpretable models to characterize RNA&#8208;binding molecules. This work demonstrates that machine learning algorithms applied to experimentally derived sets of RNA binders are a powerful method to inform RNA&#8208;targeted chemical space.

         <title>Record Ultralarge&#8208;Pores, Low Density Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework for Controlled Drug Delivery
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Record ultralarge&#8208;pores (47&#8197;&#197;), low density (0.106&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) three&#8208;dimensional non&#8208;interpenetrated stp net COF, TUS&#8208;64, was obtained by reticulating a 6&#8208;connected triptycene&#8208;based linker with a 4&#8208;connected porphyrin&#8208;based linker. TUS&#8208;64 displayed the significant qualities of a drug delivery vehicle: controlled release kinetics, sustained delivery, and site&#8208;specific targeting.







Abstract
The unique structural characteristics of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) like high surface areas, interconnected pore system and readily accessible active sites render them promising platforms for a wide set of functional applications. Albeit promising, the reticular construction of 3D COFs with large pores is a very demanding task owing to the formation of interpenetrated frameworks. Herein we report the designed synthesis of a 3D non&#8208;interpenetrated stp net COF, namely TUS&#8208;64, with the largest pore size of all 3D COFs (47&#8197;&#197;) and record&#8208;low density (0.106&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) by reticulating a 6&#8208;connected triptycene&#8208;based linker with a 4&#8208;connected porphyrin&#8208;based linker. Characterized with a highly interconnected mesoporous scaffold and good stability, TUS&#8208;64 shows efficient drug loading and controlled release for five different drugs in simulated body fluid environment, demonstrating the competency of TUS&#8208;64 as drug nanocarriers.

Herein we report the designed synthesis of a 3D non-interpenetrated &lt;b&gt;stp&lt;/b&gt; net COF, namely TUS-64, with the largest pore size of all 3D COFs (47&#8197;&#197;) and record-low density (0.106&#8197;g&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) by reticulating a 6-connected triptycene-based linker with a 4-connected porphyrin-based linker. Characterized with a highly interconnected mesoporous scaffold and good stability, TUS-64 shows efficient drug loading and controlled release for five different drugs in simulated body fluid environment, demonstrating the competency of TUS-64 as drug nanocarriers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Predicting Highly Enantioselective Catalysts Using Tunable Fragment Descriptors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast and robust predictive models using flexible 2D fragment descriptors, particularly suited for asymmetric catalysis, are described. From training data with only moderate selectivities, highly enantioselective catalysts were predicted and validated, enabling a catalytic asymmetric construction of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydropyrans.







Abstract
Catalyst optimization processes typically rely on inductive and qualitative assumptions of chemists based on screening data. While machine learning models using molecular properties or calculated 3D structures enable quantitative data evaluation, costly quantum chemical calculations are often required. In contrast, readily available binary fingerprint descriptors are time&#8208; and cost&#8208;efficient, but their predictive performance remains insufficient. Here, we describe a machine learning model based on fragment descriptors, which are fine&#8208;tuned for asymmetric catalysis and represent cyclic or polyaromatic hydrocarbons, enabling robust and efficient virtual screening. Using training data with only moderate selectivities, we designed theoretically and validated experimentally new catalysts showing higher selectivities in a challenging asymmetric tetrahydropyran synthesis.

         <title>Correlating the Experimentally Determined CO Adsorption Enthalpy with the Electrochemical CO Reduction Performance on Cu Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spectroscopic method was developed to measure the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO on Cu surfaces at electrochemical conditions. The adsorption enthalpy of CO on dendritic Cu at &#8722;0.75&#8197;VSHE was determined to be 1.5&#177;0.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Measured CO adsorption enthalpies on two different Cu electrodes were correlated with their activities in the electrochemical reduction of CO.







Abstract
CO binding energy has been widely employed as a descriptor for effective catalysts in the electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction reactions (CO(2)RR), however, it has yet to be determined experimentally at electrochemical interfaces due to the lack of suitable techniques. In this work, we developed a method to determine the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO on Cu surfaces with quantitative surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy. On dendritic Cu at &#8722;0.75&#8197;V vs. SHE, the standard adsorption enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy were determined to 1.5&#177;0.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, &#8776;37.9&#177;13.4&#8197;J/(mol&#8201;K), and &#8776;&#8722;9.8&#177;4.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. Comparison of the standard adsorption enthalpy of oxide&#8208;derived Cu and dendritic Cu, as well as their CORR activities, suggests the presence of stronger binding sites on OD Cu, which could favor multicarbon products. The method developed in this work will help establish the correlation between the CO binding energy and the CO(2)RR activity.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Bi Nanosheets Promote CO2&#8901;&#8722; Formation for High&#8208;Performance and pH&#8208;Universal Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a rational electronic structure manipulation strategy, electron&#8208;rich Bi nanosheets are obtained. Compared to electron&#8208;neutral Bi, the electron&#8208;rich Bi favors the formation of CO2&#8901;&#8722; intermediate to activate CO2 molecules, thus leading to its superior electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate with high activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to chemical fuels such as formate offers a promising pathway to carbon&#8208;neutral future, but its practical application is largely inhibited by the lack of effective activation of CO2 molecules and pH&#8208;universal feasibility. Here, we report an electronic structure manipulation strategy to electron&#8208;rich Bi nanosheets, where electrons transfer from Cu donor to Bi acceptor in bimetallic Cu&#8722;Bi, enabling CO2RR towards formate with concurrent high activity, selectivity and stability in pH&#8208;universal (acidic, neutral and alkaline) electrolytes. Combined in situ Raman spectra and computational calculations unravel that electron&#8208;rich Bi promotes CO2&#8901;&#8722; formation to activate CO2 molecules, and enhance the adsorption strength of *OCHO intermediate with an up&#8208;shifted p&#8208;band center, thus leading to its superior activity and selectivity of formate. Further integration of the robust electron&#8208;rich Bi nanosheets into III&#8211;V&#8208;based photovoltaic solar cell results in an unassisted artificial leaf with a high solar&#8208;to&#8208;formate (STF) efficiency of 13.7&#8201;%.

         <title>Poly&#8208;Hydride [AuI7(PPh3)7H5](SbF6)2 cluster complex: Structure, Transformation, and Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[Au7(PPh3)7H5](SbF6)2 (Au7H52+), a poly&#8208;hydride AuI cluster complex containing five hydride ligands, is prepared. Upon exposure to light (300 to 450&#8197;nm) it decomposes to give [Au8(PPh3)7]2+ (Au82+). The two nanoclusters behaved differently in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR): Au7H52+ exhibited 98.2&#8201;% selectivity for H2, whereas Au82+ was selective for CO (73.5&#8201;%).







Abstract
Hydride AuI bonds are labile due to the mismatch in electric potential of an oxidizing metal and reducing ligand, and therefore the structure and structure&#8211;activity relationships of nanoclusters that contain them are seldom studied. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of [Au7(PPh3)7H5](SbF6)2 (abbrev. Au7H52+), an Au cluster complex containing five hydride ligands, which decomposed to give [Au8(PPh3)7]2+ (abbrev. Au82+) upon exposure to light (300 to 450&#8197;nm). The valence state of AuI and H&#8722; was verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, NMR, UV/Vis and XPS. The two nanoclusters behaved differently in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR): Au7H52+ exhibited 98.2&#8201;% selectivity for H2, whereas Au82+ was selective for CO (73.5&#8201;%). Further DFT calculations showed that the H&#8722; ligand inhibited the CO2RR process compared with the electron&#8208;donor H.

         <title>One&#8208;Handed Helical Tubular Ladder Polymers for Chromatographic Enantioseparation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;free tightly&#8208;twisted single&#8208;handed helical tubular ladder polymers with a highly &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich cylindrical helical cavity were synthesized thorough the quantitative and chemoselective helical ladderization of the rationally&#8208;designed precursor polymers. The resulting helical tubular ladder polymers showed remarkably high enantioseparation abilities toward a variety of chiral hydrophobic aromatics with point, axial, and planar chiralities.







Abstract
Defect&#8208;free one&#8208;handed contracted helical tubular ladder polymers with a &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich cylindrical helical cavity were synthesized by alkyne benzannulations of the random&#8208;coil precursor polymers containing 6,6&#8242;&#8208;linked&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane&#8208;7,7&#8242;&#8208;diol&#8208;based chiral monomer units. The resulting tightly&#8208;twisted helical tubular ladder polymers showed remarkably high enantioseparation abilities toward a variety of chiral hydrophobic aromatics with point, axial, and planar chiralities. The random&#8208;coil precursor polymer and analogous rigid&#8208;rod extended helical ribbon&#8208;like ladder polymer with no internal helical cavity exhibited no resolution abilities. The molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich cylindrical helical cavity formed in the tightly&#8208;twisted tubular helical ladder structures is of key importance for producing the highly&#8208;enantioseparation ability, by which chiral aromatics can be enantioselectively encapsulated by specific &#960;&#8208;&#960; and/or hydrophobic interactions.

         <title>Photocatalytic Carboxylation of C&#8722;N Bonds in Cyclic Amines with CO2 by Consecutive Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic carboxylation of C&#8722;N bonds in cyclic amines with CO2 is realized by consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (ConPET). This mild and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol provides a general and practical route to valuable &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, &#948;&#8208; and &#1013;&#8208;amino acids.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light photocatalytic carboxylation with CO2 is highly important. However, it still remains challenging for reluctant substrates with low reduction potentials. Herein, we report a novel photocatalytic carboxylation of C&#8722;N bonds in cyclic amines with CO2 via consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (ConPET). It is also the first photocatalytic reductive ring&#8208;opening reaction of azetidines, pyrrolidines and piperidines. This strategy is practical to transform a variety of easily available cyclic amines to valuable &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, &#948;&#8208; and &#1013;&#8208;amino acids in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Moreover, the method also features mild and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, high selectivity, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, facile scalability and product derivations. Mechanistic studies indicate that the ConPET might be the key to generating highly reactive photocatalysts, which enable the reductive activation of cyclic amines to generate carbon radicals and carbanions as the key intermediates.

BTO/MoS2@CA, with the integration of charges&#8208;enhanced enzymatic activity, pH&#8208;responsive CA release&#8208;mediated H2O2&#160;self&#8208;supply and GSH depletion, enables out&#8208;of&#8208;balance redox homeostasis, leading to effective tumor ferroptosis. As demonstrated by Yawei Lv, Xin Yu, Jing Liu, Chunying Chen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202217448), charges are one of the important&#160;contributing factors for nanozyme activity, which has not been mentioned previously.

         <title>New Oxyhalide Solid Electrolytes with High Lithium Ionic Conductivity &gt;10 mS/cm for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) with inorganic solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted significant interest as next&#8208;generation energy storage. Halides such as Li3YCl6 are promising candidates for SE because they combine high oxidation stability and deformability. However, the ionic conductivities of halide SEs are not as high as those of other SEs, especially sulfides. Here, we discover new lithium&#8208;metal&#8208;oxy&#8208;halide materials, LiMOCl4 (M = Nb, Ta). They exhibit extremely high ionic conductivities of 10.4 mS/cm for M = Nb and 12.4 mS/cm for M = Ta, respectively, even in cold&#8208;pressed powder forms at room temperature, which are comparable to or surpass those of organic liquid electrolytes used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Bulk&#8208;type ASSB cells using the oxyhalides as the cathode SE demonstrate an outstanding rate capability with a capacity retention of 80% at 5 C/0.1 C. We believe that the proposed oxyhalides are promising SE candidates for the practical applications of ASSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboxylic Acid Salts as Dual&#8208;Function Reagents for Carboxylation and Carbon Isotope Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potassium salts of carboxylic acids are developed as efficient carboxylating agents through CO2 exchange. We describe these carboxylates as dual&#8208;function reagents because they function as a combined source of CO2 and base/metalating agent. By using the salt of a commercially available carboxylic acid, this protocol overcomes difficulties when using CO2 gas or organometallic reagents, such as pressurized containers or strictly inert conditions. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, does not require transition metals or other additives, and shows broad substrate scope. Through the preparation of several biologically important molecules, we show how this strategy provides an opportunity for isotope labeling with low equivalents of labeled CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Helicity Induction and Memory in Polyallene toward Circularly Polarized Luminescence, Helicity Discrimination, and Enantiomer Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by biological helices (e.g., DNA), artificial helical polymers have attracted intense attention. However, precise synthesis of one&#8208;handed helices from achiral materials remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a series of achiral poly(biphenyl allene)s with controlled molar mass and low dispersity were prepared and induced into one&#8208;handed helices using chiral amines or alcohols. The induced one&#8208;handed helix was simultaneously memorized, even after the chiral inducer was removed. The switchable induction processes were visible to naked eye; the achiral polymers exhibited blue emission (irradiated at 365 nm), whereas the induced one&#8208;handed helices exhibited cyan emission with clear circularly polarized luminescence. The helices formed stable gels in various solvents with helicity discrimination ability: the same&#8208;handed helix gels were self&#8208;healing, whereas the gels of opposite&#8208;handed helicity were self&#8208;sorted. Moreover, the induced helices could separate enantiomers via enantioselective crystallization with high efficiency and switchable enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Pulsed Electrocatalysis Enabling High Overall Nitrogen Fixation Performance for Atomically Dispersed Fe on TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed Fe was designed on TiO2 and explored as a Janus electrocatalyst for both NOR and NRR in a two&#8208;electrode system. Pulsed electrochemical catalysis (PE) was firstly involved to inhibit the competitive OER and HER. Excitingly, an unanticipated yield of 7055.81 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1cat. and 12868.33 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1cat. were obtained for NOR and NRR at 3.5 V, respectively, 44.94 times and 7.8 times increase in FE than the conventional constant voltage electrocatalytic method. Experiments and DFT calculations revealed that the single&#8208;atom Fe could stabilize the oxygen vacancy, lower the energy barrier for the vital rupture of N&#8801;N, and result in enhanced N2 fixation performance. More importantly, PE could effectively enhance the N2 supply by reducing competitive O2 and H2 agglomeration, inhibit the electrocatalytic by&#8208;product formation for longstanding *OOH and *H intermediates, and promote the non&#8208;electrocatalytic process of N2 activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Super&#8208;Sized Metal Inorganic&#8208;Organic Hybrid Glass with Supramolecular Network via Suppressing Crystallization Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glassy metal coordination compounds (MCC) [e.g., metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), coordination polymer, and metal inorganic&#8208;organic complex (MIOC)] are emerging members of the hybrid glass family. So far, a limited number of crystalline MCCs can be converted into glasses by the melt&#8208;quenching. Here, we report a universal wet&#8208;chemistry method, by which the super&#8208;sized supramolecular MIOC glasses can be synthesized from non&#8208;meltable MOFs. Alcohol and acid were used as agents to inhibit crystallization. The MIOC glasses demonstrate unique features including high transparency, shaping capability, and anisotropic network. Directional photoluminescence with a large polarization ratio (~47%) was observed from samples doped with organic dyes. This crystallization&#8208;suppressing approach enables fabrication of MCC glasses, which cannot be achieved by conventional vitrification methods, and thus allows for exploring new MCC glasses possessing photonic functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Cathode Electrolyte Interphase (CEI) Enables Mo6S8 with Fast Interfacial Magnesium&#8208;Ion Transfer Kinetic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium (Mg) metal secondary batteries have attracted much attention for their high safety and high energy density characteristics. However, the significant issues of the cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) in Mg batteries are still being ignored. In this work, a significant CEI layer on the typical Mo6S8 cathode surface has been unprecedentedly constructed through the oxidation of the chloride&#8208;free magnesium tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy)borate (Mg[B(hfip)4]2) salt under a proper charge cut&#8208;off voltage condition. The CEI has been identified to contain BxOy effective species originating from the oxidation of [B(hfip)4]&#8722; anion. It is confirmed that the BxOy species is beneficial to the desolvation of solvated Mg2+, speeding up the interfacial Mg2+ transfer kinetics, thereby improving the Mg2+&#8208;storage capability of Mo6S8 hosts. The firstly reported CEI in Mg batteries will give deeper insights into the interface issues in multivalent electrochemical systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Cascades Combining Biocatalysis and Transition Metal Catalysis for Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of catalytic methods provides multiple advantages in organic synthesis, allowing access to diverse organic molecules in a straightforward manner. Merging metal and enzyme catalysis is currently receiving great attention due to the possibility to assemble metal catalysis in C&#8211;C coupling, olefin metathesis, hydration and other reactions with the exquisite stereospecificity displayed by enzymes. Thus, this minireview is organized based on the action of the metal species (Pd, Ru, Au, Ir, Fe&#8230;) in combination with different enzymes. Special attention will be paid to the design of sequential processes and concurrent cascades, presenting solutions such as the use of surfactants or compartmentalization strategies for those cases where incompatibilities could hamper the overall process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Dinitrogen (N2) activation and functionalization is of fundamental interest and practical importance. This review focuses on N2 activation and addition to unsaturated substrates, including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, heteroallenes, aldehydes, ketones, acid halides, nitriles, alkynes, and allenes, mediated by transition metal complexes, which afforded a variety of N&#8211;C bond formation products. Emphases are placed on the reaction modes and mechanisms. We hope that this work would stimulate further explorations in this challenging field.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailorable and Biocompatible Supramolecular&#8208;Based Hydrogels Featuring two Dynamic Covalent Chemistries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) has proven to be a valuable tool in creating fascinating molecules, structures, and emergent properties in fully synthetic systems. Here we report a system that uses two dynamic covalent bonds in tandem, namely disulfides and hydrazones, for the formation of hydrogels containing biologically relevant ligands. The reversibility of disulfide bonds allows fiber formation upon oxidation of dithiol&#8208;peptide building block, while the reaction between NH&#8208;NH2 functionalized C&#8208;terminus and aldehyde cross&#8208;linkers results in a gel. The same bond&#8208;forming reaction was exploited for the &#8220;decoration&#8221; of the supramolecular assemblies by cell&#8208;adhesion&#8208;promoting sequences (RGD and LDV). Fast triggered gelation, cytocompatibility and ability to &#8220;on&#8208;demand&#8221; chemically customize fibrillar scaffold offer potential for applying these systems as a bioactive platform for cell culture and tissue engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Exfoliated 2D Layered and Nonlayered Metal Phosphorous Trichalcogenides Nanosheets as Promising Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials catalysts provide an atomic scale view on fascinating arena for understanding the mechanism of electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2 ECR). Here, we successfully exfoliated both layered and nonlayered ultra&#8208;thin metal phosphorous trichalcogenides (MPCh3) nanosheets via wet grinding exfoliation (WGE), and systematically investigated the mechanism of MPCh3 as catalysts for CO2 ECR. Unlike the layered CoPS3 and NiPS3 nanosheets, the active Sn atoms tend to be exposed on the surfaces of nonlayered SnPS3 nanosheets. Correspondingly, the nonlayered SnPS3 nanosheets exhibit clearly improved catalytic activity, showing formic acid selectivity up to 31.6% with &#8208;7.51 mA cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;0.65 V vs. RHE. The enhanced catalytic performance can be attributed to the formation of HCOO* via the first proton&#8208;electron pair addition on the SnPS3 surface. These results provide a new avenue to understand novel CO2 ECR mechanism of Sn&#8208;based and MPCh3&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion Co&#8208;storage in Porous Organic Frameworks through On&#8208;site Coulomb Interactions for High Energy and Power Density Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fast and continuous ion insertion is blocked in the common electrodes operating with widely accepted single&#8208;ion storage mechanism, primarily due to Coulomb repulsion between the same ions. It results in an irreconcilable conflict between capacity and rate performance. Herein, we designed a porous organic framework with novel multiple&#8208;ion co&#8208;storage modes, including PF6&#8722;/Li+, OTF&#8722;/Mg2+, and OTF&#8722;/Zn2+ co&#8208;storage. The Coulomb interactions between cationic and anionic carriers in the framework can significantly promote electrode kinetics, by rejuvenating fast ion carrier migration toward framework interior. Consequently, the framework via PF6&#8722;/Li+ co&#8208;storage mode shows a high energy density of 878 Wh/kg cycled more than 20000 cycles, with an excellent power density of 28 kW/kg that is already comparable to commercial supercapacitors. The both greatly improved energy and power densities via the co&#8208;storage mode may pave a way for exploring new electrodes that are not available from common single&#8208;ion electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Deuterodehalogenation Under Net Reductive or Redox&#8208;Neutral Conditions Enabled by Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interest in deuterated active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is increasing as deuteration holds promise for kinetic isotope effect (KIE) regulated fine&#8208;tuning of API performance. Moreover, deuterium isotope labeling is frequently carried out to study organic and bioorganic reaction mechanisms and to facilitate complex target synthesis. As such, methods for highly selective deuteration of organic molecules are highly desirable. Herein, we present an electrochemical method for the selective deuterodehalogenation of benzylic halides via a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism, using inexpensive deuterium oxide (D2O) as the deuterium source. We demonstrate broad functional group compatibility across a range of aryl and heteroaryl benzylic halides. Furthermore, we uncover a sequential paired electrolysis regime, which permits switching between net reductive and overall redox&#8208;neutral reactions of sulfur&#8208;containing substrates simply by changing the identity of the sacrificial reductant employed.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2&#8208;Fueled Transient Breathing Nanogels that Couple Nonequilibrium Catalytic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present a "breathing"&#160;nanogel that is fueled by CO2 gas to perform temporally programmable catalytic polymerization. The nanogel is composed of common frustrated Lewis pair polymers (FLPs). Dynamic CO2&#8208;FLP gas&#8208;bridging bonds endow the nanogel with a transient volume contraction, and the resulting proximal effect of bound FLPs unlocks its catalytic capacity toward CO2. Reverse gas depletion via a CO2&#8208;participated polymerization can induce a reverse nanogel expansion, which shuts down the catalytic activity. Control of external factors (fuel level, temperature or additives) can regulate the breathing period, amplitude and lifecycle, so as to affect the catalytic polymerization. Moreover, editing the nanogel breathing procedure can sequentially evoke the copolymerization of CO2 with different epoxide monomers preloaded therein, which allows to obtain block&#8208;tunable copolycarbonates that are unachievable by other methods. This synthetic dissipative system would be function as a prototype of gas&#8208;driven nanosynthesizer.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquid Electrolyte with Weak Solvating Molecule Regulation for Stable Li Deposition in High&#8208;Performance Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8211;O2 batteries with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide&#8208;based ionic liquid (TFSI&#8208;IL) electrolyte are promising because TFSI&#8208;IL can stabilize O2&#8211; to lower charge overpotential. However, slow Li+ transport in TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte causes inferior Li deposition. Here we optimize weak solvating molecule (anisole) to generate anisole&#8208;doped ionic aggregate in TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte. Such unique solvation environment can realize not only high Li+ transport parameters but also anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Thus, fast Li+ transport is achieved in electrolyte bulk and SEI simultaneously, leading to robust Li deposition with high rate capability (3 mA cm&#8211;2) and long cycle life (2000 h at 0.2 mA cm&#8211;2). Moreover, Li&#8211;O2 batteries show good cycling stability (a small overpotential increase of 0.16 V after 120 cycles) and high rate capability (1 A g&#8211;1). This work provides an effective electrolyte design principle to realize stable Li deposition and high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;O2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Activated Long Persistent Luminescence of Organic Inorganic Metal Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Long persistent luminescence (LPL) materials of SrAl2O4 doped with Eu2+ or Dy3+ can maintain emission over hours after ceasing the excitation but suffer from insolubility, high cost, and harsh preparation. Recently, organic LPL of guest&#8208;host exciplex systems has been demonstrated via an intermediate charge&#8208;separated state with flexible design but poor air&#8208;stability. Here, we synthesized a nontoxic two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic metal hybrid halides (OIMHs), called PBA2[ZnX4] with X = Br or Cl and PBA = 4&#8208;phenylbenzylamine. These materials exhibit stable LPL emission over minutes at room&#8208;temperature, which is two orders of magnitude longer than those of previously reported OIMHs. The mechanism study shows that the LPL emission comes from thermally activated charge separation state rather than room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. Moreover, the LPL of PBA2[ZnX4] can be excited by low power sources, representing an effective strategy for developing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;stability LPL systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrathin covalent organic framework (COF) membranes are urgently demanded in molecular/ionic separations. Herein, we reported an electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy to fabricate ultrathin COF membranes with thickness of 85 nm, by actively manipulate self&#8208;healing effect and self&#8208;inhibiting effect. The resulting COF membrane exhibited superior performance in brine desalination with the permeation flux of 92 kg m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 and the rejection of 99.96%. Our electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy enriches the fabrication approach of COF membranes and facilitates the rational design of ultrathin membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Electroreduction Kinetics of Nitrogen to Ammonia via Atomically Dispersed Sn Protuberance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed metal catalysts show potential advantages in N2 reduction reaction (NRR) due to their excellent activity and efficient metal utilization. Unfortunately, the reported catalysts usually exhibit unsatisfactory NRR activity due to their poor N2 adsorption and activation. Herein, we report a novel Sn atomically dispersed protuberance (ADP) by coordination with substrate C and O to induce positive charge accumulation on Sn site for improving its N2 adsorption, activation and NRR performance. The extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra confirmed the local coordination structure of the Sn ADPs. NRR activity was significantly promoted via Sn ADPs, exhibiting a remarkable NH3 yield (RNH3) of 28.3 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mgcat&#8208;1 (7447 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mgSn&#8208;1) at &#8208;0.3 V. Furthermore, the enhanced N2Hx intermediates was verified by in situ experiments, yielding consistent results with DFT calculation. This work opens a new avenue to regulate the activity and selectivity of N2 fixation.</dc:description>

         <title>The rigid core and flexible surface of amyloid fibrils probed by Magic&#8208;Angle Spinning NMR of aromatic residues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic side chains are important reporters of the plasticity of proteins, and often form important contacts in protein&#8208;&#8208;protein interactions. By studying a pair of structurally homologous cross&#8208;&#946; amyloid fibrils, HET&#8208;s and HELLF, with a specific isotope&#8208;labeling approach and magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning (MAS) NMR, we have characterized the dynamic behavior of Phe and Tyr aromatic rings to show that the hydrophobic amyloid core is rigid, without any sign of "breathing motions" over hundreds of milliseconds at least. Aromatic residues exposed at the fibril surface have a rigid ring axis but undergo ring flips, on a variety of time scales from ns to &#181;s. Our approach provides direct insight into hydrophobic&#8208;core motions, enabling a better evaluation of the conformational heterogeneity generated from a NMR structural ensemble of such amyloid cross&#8208;&#946; architecture.</dc:description>

         <title>Organometallic Borromean Rings and [2]Catenanes Featuring Di&#8208; NHC Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvophobic effects have been shown to play a crucial role in the formation and stability of a series of organometallic Borromean rings (BRs) and [2]catenanes prepared from benzobiscarbene complexes. The stability of the interlocked species in solution is related to the lengths of the N&#8208;alkyl substituents at the benzobiscarbene linkers, with longer N&#8208;alkyl substitutes improving the stability of the BRs and enhancing the proportion of [2]catenanes in solution.







Abstract
We report herein a series of organometallic Borromean rings (BRs) and [2]catenanes prepared from benzobiscarbene ligands. The reaction of dinickel complexes of the benzobiscarbenes 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c with a thiazolothiazole bridged bipyridyl ligand L2 led by self&#8208;assembly to a series of organometallic BRs. Solvophobic effects played a crucial role in the formation and stability of the interlocked species. The stability of BRs is related to the N&#8208;alkyl substituents at the precursors 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c, where longer alkyl substitutes improve stability and inter&#8208;ring interactions. Solvophobic effects are also important for the stability of [2]catenanes prepared from 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c and a flexible bipyridyl ligand L3. In solution, an equilibrium between the [2]catenanes and their macrocyclic building blocks was observed. High proportions of [2]catenanes were obtained in concentrated solutions or polar solvents. The proportion of [2]catenanes in solution could be further enhanced by lengthening of the N&#8208;alkyl substitutes.

         <dc:description>Bimetallic electrocatalysts with its superior performance has a broad application prospect in oxygen evolution reaction&#160;(OER), but the fundamental understanding of the mechanism of synergistic effect&#160;is still&#160;limited&#160;since there lacks a practical way to decouple the influence factors on the intrinsic activity of active sites from others. Herein, a series of bimetallic Co&#8208;Ni two&#8208;dimensional polymer (2DP) model OER catalysts with well&#8208;defined architecture, monolayer characteristic, were designed and synthesized to explore the influence of the coupling strength between metal centers on&#160;OER&#160;performance. The coupling strength was regulated by adjusting the spacing between metal centers or the conjugation degree of bridge skeleton. Among the examined 2DPs,&#160;CoTAPP&#8208;Ni&#8208;MF&#8208;2DP, which has the strongest coupling strength between metal centers&#160;exhibited the best OER performance. These model systems can help to explore the precise structure&#8211;performance relationships, which is important for the&#160;rational catalyst design at the atomic/molecular levels.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically recyclable polyethylene&#8208;like sulfur&#8208;containing plastics from sustainable feedstocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The green revolution in plastics should be accelerated due to growing sustainability concerns. Here, we develop a series of chemically recyclable polymers from the first reported cascade polymerization of H2O, COS, and diacrylates. In addition to abundant feedstocks, the method is efficient and air&#8208;tolerant, uses common organic bases as catalysts, and yields polymers with high molecular weights under mild conditions. Such polymers, structurally like polyethylene with low&#8208;density in&#8208;chain polar groups, manifest impressive toughness and ductility comparable to high&#8208;density polyethylene. The in&#8208;chain ester group acts as a breaking point, enabling these polymers to undergo chemical recycling through two loops. The structures and properties of these polymers also have an immeasurably expanded range owing to the versatility of our method. The readily available raw materials, facile synthesis, and high performance make these polymers promising prospects as sustainable materials in practice.</dc:description>

         <title>Enforced Electronic&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex Formation in Water for Photochemical Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The amino alcohol meglumine solubilizes organic compounds in water and enforces the formation of electron donor acceptor (EDA) complexes of haloarenes with indoles, anilines, anisoles or thiols, which are not observed in organic solvents. UV&#8208;A photoinduced electron transfer within the EDA complexes induces the mesolytic cleavage of the halide ion and radical recombination of the arenes leading, after rearomatization and proton loss to C&#8211;C or C&#8211;S coupling products. Depending on the substitution pattern selective and unique cross&#8208;couplings are observed. UV and NMR measurements reveal the importance of the assembly for the photoinduced reaction. Enforced EDA aggregate formation in water allows new activation modes for organic photochemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Electrocatalytic&#160;Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia on MBenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate the great feasibility of MBenes as a new class of tandem catalysts for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR). As a proof of concept,&#160;FeB2&#160;is first employed as a model MBene catalyst for the NO3RR, showing a maximum NH3&#8208;Faradaic efficiency of 96.8% with a corresponding NH3&#160;yield of 25.5 mg h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8208;2&#160;at&#160;&#8208;0.6 V vs. RHE. Mechanistic studies reveal that the exceptional NO3RR activity of FeB2&#160;arises from the tandem catalysis mechanism, that is, B sites activate NO3&#8208;&#160;to form intermediates, while Fe sites dissociate H2O and increase *H&#160;supply on&#160;B sites to promote the intermediate hydrogenation&#160;and enhance the&#160;NO3&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3&#160;conversion.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flipper probes have been introduced as small molecule fluorophores to image physical forces, that is, membrane tension in living systems.&#160; Their emergence over one decade is described, from evolutions in design and synthesis to spectroscopic properties.&#160; Responsiveness to physical compression in equilibrium at the ground state is identified as the ideal origin of mechanosensitivity to image membrane tension in living cells.&#160; A rich collection of flippers is described to deliver and release in any subcellular membrane of interest in a leaflet&#8208;specific manner.&#160; Chalcogen&#8208;bonding cascade switching and dynamic covalent flippers are developed for super&#8208;resolution imaging and dual&#8208;sensing of membrane compression and hydration.&#160; Availability and broad use in the community validate flipper probes as a fine example of the power of translational supramolecular chemistry, moving from fundamental principles to success on the market.</dc:description>

         <title>NH4+ Deprotonation at Interfaces Induced Reversible H3O+/NH4+ Co&#8208;insertion/Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion insertions always involve electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface process, desolvation for instance, which determines the electrochemical kinetics. However, it's still a challenge to achieve fast ion insertion and investigate ion transformation at interface. Herein, the interface deprotonation of NH4+ and the introduced dissociation of H2O molecules to provide sufficient H3O+ to insert into materials' structure for fast energy storages are revealed. Lewis acidic ion&#8211;NH4+ can, on one hand provide H3O+ itself via deprotonation, and on the other hand hydrolyze with H2O molecules to produce H3O+. In situ attenuated total reflection&#8211;Fourier transform infrared ray method probed the interface accumulation and deprotonation of NH4+, and density functional theory calculations manifested that NH4+ tend to thermodynamically adsorb on the surface of monoclinic VO2, and deprotonate to provide H3O+. In addition, the inserted NH4+ have a positive effect for stabilizing the VO2(B) structure. Therefore, high specific capacity (&gt; 300 mAh g&#8722;1) and fast ionic insertion/extraction (&lt; 20 s) can be realized in VO2(B) anode. This interface derivation proposes a new path for designing proton ion insertion/extraction in mild electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Design of Chain&#8208;Growth Click Polymerization Based on a Thiol&#8208;Michael Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of chain&#8208;growth click polymerization is challenging yet desirable in modern polymer chemistry. In this work, we reported a novel chain&#8208;growth click polymerization based on the thiol&#8208;Michael reaction. This polymerization could be performed efficiently under ambient conditions and spatiotemporally regulated by ultraviolet light, allowing the synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers in excellent yields and high molecular weights. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the thiolate addition to the Michael acceptor is the rate&#8208;determining step, and introducing the phenyl group could facilitate the chain&#8208;growth process. This polymerization is a new type of chain&#8208;growth click polymerization, which will provide a unique approach to creating functional polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Preferential Adsorption of Ethylene Oxide on Fe and Chlorine on Ni Enabled Scalable Electrosynthesis of Ethylene Chlorohydrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Industrial manufacturing of ethylene chlorohydrin (ECH) critically requires excess corrosive hydrochloric acid or hypochlorous acid with dealing with massive by&#8208;products and wastes. Here we report a green and efficient electrosynthesis of ECH from ethylene oxide (EO) with NaCl over a NiFe2O4 nanosheet anode. Theoretical results suggest that EO and Cl preferentially adsorbed on Fe and Ni sites, respectively, collaboratively promoting the ECH synthesis. A Cl radical&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening process is proposed and confirmed, and the key Cl and carbon radical species are identified by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. This strategy can enable scalable electrosynthesis of 185.1 mmol of ECH in 1 h with 92.5% yield at a 55 mA cm&#8208;2 current density. Furthermore, a series of other chloro&#8208; and bromoethanols with good to high yields and paired synthesis of ECH and 4&#8208;amino&#8208;3,6&#8208;dichloropyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylicacid via respectively load and unload Cl are achieved, showing the promising potential of this strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasmonic Cu Nanoparticles for the Low&#8208;temperature Photo&#8208;driven Water&#8208;gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of water molecules in thermal catalysis typically requires high temperatures, representing an obstacle to catalyst development for the low&#8208;temperature water&#8208;gas shift reaction (WGSR). Plasmonic photocatalysis allows activation of water at low temperatures through the generation of light&#8208;induced hot electrons. Herein, we report a layered double hydroxide&#8208;derived copper catalyst (LD&#8208;Cu) with outstanding performance for the low&#8208;temperature photo&#8208;driven WGSR. LD&#8208;Cu offered a lower activation energy for WGSR to H2 under UV&#8208;Vis irradiation (1.4 W cm&#8208;2) compared to under dark conditions. Detailed experimental studies revealed that highly dispersed Cu nanoparticles created an abundance of hot electrons during light absorption, which promoted *H2O dissociation and *H combination via a carboxyl pathway, leading to the efficient production of H2. Results demonstrate the benefits of exploiting plasmonic phenomena in the development of photo&#8208;driven low&#8208;temperature WGSR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Dendronized DNA Chimeras Harness Scavenger Receptors To Degrade Cell Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bispecific&#160;chimeras bridging cell membrane proteins with lysosome&#8208;trafficking receptors (LTRs) provide an&#160;effective therapeutic approach through lysosomal degradation of disease&#8208;relevant targets. Here,&#160;we report a&#160;novel&#160;dendronized DNA chimera (DENTAC) strategy&#160;that uses a dendritic DNA to&#160;engage&#160;cell surface scavenger receptors (SRs) as LTR. Using bioorthogonal strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition to conjugate the dendritic DNA with protein binder, the resulting DENTAC is able to&#160;traffic the protein target into the lysosome for elimination. We demonstrated the utility of DENTAC by degrading oncogenic&#160;membrane nucleolin (NCL) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The anti&#8208;cancer application of NCL&#8208;targeting DENTAC was validated in a mouse xenograft model of lung cancer. This work thus presents a new avenue for rapid development of potent degraders against membrane proteins, with also broad research and therapeutic prospects.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidation of the alternating copolymerization mechanism of epoxides or aziridines with cyclic anhydrides in the presence of halide salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic halide salts in combination with metal or Lewis acids are the most common and essential catalysts in ring&#8208;opening copolymerizations (ROCOP). However, the role of organic halide salts was neglected. Here, we have uncovered the complex behavior of organic halide in ROCOP of epoxides or aziridines with cyclic anhydrides. Coordination of the chain&#8208;end cations, electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, leaving ability of halide atoms, chain&#8208;end basicity/nucleophilicity, and terminal steric hindrance cause three types of side reactions: single&#8208;site transesterification, substitution, and elimination. Understanding the complex functions of organic halide salts in ROCOP led us to develop highly active and selective aminocyclopropenium chlorides as catalysts/initiators. Adjustable H&#8208;bonding interactions of aminocyclopropenium with propagating anions and epoxides create chain&#8208;end coordination processes that generate highly reactive carboxylate and highly selective alkoxide chain ends.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopentadiene and Methylcyclopentadiene with Xylose or Extracted Hemicellulose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopentadiene (CPD) and methylcyclopentadiene (MCPD) are important intermediates that have been widely used in the production of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rocket fuels, polymers and valuable chemicals. Currently, CPD and MCPD are produced from fossil energies at very low yields, which greatly limits their application. As a solution to this problem, we disclose an alternative two&#8208;step bio&#8208;route to access CPD and MCPD using xylose or extracted hemicellulose as the feedstock. In the first step, cyclopentanone (CPO) was directly produced by the selective hydrogenolysis of xylose or extracted hemicellulose over a commercial Ru/C catalyst in an acid&#8208;free toluene/NaCl aqueous solution biphasic system. In the second step, CPO was selectively converted to CPD by a cascade hydrodeoxygenation/dehydrogenation reaction over zinc molybdate catalysts. When methanol was introduced with CPO and hydrogen, MCPD was selectively obtained by a cascade dehydrogenation/aldol condensation/selective hydrodeoxygenation reaction over zinc molybdate catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;labeling enzymes (SLE) such as the HaloTag have emerged as powerful tools in high and super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy. Newly developed fluorogenic SLE substrates enable imaging in the presence of excess dye. To exploit this feature for reversible labeling, we engineered two variants of HaloTag7 with restored dehalogenase activity. Kinetic studies in vitro showed different turnover kinetics for reHaloTagS (~0.006&#160;s&#8208;1) and reHaloTagF (~0.055&#160;s&#8208;1). Imaging by confocal and stimulated emission depletion microscopy yielded 3&#8208;time enhanced photostability of reHaloTag labeling. Prominently, single molecule imaging with reHaloTags enabled controlled and stable labeling density over extended time periods. By combination with structured illumination, simultaneous visualization of single molecule diffusion and organellar dynamics was achieved. These applications highlight the potential of reHaloTag labeling for pushing the limits of advanced fluorescence microscopy techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Synthetic Route to High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Oxide Nanoparticles and Their Enhanced Solar Photocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generalization in preparing perovskite oxide nanomaterials with high purity and crystalline quality is crucial to permit their full study and widen their applicative potentials. We provide a generic and robust chemical bath route for synthesizing nano&#8208;shaped rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based REMO3 nanoparticles oxides (RE=La, Nd, Sm, Gd; M=Fe, Mn, Al) by simply changing the desired nitrate salts.







Abstract
The main limitations of current methods for synthesizing perovskite oxide (ABO3) nanoparticles (NPs), e.g., the high reagent costs and sophisticated equipment, the long time and high&#8208;temperature processing, or multiple post&#8208;processing and thermal treatment steps, hamper their full study and potential application. Here, we use a facile low temperature (50&#8201;&#176;C) chemical bath synthesis and only one annealing step to successfully produce high phase purity and crystalline quality nano&#8208;shaped rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based REMO3 NPs (RE=La, Nd, Sm, Gd; M=Fe, Mn, Al).

To assess the potential of the as&#8208;prepared REFeO3 and REMnO3 NPs, they are used for photocatalytic degradation of the norfloxacin antibiotic and show high efficiency.

     alt="A General Synthetic Route to High-Quality Perovskite Oxide Nanoparticles and Their Enhanced Solar Photocatalytic Activity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generalization in preparing perovskite oxide nanomaterials with high purity and crystalline quality is crucial to permit their full study and widen their applicative potentials. We provide a generic and robust chemical bath route for synthesizing nano-shaped rare-earth-based REMO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles oxides (RE=La, Nd, Sm, Gd; M=Fe, Mn, Al) by simply changing the desired nitrate salts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main limitations of current methods for synthesizing perovskite oxide (ABO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoparticles (NPs), e.g., the high reagent costs and sophisticated equipment, the long time and high-temperature processing, or multiple post-processing and thermal treatment steps, hamper their full study and potential application. Here, we use a facile low temperature (50&#8201;&#176;C) chemical bath synthesis and only one annealing step to successfully produce high phase purity and crystalline quality nano-shaped rare-earth-based REMO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NPs (RE=La, Nd, Sm, Gd; M=Fe, Mn, Al). We also show the versatility of this approach by fabricating La&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solid solution and non-RE-based BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite. To assess the potential of the as-prepared REFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and REMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NPs, they are used for photocatalytic degradation of the norfloxacin antibiotic and show high efficiency. We believe this easy, robust, versatile, and general route for synthesizing ABO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based NPs can be further explored in the vast perovskite family and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Stable Solid Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium Metal Battery with Electronically Conductive Fillers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronically conductive materials are generally avoided in electrolyte designs to prevent charge leakage. However, it is found that with small amount of carbon filler, lower overpotential and better cycling stability could be achieved with lithium metal battery. This work proposes a novel perspective of the positive effect of introducing electronically conductive fillers by homogenizing the electric field distribution.







Abstract
Electronic conduction in solid&#8208;polymer electrolytes is generally not desired, which causes leakage of electrons or energy loss, and the electronically conductive domains at electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces can lead to continuous decomposition of electrolytes and shorting issues. However, it is noticed in this work that in an insulating matrix, the conductive domains at certain aspects could also have positive effects on the electrolyte performance with proper control. This work evaluates the limitation and benefits of electronically conductive domains in a solid&#8208;polymer electrolyte system and discusses the approach to improve the electrolyte physicochemical properties with densified local electric field distribution, enhanced bulk dielectric property, and charge transfer. By deliberately introducing the conductive domains in a regular solid&#8208;polymer electrolyte, stable cycle life, low overpotential, and promising full cell performance could be achieved.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes immobilised in hydrogel beads and compartmentalised in a continuous tank reactor were shown to serve as a novel modular and reusable platform for molecular information processing. With small molecules (peptide&#8208;based substrates and inhibitors) as inputs, the robustness of the platform in performing the fundamental arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction and multiplication was demonstrated.







Abstract
Living systems use enzymatic reaction networks to process biochemical information and make decisions in response to external or internal stimuli. Herein, we present a modular and reusable platform for molecular information processing using enzymes immobilised in hydrogel beads and compartmentalised in a continuous stirred tank reactor. We demonstrate how this setup allows us to perform simple arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction and multiplication, using various concentrations of substrates or inhibitors as inputs and the production of a fluorescent molecule as the readout.

         <title>Probing the Nature of Zinc in Copper&#8208;Zinc&#8208;Zirconium Catalysts by Operando Spectroscopies for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Cu&#8722;Zn&#8722;Zr catalysts, interfaces between Cu and atomically dispersed Zn species are established by separating Zn and Zr from Cu in the double nozzles utilized during flame spray pyrolysis (FSP). Operando spectroscopies confirm that the structure is created during CO2 hydrogenation, and it boosts methanol production by suppressing formate decomposition to CO and decreasing the H2 dissociation energy.







Abstract
Active Zn species in Cu&#8208;based methanol synthesis catalysts have not been clearly identified yet due to their complex nature and dynamic structural changes during reactions. Herein, atomically dispersed Zn on ZrO2 support is established in Cu&#8208;based catalysts by separating Zn and Zr components from Cu (Cu&#8722;ZnZr) via the double&#8208;nozzle flame spray pyrolysis (DFSP) method. It exhibits superiority in methanol selectivity and yield compared to those with Cu&#8722;ZnO interface and isolated ZnO nanoparticles. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that the atomically dispersed Zn species are induced during the reaction due to the strengthened Zn&#8722;Zr interaction. They can suppress formate decomposition to CO and decrease the H2 dissociation energy, shifting the reaction to methanol production. This work enlightens the rational design of unique Zn species by regulating coordination environments and offers a new perspective for exploring complex interactions in multi&#8208;component catalysts.

         <dc:description>
Luminescent materials with dual&#8208;mode organic afterglow composed of persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and ultralong organic phosphorescence were developed by doping fluorescein sodium and calcein sodium into aluminum sulfate, respectively. It is found that their afterglow can be excited by ultraviolet and white light, and the persistent luminescence colors can be tuned by varying temperatures and dopant concentrations.







Abstract
Color&#8208;tunable dual&#8208;mode organic afterglow excited by ultraviolet (UV) and white light was achieved from classical aggregation&#8208;caused quenching compounds for the first time. Specifically, two luminescent systems, which could produce significant organic afterglow composed of persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and ultralong organic phosphorescence under ambient conditions, were constructed by doping fluorescein sodium and calcein sodium into aluminum sulfate. Their lifetimes surpassed 600&#8197;ms, and the dopant concentrations were as low as 5&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Moreover, the persistent luminescence colors of the materials could be tuned from blue to green and then to yellow by simply varying the concentrations of guest compounds or the temperature in the range of 260&#8211;340&#8197;K. Inspired by these exciting results, the afterglow materials were used for UV&#8208; and white&#8208;light&#8208;manipulated anti&#8208;counterfeiting and preparation of elastomers with different colors of persistent luminescence.

An atomically dispersed heteronuclear dual&#8208;site catalyst with an axial oxygen atom bridged In&#8208;N6&#8208;Ni moiety anchored on nitrogenated carbon for InNi diatomic sites synergistically accelerating reaction kinetics of electrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts offer a promising pathway for electrochemical CO2 conversion. However, it is still a challenge to optimize the electrochemical performance of dual&#8208;atom catalysts. Here, an atomic indium&#8208;nickel dual&#8208;sites catalyst bridged by an axial oxygen atom (O&#8208;In&#8208;N6&#8208;Ni moiety) was anchored on nitrogenated carbon (InNi DS/NC). InNi DS/NC exhibits superior CO selectivity with Faradaic efficiency higher than 90&#8201;% over a wide potential range from &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;0.8&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). Moreover, an industrial CO partial current density up to 317.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE in a flow cell. In situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS combined with theory calculations reveal that the synergistic effect of In&#8208;Ni dual&#8208;sites and O atom bridge not only reduces the reaction barrier for the formation of *COOH, but also retards the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction. This work provides a feasible strategy to construct dual&#8208;site catalysts towards energy conversion.

         <title>Real&#8208;time Observation of Macroscopic Helical Morphologies under Optical Microscope: A Curious Case of &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Driven Molecular Self&#8208;assembly of an Organic Gelator Devoid of Hydrogen Bonding</title>

         <dc:description>
A DMSO gel of a terpyridine derivative produced macroscopic helical morphologies which could be observed under optical microscope, formation of which could be monitored by optical videography, stable enough to withstand acidic vapour, robust enough to display reversible gel&#8596;sol in response to acidic and ammonia vapour and sturdy enough to be maneuvered with a needle. SXRD and MD simulation suggested &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking behind the self&#8208;assembly process.







Abstract
Supramolecular assemblies such as tubules/helix/double helix/helical tape etc. are usually submicron objects preventing direct observation under optical microscope. Chiral&#8208;pure form of these assemblies is important for potential applications. Herein, we report a rare phenomenon wherein a DMSO gel of a simple terpyridine derivative [(4&#8208;CNPhe)4PyTerp] produced macroscopic helical morphologies (&#956;m length scale) which could be observed under optical microscope, formation of which could be monitored by optical videography, stable enough to withstand acidic vapour, robust enough to display reversible gel&#8596;sol in response to acidic and ammonia vapour and sturdy enough to be maneuvered with a needle. These properties appeared to be unique to the title compound as the other related derivatives failed to display such assembly structures. SXRD and MD simulation studies suggested that weak interactions (&#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking) played a crucial role in the self&#8208;assembly process.

         <title>Superlattice&#8208;based Plasmonic Catalysis: Concentrating Light at the Nanoscale to Drive Efficient Nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Fixation at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organizing anisotropic plasmonic nanoparticles into a two&#8208;dimensional superlattice is important to intensify the electromagnetic field at both the single&#8208;particle and ensemble levels for efficient nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia photoconversion at ambient conditions. Our unique superlattice&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts boost the ammonia formation rate and apparent quantum efficiency by up to &#8776;15&#8208;fold and &#8776;103&#8208;fold, respectively, when compared to traditional photocatalytic and hybrid plasmonic&#8208;photocatalytic designs.







Abstract
Plasmonic catalysis promises green ammonia synthesis but is limited by the need for co&#8208;catalysts and poor performances due to weak electromagnetic field enhancement. Here, we use two&#8208;dimensional plasmonic superlattices with dense electromagnetic hotspots to boost ambient nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia photoconversion without needing co&#8208;catalyst. By organizing Ag octahedra into a square superlattice to concentrate light, the ammonia formation is enhanced by &#8776;15&#8208;fold and 4&#8208;fold over hexagonal superlattice and disorganized array, respectively. Our unique catalyst achieves superior ammonia formation rate and apparent quantum yield up to &#8776;15&#8208;fold and &#8776;103&#8208;fold, respectively, better than traditional designs. Mechanistic investigations reveal the abundance of intense plasmonic hotspots is crucial to promote hot electron generation and transfer for nitrogen reduction. Our work offers valuable insights to design electromagnetically hot plasmonic catalysts for diverse chemical and energy applications.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time In Situ Volatile Organic Compound Sensing by a Dual&#8208;Emissive Polynuclear Ln&#8208;MOF with Pronounced LnIII Luminescence Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;emissive polynuclear Eu&#8208;MOF enriched with abundant potential open metal sites was constructed. In terms of a novel recognition&#8208;transduction protocol, this material realized real&#8208;time in situ visual detection of THF vapor (&lt;1&#8197;s) while showing a quantitative ratiometric response to vapor pressure with an ultralow limit of detection.







Abstract
Lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) are promising for luminescence detection of volatile organic compound (VOC) vapors, but usually suffer from the silent or quenched Ln3+ emission. Herein, we report a new dual&#8208;emissive Eu&#8208;MOF composed of the coordinatively unsaturated Eu9 clusters that afford abundant open metal sites to form a confined &#8220;binding pocket&#8221; to facilitate the preconcentration and recognition of VOCs. Single&#8208;crystal structural analyses reveal that specific analytes can replace the OH oscillators in the first coordination sphere of Eu3+ and form a unique hydrogen&#8208;bonding second&#8208;sphere adduct tying adjacent Eu9 clusters together to minimize their nonradiative vibrational decay. With the promoted Eu3+ luminescence, the MOF realizes real&#8208;time in situ visual sensing of THF vapor (&lt;1&#8197;s) and shows a quantitative ratiometric response to the vapor pressure with a limit of detection down to 17.33&#8197;Pa. Also, it represents a top&#8208;performing ratiometric luminescent thermometer.

         <title>Stiffness&#8208;Transformable Nanoplatforms Responsive to the Tumor Microenvironment for Enhanced Tumor Therapeutic Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stiffness&#8208;transformable nanoplatforms in response to a simulated tumor microenvironment (TME) were designed. The nanoplatforms maintain quasi&#8208;spherical shape in normal physiological conditions, which effectively reduces macrophage uptake and nonspecific liver/spleen distributions, and transform to soft nanocapsules in a TME, thus enhancing tumor penetration, cellular uptake and tumor accumulation.







Abstract
Herein, we report, for the first time, a unique stiffness&#8208;transformable manganese oxide hybridized mesoporous organosilica nanoplatform (MMON) for enhancing tumor therapeutic efficacy. The prepared MMONs had a quasi&#8208;spherical morphology and were completely transformed into soft bowl&#8208;like nanocapsules in the simulated tumor microenvironment through the breakage of Mn&#8722;O bonds, which decreased their Young's modulus from 165.7 to 84.5&#8197;MPa. Due to their unique stiffness transformation properties, the MMONs had reduced macrophage internalization, improved tumor cell uptake, and enhanced penetration of multicellular spheroids. In addition, in vivo experiments showed that the MMONs displayed a 3.79&#8208; and 2.90&#8208;fold decrease in non&#8208;specific liver distribution and a 2.87&#8208; and 1.83&#8208;fold increase in tumor accumulation compared to their soft and stiff counterparts, respectively. Furthermore, chlorin e6 (Ce6) modified MMONs had significantly improved photodynamic therapeutic effect.

         <title>A Versatile Strategy for Screening Custom&#8208;Designed Warhead&#8208;Armed Cyclic Peptide Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a general strategy for a yeast&#8208;based screening platform that we call custom&#8208;designed warhead&#8208;armed cyclic peptide screening (or CWCPS). This platform has led to the discovery of a potent inhibitor CY5&#8208;6Q that targets human histone deacetylase 8 with a KD value in the double&#8208;digit nanomolar range. This strategy can be a versatile platform for peptide&#8208;based drug discovery.







Abstract
Demand for peptide&#8208;based pharmaceuticals has been steadily increasing, but only limited success has been achieved to date. To expedite peptide&#8208;based drug discovery, we developed a general scheme for cell&#8208;based screening of cyclic peptide inhibitors armed with a user&#8208;designed warhead. We combined unnatural amino acid incorporation and split intein&#8208;mediated peptide cyclization techniques and integrated a yeast&#8208;based colorimetric screening assay to generate a new scheme that we call the custom&#8208;designed warhead&#8208;armed cyclic peptide screening platform (CWCPS). This strategy successfully discovered a potent inhibitor, CY5&#8208;6Q, that targets human histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) with a KD value of 15&#8197;nM. This approach can be a versatile and general platform for discovering cyclic peptide inhibitors.

         <title>Quantitative Single&#8208;Molecule Electrochemiluminescence Bioassay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence bioassay which allows imaging of single biomolecules with nanometer resolution based on localizing the repeated electrochemiluminescence reactions. Quantification of biomolecules is achieved by merging the clustered reactions at one molecule site and then counting the merged molecule numbers.







Abstract
A single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence bioassay is developed here which allows imaging and direct quantification of single biomolecules. Imaging single biomolecules is realized by localizing the electrochemiluminescence events of the labeled molecules. Such an imaging system allows mapping the spatial distribution of biomolecules with electrochemiluminescence and contains quantitative single&#8208;molecule insights. We further quantify biomolecules by spatiotemporally merging the repeated reactions at one molecule site and then counting the clustered molecules. The proposed single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence bioassay is used to detect carcinoembryonic antigen, showing a limit of detection of 67 attomole concentration which is 10&#8201;000 times better than conventional electrochemiluminescence bioassays. This spatial resolution and sensitivity enable single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence bioassay a new toolbox for both specific bioimaging and ultrasensitive quantitative analysis.

         <title>Giant Polyoxoniobate&#8208;Based Inorganic Molecular Tweezers: Metal Recognitions, Ion&#8208;Exchange Interactions and Mechanism Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The twelve {Nb6} units on the surface of a giant polyoxoniobate cluster can function as six pairs of polyoxoniobate&#8208;based inorganic molecular tweezers with unique C2v&#8208;symmetry binding cavities. They exhibit selective metal&#8208;uptake behaviours.







Abstract
This work reports the interesting and unique cation&#8208;exchange behaviors of the first indium&#8208;bridged purely inorganic 3D framework based on high&#8208;nuclearity polyoxoniobates as building units. Each nanoscale polyoxoniobate features a fascinating near&#8208;icosahedral core&#8211;shell structure with six pairs of unique inorganic &#8220;molecular tweezers&#8221; that have changeable openings for binding different metal cations via ion&#8208;exchanges and exhibit unusual selective metal&#8208;uptake behaviors. Further, the material has high chemical stability so that can undergo single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal metal&#8208;exchange processes to produce a dozen new crystals with high crystallinity. Based on these crystals and time&#8208;dependent metal&#8208;exchange experiments, we can visually reveal the detailed metal&#8208;exchange interactions and mechanisms of the material at the atomic precision level. This work demonstrates a rare systematic and atomic&#8208;level study on the ion&#8208;exchange properties of nanoclusters, which is of significance for the exploration of cluster&#8208;based ion&#8208;exchange materials that are still to be developed.

         <title>Organoboron Reagent&#8208;Controlled Selective (Deutero)Hydrodefluorination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein reported an electrochemical selective (deutero)hydrodefluorination reaction of trifluoroacetamides. The reaction which exhibits a remarkable chemoselectivity control and delivers (deuterium&#8208;labeled) CF2H&#8208; and CFH2&#8208;products in good yields with high level of deuterium incorporation, respectively, is enabled by the addition of different organoboron sources and (deuterated)water as the deuterium or hydrogen source.







Abstract
(Deuterium&#8208;labeled) CF2H&#8208; and CFH2&#8208;moieties are of high interest in drug discovery. The high demand for the incorporation of these fluoroalkyl moieties into molecular structures has witnessed significant synthetic progress, particularly in the (deutero)hydrodefluorination of CF3&#8208;containing compounds. However, the controllable replacement of fluorine atoms while maintaining high chemoselectivity remains challenging. Herein, we describe the development of a selective (deutero)hydrodefluorination reaction via electrolysis. The reaction exhibits a remarkable chemoselectivity control, which is enabled by the addition of different organoboron sources. The procedure is operationally simple and scalable, and provides access in one step to high&#8208;value building blocks for application in medicinal chemistry. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out to investigate the reaction mechanism and to rationalize the chemoselectivity observed.

         <title>Ranking Peptide Binders by Affinity with AlphaFold
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
AlphaFold is transforming the field of protein structure prediction. Standing on its highly accurate mapping between protein sequence and structure, we discovered a novel way to predict the ranking of peptide binding affinities through a competitive binding assay. While there are still limitations, we anticipate this approach can be easily adopted for identifying higher affinity peptide binders.







Abstract
AlphaFold has revolutionized structural biology by predicting highly accurate structures of proteins and their complexes with peptides and other proteins. However, for protein&#8208;peptide systems, we are also interested in identifying the highest affinity binder among a set of candidate peptides. We present a novel competitive binding assay using AlphaFold to predict structures of the receptor in the presence of two peptides. For systems in which the individual structures of the peptides are well predicted, the assay captures the higher affinity binder in the bound state, and the other peptide in the unbound form with statistical significance. We test the application on six protein receptors for which we have experimental binding affinities to several peptides. We find that the assay is best suited for identifying medium to strong peptide binders that adopt stable secondary structures upon binding.

         <title>Gradient Graphdiyne Induced Copper and Oxygen Vacancies in Cu0.95V2O5 Anodes for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Cu0.95V2O5 self&#8208;catalyzes the growth of gradient GDY to generate Cu and O vacancies in Cu0.95V2O5@GDY heterostructure material. The rich Cu/O vacancies, outside&#8208;in self&#8208;expanded ion&#8208;transport channels enabled by gradient GDY, and synergistic effect of built&#8208;in electric field greatly enhance the Li&#8208;ion transport kinetics, the electrochemical reaction reversibility and the Li storage sites of Cu0.95V2O5, thus boosting its fast&#8208;charging performance.







Abstract
Vacancies can significantly affect the performance of metal oxide materials. Here, a gradient graphdiyne (GDY) induced Cu/O&#8208;dual&#8208;vacancies abundant Cu0.95V2O5@GDY heterostructure material has been prepared as a competitive fast&#8208;charging anode material. Cu0.95V2O5 self&#8208;catalyzes the growth of gradient GDY with rich alkyne&#8208;alkene complex in the inner layer and rich alkyne bonds in the outer layer, leading to the formation of Cu and O vacancies in Cu0.95V2O5. The synergistic effect of vacancies and gradient GDY results in the electron redistribution at the hetero&#8208;interface to drive the generation of a built&#8208;in electric field. Thus, the Li&#8208;ion transport kinetics, electrochemical reaction reversibility and Li storage sites of Cu0.95V2O5 are greatly enhanced. The Cu0.95V2O5@GDY anodes show excellent fast&#8208;charging performance with high capacities and negligible capacity decay for 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles and 20&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at extremely high current densities of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively. Over 30&#8201;% of capacity can be delivered in 35&#8197;seconds.

         <title>Non&#8208;Kinetic Effects Convolute Activity and Tafel Analysis for the Alkaline Oxygen Evolution Reaction on NiFeOOH Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied NiFeOOH catalysts for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with different loading, varying rotation rate, hydroxide concentration and with and without sonication. We show that the Tafel slope initially is &#8776;30&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 for NiFeOOH in 0.05&#8211;0.2&#8197;M KOH, and at higher polarization the Tafel slope continually increases due to bubbles, potential&#8208;dependent changes in ohmic resistance, and (internal) OH&#8722; gradients.







Abstract
A large variety of nickel&#8208;based catalysts has been investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. However, their reported activity, as well as Tafel slope values, vary greatly. To understand this variation, we studied electrodeposited Ni80Fe20OOH catalysts with different loadings at varying rotation rates, hydroxide concentrations, with or without sonication. We show that, at low current density (&lt;5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), the Tafel slope value is &#8776;30&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 for Ni80Fe20OOH. At higher polarization, the Tafel slope continuously increases and is dependent on rotation rate, loading, hydroxide concentration and sonication. These Tafel slope values are convoluted by non&#8208;kinetic effects, such as bubbles, potential&#8208;dependent changes in ohmic resistance and (internal) OH&#8722; gradients. As best practise, we suggest that Tafel slopes should be plotted vs. current or potential. In such a plot, it can be appreciated if there is a kinetic Tafel slope or if the observed Tafel slope is influenced by non&#8208;kinetic effects.

         <title>Wacker Oxidation of Methylenecyclobutanes: Scope and Selectivity in an Unusual Setting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylenecyclobutanes undergo Wacker oxidation towards cyclopentanones under mild reaction conditions. A semi&#8208;pinacol&#8208;type rearrangement is proposed to be responsible for the intermediary 1,2&#8208;shift, which not only explains the formation of the products, but also rationalizes the reaction outcomes in terms of site&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Methylenecyclobutanes are found to undergo Wacker oxidation via a semi&#8208;pinacol&#8208;type rearrangement. Key to a successful process is the use of tert&#8208;butyl nitrite as oxidant, which not only enables efficient catalyst turn&#8208;over but also ensures high Markovnikov&#8208;selectivity under mild conditions. Thus, cyclopentanones (26 examples) can be accessed in an overall good yield and excellent selectivity (up to 97&#8201;% yield, generally &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 ketone:aldehyde ratio). Stereochemical analysis of the reaction sequence reveals migration aptitudes in line with related 1,2&#8208;shifts. By introducing a pyox ligand to palladium, prochiral methylenecyclobutanes can be desymmetrized, thus realizing the first enantioselective Wacker oxidation.

         <title>Switchable and Highly Robust Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Polymer&#8208;Based Transparent Films with Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Networks for Erasable Light Printing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of efficient phosphorescence materials were developed by embedding phenothiazine, phenoxazine, and 10&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine into epoxy polymers. It is found that the polymer film involving phenoxazine shows reversible photochromism, switchable ultralong organic phosphorescence, and prominent water and chemical resistance simultaneously. In addition, its potential application in erasable light printing has also been demonstrated.







Abstract
In this work, an efficient polymer&#8208;based organic afterglow system, which shows reversible photochromism, switchable ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP), and prominent water and chemical resistance simultaneously, has been developed for the first time. By doping phenoxazine (PXZ) and 10&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine (PXZEt) into epoxy polymers, the resulting PXZ@EP&#8208;0.25&#8201;% and PXZEt@EP&#8208;0.25&#8201;% films show unique photoactivated UOP properties, with phosphorescence quantum yields and lifetimes up to 10.8&#8201;% and 845&#8197;ms, respectively. It is found that the steady&#8208;state luminescence and UOP of PXZ@EP&#8208;0.25&#8201;% are switchable by light irradiation and thermal annealing. Moreover, the doped films can still produce conspicuous UOP after soaking in water, strong acid and base, and organic solvents for more than two weeks, exhibiting outstanding water and chemical resistance. Inspired by these exciting results, the PXZ@EP&#8208;0.25&#8201;% has been successfully exploited as an erasable transparent film for light printing.

An universal strategy was proposed to develop red multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters by introducing auxiliary donor and acceptor moieties into the HOMO and LUMO distributed positions of B,N&#8208;containing multiple resonance skeleton simultaneously. The solution&#8208;processable pure&#8208;red OLED exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with external quantum efficiency over 20&#8201;%, high color purity and good operational lifetime.







Abstract
Developing solution&#8208;processable red organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity and efficiency based on multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) is a formidable challenge. Herein, by introducing auxiliary electron donor and acceptor moieties into the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) distributed positions of multiple resonance skeleton simultaneously, an effective strategy to obtain red MR&#8208;TADF emitters was represented. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept molecule BN&#8208;R exhibits a narrowband pure&#8208;red emission at 624&#8197;nm, with a high luminous efficiency of 94&#8201;% and a narrow bandwidth of 46&#8197;nm. Notably, the fabricated solution&#8208;processable pure&#8208;red OLED based on BN&#8208;R exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art external quantum efficiency over 20&#8201;% with the Commission Internationale de I&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.663, 0.337) and a long operational lifetime (LT50) of 1088&#8197;hours at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Controllable Single and Double Difluoromethylene Formal Insertions into C&#8722;H Bonds of Aldehydes with TMSCF2Br</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented controllable single and double difluoromethylene (CF2) formal insertions into C&#8722;H bonds of aldehydes under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions with nearly full selectivity has been achieved, in which the well&#8208;defined formation of 2,2&#8208;difluoroenolsilyl ether and 2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluorocyclopropanolsilyl ether intermediates using difluorocarbene reagent TMSCF2Br (TMS=trimethylsilyl) is the key to the success.







Abstract
We have developed a new strategy for controllable single and double difluoromethylene (CF2) formal insertions into C&#8722;H bonds of aldehydes with nearly full selectivity under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. The key to the success of controllable CF2 insertions lies in the well&#8208;defined formation of 2,2&#8208;difluoroenolsilyl ether and 2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluorocyclopropanolsilyl ether intermediates using difluorocarbene reagent TMSCF2Br (TMS=trimethylsilyl). These two intermediates can react with various electrophiles including proton sources and various halogenation reagents, allowing for the access to diverse arrays of ketones containing difluoromethylene (CF2) and tetrafluoroethylene (CF2CF2) units. The first synthesis of relatively stable 2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluorocyclopropanolsilyl ethers has been achieved, which offers a new platform to explore other unknown chemical space.

         <title>An Activatable NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Reporter for In Vivo Imaging of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Plaques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;II fluorescent reporter (i.e., DMP2) is designed to specifically activate its NIR&#8208;II fluorescence upon binding to amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) fibrils via a suppressed twisted intramolecular charge transfer effect. Benefiting from high specificity in response to A&#946; fibrils and suitable lipophilicity to penetrate BBB, DMP2 achieves in vivo visualization of A&#946; plaques in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.







Abstract
Fluorescence imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window holds great promise for in vivo visualization of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) pathology, which can facilitate characterization and deep understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, it has been rarely exploited. Herein, we report the development of NIR&#8208;II fluorescent reporters with a donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) architecture for specific detection of A&#946; plaques in AD&#8208;model mice. Among all the designed probes, DMP2 exhibits the highest affinity to A&#946; fibrils and can specifically activate its NIR&#8208;II fluorescence after binding to A&#946; fibrils via suppressed twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) effect. With suitable lipophilicity for ideal blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) penetrability and deep&#8208;tissue penetration of NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, DMP2 possesses specific detection of A&#946; plaques in in vivo AD&#8208;model mice. Thus, this study presents a potential agent for non&#8208;invasive imaging of A&#946; plaques and deep deciphering of AD progression.

         <title>Amyloid Against Amyloid: Dimeric Amyloid Fragment Ameliorates Cognitive Impairments by Direct Clearance of Oligomers and Plaques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the N&#8208;terminal of amyloid&#8208;&#946;, we designed a dimeric A&#946; (1&#8211;17)&#8208;based peptide drug that crosses the blood&#8211;brain barrier and dissociates amyloid plaques and oligomers upon administration to transgenic Alzheimer model mice.







Abstract
Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) in the form of neurotoxic aggregates is regarded as the main pathological initiator and key therapeutic target of Alzheimer's disease. However, anti&#8208;A&#946; drug development has been impeded by the lack of a target needed for structure&#8208;based drug design and low permeability of the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB). An attractive therapeutic strategy is the development of amyloid&#8208;based anti&#8208;A&#946; peptidomimetics that exploit the self&#8208;assembling nature of A&#946; and penetrate the BBB. Herein, we designed a dimeric peptide drug candidate based on the N&#8208;terminal fragment of A&#946;, DAB, found to cross the BBB and solubilize A&#946; oligomers and fibrils. Administration of DAB reduced amyloid burden in 5XFAD mice, and downregulated neuroinflammation and prevented memory impairment in the Y&#8208;maze test. Peptide mapping assays and molecular docking studies were utilized to elucidate DAB&#8208;A&#946; interaction. To further understand the active regions of DAB, we assessed the dissociative activity of DAB with sequence modifications.

         <title>Constructing Mechanical Shuttles in a Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Porous Architecture for Selective Transport of Lithium Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crown ether mechanically interlocked three&#8208;dimensional porous architecture is prepared as the porous filler of mixed&#8208;matrix membranes. The mechanical shuttles speed up the ion transport in the adsorbent solid, leading to a rapid and selective transport of lithium ions.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) extraction from brines is a major barrier to the sustainable development of batteries and alloys; however, current separation technology suffers from a trade&#8208;off between ion selectivity and permeability. Herein, a crown ether mechanically interlocked 3D porous organic framework (Crown&#8208;POF) was prepared as the porous filler of thin&#8208;film nanocomposite membranes. Crown&#8208;POF with penta&#8208;coordinated (four Ocrown atoms and one Ntert&#8208;amine atom) adsorption sites enables a special recognition for Li+ ion. Moreover, the four Ntert&#8208;amine atoms on each POF branch facilitate the flipping motion of Li+ ion along the skeletal thread, while retaining the specified binding pattern. Accordingly, the crown ether interlocked POF network displays an ultrafast ion transfer rate, over 10&#8197;times that of the conventional porous materials. Notably, the nanocomposite membrane gives high speed and selectivity for Li+ ion transport as compared with other porous solid&#8208;based mixed&#8208;matrix membranes.

     alt="Constructing Mechanical Shuttles in a Three-dimensional (3D) Porous Architecture for Selective Transport of Lithium Ions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crown ether mechanically interlocked three-dimensional porous architecture is prepared as the porous filler of mixed-matrix membranes. The mechanical shuttles speed up the ion transport in the adsorbent solid, leading to a rapid and selective transport of lithium ions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium (Li) extraction from brines is a major barrier to the sustainable development of batteries and alloys; however, current separation technology suffers from a trade-off between ion selectivity and permeability. Herein, a crown ether mechanically interlocked 3D porous organic framework (Crown-POF) was prepared as the porous filler of thin-film nanocomposite membranes. Crown-POF with penta-coordinated (four O&lt;sub&gt;crown&lt;/sub&gt; atoms and one N&lt;sub&gt;tert-amine&lt;/sub&gt; atom) adsorption sites enables a special recognition for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion. Moreover, the four N&lt;sub&gt;tert-amine&lt;/sub&gt; atoms on each POF branch facilitate the flipping motion of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion along the skeletal thread, while retaining the specified binding pattern. Accordingly, the crown ether interlocked POF network displays an ultrafast ion transfer rate, over 10&#8197;times that of the conventional porous materials. Notably, the nanocomposite membrane gives high speed and selectivity for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion transport as compared with other porous solid-based mixed-matrix membranes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneous Harvesting of Multiple Hot Holes via Visible&#8208;Light Excitation of Plasmonic Gold Nanospheres for Selective Oxidative Bond Scission of Olefins to Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harvesting of multiple hot holes has been demonstrated using Au nanospheres for the plasmonic photocatalytic oxidative scission of olefin to carbonyls through a step&#8208;down process. Interband photoexcitation of Au nanospheres beyond a threshold intensity leads to a spurt in hot&#8208;carrier generation, enabling multifold enhancement in substrate activation compared to a dark process.







Abstract
Using visible photoexcitation of gold nanospheres we successfully demonstrate the simultaneous harvesting of plasmon&#8208;induced multiple hot holes in the complete oxidative scission of the C=C bond in styrene at room temperature to selectively form benzaldehyde and formaldehyde, which is a reaction that requires activation of multiple substrates. Our results reveal that, while extraction of hot holes becomes efficient for interband excitation, harvesting of multiple hot holes from the excited Au nanospheres becomes prevalent only beyond a threshold light intensity. We show that the alkene oxidation proceeded via a sequence of two consecutive elementary steps; namely, a binding step and a cyclic oxometallate transition state as the rate&#8208;determining step. This demonstration of plasmon&#8208;excitation&#8208;mediated harvesting of multiple hot holes without the use of an extra hole transport media opens exciting possibilities, notably for difficult catalytic transformations involving multielectron oxidation processes.

         <title>A Melt&#8208;Quenched Luminescent Glass of an Organic&#8211;Inorganic Manganese Halide as a Large&#8208;Area Scintillator for Radiation Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel zero&#8208;dimensional manganese&#8208;based metal halide capable of forming a stable melt is reported. Large&#8208;area luminescent metal halide glasses can be conveniently synthesized by the melt&#8208;quenching method and used as scintillators for radiation detection.







Abstract
Glass is a group of materials with appealing qualities, including simplicity in fabrication, durability, and high transparency, and they play a crucial role in the optics field. In this paper, a new organic&#8211;inorganic metal halide luminescent glass exhibiting &gt;78&#8201;% transmittance at 506&#8211;800&#8197;nm range together with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 28.5&#8201;% is reported through a low&#8208;temperature melt&#8208;quenching approach of pre&#8208;synthesized (HTPP)2MnBr4 (HTPP=hexyltriphenylphosphonium) single crystal. Temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray diffraction, polarizing microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations were combined to investigate the glass&#8208;crystal interconversion process, revealing the disordered nature of the glassy state. Benefiting from the transparent nature, (HTPP)2MnBr4 glass yields an outstanding spatial resolution of 10&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1 for X&#8208;ray imaging. The superb optical properties and facility of large&#8208;scale fabrication distinguish the organic&#8211;inorganic metal halide glass as a highly promising class of materials for optical devices.

         <title>Boosting Charge Transport in a 2D/3D Perovskite Heterostructure by Selecting an Ordered 2D Perovskite as the Passivator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural ordering of 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite results in the structural ordering of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure and further boosts the excellent optoelectronic properties of the heterostructure films.







Abstract
We demonstrate that an ordered 2D perovskite can significantly boost the photoelectric performance of 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures. Using selective fluorination of phenyl&#8208;ethyl ammonium (PEA) lead iodide to passivate 3D FA0.8Cs0.2PbI3, we find that the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures passivated by a higher ordered 2D perovskite have lower Urbach energy, yielding a remarkable increase in photoluminescence (PL) intensity, PL lifetime, charge&#8208;carrier mobilities (&#981;&#956;), and carrier diffusion length (LD) for a certain 2D perovskite content. High performance with an ultralong PL lifetime of &#8776;1.3&#8197;&#956;s, high &#981;&#956; of &#8776;18.56&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and long LD of &#8776;7.85&#8197;&#956;m is achieved in the 2D/3D films when passivated by 16.67&#8201;% para&#8208;fluoro&#8208;PEA2PbI4. This carrier diffusion length is comparable to that of some perovskite single crystals (&gt;5&#8197;&#956;m). These findings provide key missing information on how the organic cations of 2D perovskites influence the performance of 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures.

         <title>Neutralizing the Impact of the Virulence Factor LecA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa on Human Cells with New Glycomimetic Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inhibition of the bacterial lectin LecA is an alternative option to treat infections with the ESKAPE pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Optimization of divalent LecA ligands yielded ligands with good drug&#8208;like properties and high potency. Compound evaluation in functional cellular assays showed their ability to inhibit LecA&#8208;mediated virulence, demonstrating their suitability as pathoblockers.







Abstract
Bacterial adhesion, biofilm formation and host cell invasion of the ESKAPE pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa require the tetravalent lectins LecA and LecB, which are therefore drug targets to fight these infections. Recently, we have reported highly potent divalent galactosides as specific LecA inhibitors. However, they suffered from very low solubility and an intrinsic chemical instability due to two acylhydrazone motifs, which precluded further biological evaluation. Here, we isosterically substituted the acylhydrazones and systematically varied linker identity and length between the two galactosides necessary for LecA binding. The optimized divalent LecA ligands showed improved stability and were up to 1000&#8208;fold more soluble. Importantly, these properties now enabled their biological characterization. The lead compound L2 potently inhibited LecA binding to lung epithelial cells, restored wound closure in a scratch assay and reduced the invasiveness of P. aeruginosa into host cells.

The Outer Membrane Protein&#8197;G (OmpG) nanopore has been demonstrated as a highly selective platform for protein sensing. By simultaneously functionalizing two of the porin's seven loops with peptide motifs we achieve single&#8208;molecule multiplex protein detection.







Abstract
Molecular detection via nanopore, achieved by monitoring changes in ionic current arising from analyte interaction with the sensor pore, is a promising technology for multiplex sensing development. Outer Membrane Protein&#8197;G (OmpG), a monomeric porin possessing seven functionalizable loops, has been reported as an effective sensing platform for selective protein detection. Using flow cytometry to screen unfavorable constructs, we identified two OmpG nanopores with unique peptide motifs displayed in either loop 3 or 6, which also exhibited distinct analyte signals in single&#8208;channel current recordings. We exploited these motif&#8208;displaying loops concurrently to facilitate single&#8208;molecule multiplex protein detection in a mixture. We additionally report a strategy to increase sensor sensitivity via avidity motif display. These sensing schemes may be expanded to more sophisticated designs utilizing additional loops to increase multiplicity and sensitivity.

         <title>Decreased Water Mobility Contributes To Increased &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ions can influence the mobility of water molecules in the solvation shell of a protein, which is important for folding and function. We show ions that decrease water mobility contribute to decreased protein mobility and subsequently to an increase in the self&#8208;association and aggregation rate. Alteration in water mobility may occur in ageing cells where ion concentrations become dysregulated and therefore promote &#945;Syn aggregation.







Abstract
The solvation shell is essential for the folding and function of proteins, but how it contributes to protein misfolding and aggregation has still to be elucidated. We show that the mobility of solvation shell H2O molecules influences the aggregation rate of the amyloid protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;Syn), a protein associated with Parkinson's disease. When the mobility of H2O within the solvation shell is reduced by the presence of NaCl, &#945;Syn aggregation rate increases. Conversely, in the presence CsI the mobility of the solvation shell is increased and &#945;Syn aggregation is reduced. Changing the solvent from H2O to D2O leads to increased aggregation rates, indicating a solvent driven effect. We show the increased aggregation rate is not directly due to a change in the structural conformations of &#945;Syn, it is also influenced by a reduction in both the H2O mobility and &#945;Syn mobility. We propose that reduced mobility of &#945;Syn contributes to increased aggregation by promoting intermolecular interactions.

         <title>Electronic Control of the Scholl Reaction: Selective Synthesis of Spiro vs Helical Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic nature of the starting substrate decides the fate of the reaction: Anthracene&#8208;based polyphenylenes lead to less&#8208;known spiro (R=H) or helical (R=F) nanographenes under mild Scholl conditions, depending upon the substitution pattern on the anthracene core. DFT calculations reveal that the formation, or not, of the trityl cation is the key issue.







Abstract
Scholl oxidation has become an essential reaction in the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of molecular nanographenes. Herein, we describe a Scholl reaction controlled by the electronic effects on the starting substrate (1&#8201;a,&#8201;b). Anthracene&#8208;based polyphenylenes lead to spironanographenes under Scholl conditions. In contrast, an electron&#8208;deficient anthracene substrate affords a helically arranged molecular nanographene formed by two orthogonal dibenzo[fg,ij]phenanthro&#8208;[9,10,1,2,3&#8208;pqrst]pentaphene (DBPP) moieties linked through an octafluoroanthracene core. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations predict that electronic effects control either the first formation of spirocycles and subsequent Scholl reaction to form spironanographene 2, or the expected dehydrogenation reaction leading solely to the helical nanographene 3. The crystal structures of four of the new spiro compounds (syn 2, syn 9, anti 9 and syn 10) were solved by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The photophysical properties of the new molecular nanographene 3 reveal a remarkable dual fluorescent emission.

The first study of the coordination behavior of tetrahedrane Sb&#8208;donor complexes towards AgI salts afforded twelve unprecedented supramolecular aggregates as monomers, dimers as well as three&#8208; and four&#8208;membered chains of AgI. Pathways for the assembling processes were suggested based on manifold solution studies and the presence of argentophilic interactions in compounds containing two or more AgI ions was confirmed by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Synthesis and reactivity of transition metal compounds bearing &#8220;naked&#8221; pnictogen atoms is an active research area with remarkable bonding patterns observed in the formed compounds. Within this field, intense investigations on the coordination behavior of complexes possessing Pn and Asn (2&#8804;n&#8804;5) moieties have been conducted. However, studies on heavier analogues have been ignored so far due to arduous challenges related to low yields and moderate air stability. Herein, we present the first in&#8208;depth study addressing the reactivity of organometallic complexes containing Sb&#8208;donor atoms with several AgI salts. These reactions afforded twelve unprecedented aggregates as monomers, dimers as well as three&#8208; and four&#8208;membered chains of AgI ions claimed in the literature to be inaccessible. Interatomic distances as well as computational evidence obtained with help of several different methods suggest the presence of Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag interactions in all complexes containing more than one AgI ion.

         <title>A Highly Stable, Capacity Dense Carboxylate Viologen Anolyte towards Long&#8208;Duration Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>

A carboxylate functionalized viologen is developed as a capacity dense, highly stable anolyte for aqueous organic redox flow batteries up to 50&#8197;days of stable cycling.







Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) have received increasing attention as an emergent battery technology for grid&#8208;scale renewable energy storage. However, physicochemical properties of redox&#8208;active organic electrolytes remain fine refinement to maximize their performance in RFBs. Herein, we report a carboxylate functionalized viologen derivative, N,N&#8242;&#8208;dibutyrate&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium, (CBu)2V, as a highly stable, high capacity anolyte material under near pH neutral conditions. (CBu)2V can achieve solubility of 2.1&#8197;M and display a reversible, kinetically fast reduction at &#8722;0.43&#8197;V vs NHE at pH&#8197;9. DFT studies revealed that the high solubility of (CBu)2V is attributed to its high molecular polarity while its negative reduction potential is benefitted from electron&#8208;donating carboxylate groups. A 0.89&#8197;V (CBu)2V/(NH)4Fe(CN)6 AORFB demonstrated exceptional energy storage performance, specifically, 100&#8201;% capacity retention with a discharge energy density of 9.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 for 1000 cycles, power densities of up to 85&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and an energy efficiency of 70&#8201;% at 60&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. (CBu)2V not only represents the most capacity dense viologen with pendant ionic groups and also exhibits the longest (1200&#8197;hours or 50&#8197;days) and the most stable flow battery performance to date.

     alt="A Highly Stable, Capacity Dense Carboxylate Viologen Anolyte towards Long-Duration Energy Storage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A carboxylate functionalized viologen is developed as a capacity dense, highly stable anolyte for aqueous organic redox flow batteries up to 50&#8197;days of stable cycling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) have received increasing attention as an emergent battery technology for grid-scale renewable energy storage. However, physicochemical properties of redox-active organic electrolytes remain fine refinement to maximize their performance in RFBs. Herein, we report a carboxylate functionalized viologen derivative, N,N&#8242;-dibutyrate-4,4&#8242;-bipyridinium, &lt;b&gt;(CBu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;/b&gt;, as a highly stable, high capacity anolyte material under near pH neutral conditions. &lt;b&gt;(CBu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;/b&gt; can achieve solubility of 2.1&#8197;M and display a reversible, kinetically fast reduction at &#8722;0.43&#8197;V vs NHE at pH&#8197;9. DFT studies revealed that the high solubility of &lt;b&gt;(CBu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;/b&gt; is attributed to its high molecular polarity while its negative reduction potential is benefitted from electron-donating carboxylate groups. A 0.89&#8197;V (&lt;b&gt;CBu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;/b&gt;/(NH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; AORFB demonstrated exceptional energy storage performance, specifically, 100&#8201;% capacity retention with a discharge energy density of 9.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for 1000 cycles, power densities of up to 85&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and an energy efficiency of 70&#8201;% at 60&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;b&gt;(CBu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;/b&gt; not only represents the most capacity dense viologen with pendant ionic groups and also exhibits the longest (1200&#8197;hours or 50&#8197;days) and the most stable flow battery performance to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimizing Acetylene Sorption through Induced&#8208;fit Transformations in a Chemically Stable Microporous Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid/base&#8208;resistant framework with adaptive pores was prepared; it could effectively capture C2H2 with a record&#8208;high storage density but a very low adsorption enthalpy. Mechanism studies demonstrate that such excellent performance comes from the synergism of active sites, flexible framework, and matched pores, where the adsorbed&#8208;C2H2 can drive framework to undergo continuous induced&#8208;fit transformations, finally leading to dense packing of C2H2.







Abstract
Developing practical storage technologies for acetylene (C2H2) is important but challenging because C2H2 is useful but explosive. Here, a novel metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) (FJI&#8208;H36) with adaptive channels was prepared. It can effectively capture C2H2 (159.9&#8197;cm3&#8201;cm&#8722;3) at 1&#8197;atm and 298&#8197;K, possessing a record&#8208;high storage density (561&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1) but a very low adsorption enthalpy (28&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) among all the reported MOFs. Structural analyses show that such excellent adsorption performance comes from the synergism of active sites, flexible framework, and matched pores; where the adsorbed&#8208;C2H2 can drive FJI&#8208;H36 to undergo induced&#8208;fit transformations step by step, including deformation/reconstruction of channels, contraction of pores, and transformation of active sites, finally leading to dense packing of C2H2. Moreover, FJI&#8208;H36 has excellent chemical stability and recyclability, and can be prepared on a large scale, enabling it as a practical adsorbent for C2H2. This will provide a useful strategy for developing practical and efficient adsorbents for C2H2 storage.

         <title>Aerobic C&#8722;N Bond Formation through Enzymatic Nitroso&#8208;Ene&#8208;Type Reactions
</title>

         <dc:description>
In an exciting case of catalytic promiscuity, peroxidases and laccases participate in C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reactions through the generation of reactive nitroso intermediates from acylated hydroxylamines. The formal allylic C&#8722;H bond activation proceeds with air as the terminal oxidant and provides high yields both in intramolecular and intermolecular amination reactions through this unprecedented biocatalytic nitroso&#8208;ene&#8208;type reaction pathway.







Abstract
The biocatalytic oxidation of acylated hydroxylamines enables the direct and selective introduction of nitrogen functionalities by activation of allylic C&#8722;H bonds. Utilizing either laccases or an oxidase/peroxidase couple for the formal dehydrogenation of N&#8208;hydroxycarbamates and hydroxamic acids with air as the terminal oxidant, acylnitroso species are generated under particularly mild aqueous conditions. The reactive intermediates undergo C&#8722;N bond formation through an ene&#8208;type mechanism and provide high yields both in intramolecular and intermolecular enzymatic aminations. Investigations on different pathways of the two biocatalytic systems and labelling studies provide more insight into this unprecedented promiscuity of classical oxidoreductases as catalysts for nitroso&#8208;based transformations.

         <title>Na2Ba[Na2Sn2S7]: Structural Tolerance Factor&#8208;Guided NLO Performance Improvement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by the relationships between the structural tolerance factor and the dopant concentration and second&#8208;order susceptibility, a better balance between Eg and SHG is realized in Na2Ba [Na2Sn2S7] 1, which exhibits a large Eg of 3.42&#8197;eV and excellent NLO properties (SHG: 1.5&#215;AGS; laser&#8208;induced damage threshold: 12&#215;AGS), representing the best performance among the known Hg&#8208; or As&#8208;free sulfides to date.







Abstract
The strong mutual coupling of and even the opposite change in the key parameters, such as the band gap (Eg) and second&#8208;order harmonic generation (SHG), leads to the extreme scarcity in high&#8208;performance IR nonlinear optical (NLO) chalcogenides. Herein, we report 8 new sulfides, Na2Ba[(AgxNa1&#8722;x)2Sn2S7] (1, x=0; 1&#8197;series, x=0.1&#8211;0.6; Na2Ba[(Li0.58Na0.42)2Sn2S7], 1&#8208;0.6Li); Na2Sr[Cu2Sn2S7] (2); and Na2Ba[Cu2Sn2S7] (3). We use the structural tolerance factor (
) to connect the chemical composition, crystal structure, and NLO properties. Guided by these correlations, a better balance between Eg and SHG is realized in 1, which exhibits a large Eg of 3.42&#8197;eV and excellent NLO properties (SHG: 1.5&#215;AGS; laser&#8208;induced damage threshold: 12&#215;AGS), representing the best performance among the known Hg&#8208; or As&#8208;free sulfides to date.

         <title>Unraveling the Structure Transition and Peroxidase Mimic Activity of Copper Sites over Atomically Dispersed Copper&#8208;Doped Carbonized Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed copper&#8208;doped carbonized polymer dots (CPDs), Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs, with excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity were prepared from copper glutamate (Glu). The Cu binding sites in Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs had a Cu&#8722;N2C2 structure, and Cu&#8722;O bonds were converted into Cu&#8722;C bonds under hydrothermal conditions. DFT calculations showed that H2O2 was cleaved by Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs by a dual&#8208;site catalytic pathway. The Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs enabled intracellular detection of H2O2.







Abstract
The lack of systematic structural resolution makes it difficult to build specific transition&#8208;metal&#8208;atom&#8208;doped carbonized polymer dots (TMA&#8208;doped CPDs). Herein, the structure&#8208;activity relationship between Cu atoms and CPDs was evaluated by studying the peroxidase&#8208;like properties of Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs prepared by using copper glutamate (Glu) with a Cu&#8722;N2O2 initial structure. The results showed that the Cu atoms bound to Glu&#8722;Cu&#8722;CPDs in the form of Cu&#8722;N2C2, indicating that Cu&#8722;O bonds changed into Cu&#8722;C bonds under hydrothermal conditions. This phenomenon was also observed in other copper&#8208;doped CPDs. Moreover, the carboxyl and amino groups content decreased after copper&#8208;atom doping. Theoretical calculations revealed a dual&#8208;site catalytic mechanism for catalyzing H2O2. The detection of intracellular H2O2 suggested their application prospects. Our study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the formation and catalytic mechanism of TMA&#8208;doped&#8208;CPDs, allowing for the generation specific TMA&#8208;doped&#8208;CPDs.

Multifunctional FEC is introduced into aqueous electrolyte to produce a ZnF2&#8208;riched inorganic/organic hybrid SEI (ZHS) layer on Zn metal anode (ZMA) surface. The hydrolysate of FEC can favorably regulate the solvated structure of Zn2+ to restrict the H2O&#8208;related parasitic reactions. The in situ formed ZHS layer not only realize uniform Zn deposition, but also suppresses ZMA corrosion.







Abstract
Uncontrolled dendrites growth and serious parasitic reactions in aqueous electrolytes, greatly hinder the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion battery. On the basis of in situ&#8208;chemical construction and performance&#8208;improving mechanism, multifunctional fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) is introduced into aqueous electrolyte to construct a high&#8208;quality and ZnF2&#8208;riched inorganic/organic hybrid SEI (ZHS) layer on Zn metal anode (ZMA) surface. Notably, FEC additive can regulate the solvated structure of Zn2+ to reduce H2O molecules reactivity. Additionally, the ZHS layer with strong Zn2+ affinity can avoid dendrites formation and hinder the direct contact between the electrolyte and anode. Therefore, the dendrites growth, Zn corrosion, and H2 evolution reaction on ZMA in FEC&#8208;included ZnSO4 electrolyte are highly suppressed. Thus, ZMA in such electrolyte realize a long cycle life over 1000&#8197;h and deliver a stable coulombic efficiency of 99.1&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Impact of the Chlorination of Lithium Argyrodites on the Electrolyte/Cathode Interface in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium argyrodite&#8208;type electrolytes show high ionic conductivity and good processability, but they suffer from interfacial degradation. The influence of chlorination on the interfacial degradation is systematically evaluated here using electrochemical measurements, gas analysis and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. This work highlights the importance of electrolyte modifications.







Abstract
Lithium argyrodite&#8208;type electrolytes are regarded as promising electrolytes due to their high ionic conductivity and good processability. Chemical modifications to increase ionic conductivity have already been demonstrated, but the influence of these modifications on interfacial stability remains so far unknown. In this work, we study Li6PS5Cl and Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 to investigate the influence of halogenation on the electrochemical decomposition of the solid electrolyte and the chemical degradation mechanism at the cathode interface in depth. Electrochemical measurements, gas analysis and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry indicate that the Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 shows pronounced electrochemical decomposition at lower potentials. The chemical reaction at higher voltages leads to more gaseous degradation products, but a lower fraction of solid oxygenated phosphorous and sulfur species. This in turn leads to a decreased interfacial resistance and thus a higher cell performance.

Charged imidazolium struts were integrated into two&#8208;dimensional cobalt porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (Co&#8208;iBFBim&#8208;COF&#8208;X) creating catalytic pockets with 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;porphinatocobalt centers and halogen counter ions (e.g., F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, and I&#8722;). The free imidazolium anions in the proximity of the active Co sites in the Co&#8208;iBFBim&#8208;COF&#8208;X can stabilize the key intermediate *COOH and inhibit the occurrence of HER through hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
We present the first example of charged imidazolium functionalized porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Co&#8208;iBFBim&#8208;COF&#8208;X) for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, where the free anions (e.g., F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, and I&#8722;) of imidazolium ions nearby the active Co sites can stabilize the key intermediate *COOH and inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction. Thus, Co&#8208;iBFBim&#8208;COF&#8208;X exhibits higher activity than the neutral Co&#8208;BFBim&#8208;COF, following the trend of F&#8722;&lt;Cl&#8722;&lt;Br&#8722;&lt;I&#8722;. Particularly, the Co&#8208;iBFBim&#8208;COF&#8208;I&#8722; showed nearly 100&#8201;% CO2 selectivity at a low full&#8208;cell voltage of 2.3&#8197;V, and achieved a high CO2 partial current density of 52&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a turnover frequency of 3018&#8197;h&#8722;1 at 2.4&#8197;V in the anion membrane electrode assembly, which is 3.57 times larger than that of neutral Co&#8208;BFBim&#8208;COF. This work provides new insight into the importance of free anions in the stabilization of intermediates and decreasing the local binding energy of H2O with active moiety to enhance CO2 reduction reaction.

         <title>Folding&#8208;Induced Promotion of Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfers via Proximal Base for Light&#8208;Driven Water Oxidation</title>

         <dc:description>
Structurally flexible, bipyridine&#8208;containing Ru macrocyles have shown a remarkable increase in turnover per Ru center in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven water oxidation catalysis. Conformational studies in the solid state revealed an increased tendency of the auxiliary base close to the active centers of the larger complexes to undergo intramolecular folding and preorganization, which facilitates proton abstraction in the water nucleophilic attack (WNA) pathway.







Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer (PCET) processes play a key role in biocatalytic energy conversion and storage, for example, photosynthesis or nitrogen fixation. Here, we report a series of bipyridine&#8208;containing di&#8208; to tetranuclear Ru(bda) macrocycles 2&#8201;C&#8211;4&#8201;C (bda: 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate) to promote O&#8722;O bond formation. In photocatalytic water oxidation under neutral conditions, all complexes 2&#8201;C&#8211;4&#8201;C prevail in a folded conformation that support the water nucleophilic attack (WNA) pathway with remarkable turnover frequencies of up to 15.5&#8197;s&#8722;1 per Ru unit respectively. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed an increased tendency for intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and preorganization of the proximal bases close to the active centers for the larger macrocycles. H/D kinetic isotope effect studies and electrochemical data demonstrate the key role of the proximal bipyridines as proton acceptors in lowering the activation barrier for the crucial nucleophilic attack of H2O in the WNA mechanism.

         <title>Enhanced Activity of Enzyme Immobilized on Hydrophobic ZIF&#8208;8 Modified by Ni2+ Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile synthesis approach was developed to immobilize enzyme on the ZIF&#8208;8 carrier by using Ni2+ ions as anchor, which can significantly promote the recyclability and activity of the enzyme.







Abstract
The development of efficient enzyme immobilization to promote their recyclability and activity is highly desirable. Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) has been proved to be an effective platform for enzyme immobilization due to its easy preparation and biocompatibility. However, the intrinsic hydrophobic characteristic hinders its further development in this filed. Herein, a facile synthesis approach was developed to immobilize pepsin (PEP) on the ZIF&#8208;8 carrier by using Ni2+ ions as anchor (ZIF&#8208;8@PEP&#8208;Ni). By contrast, the direct coating of PEP on the surface of ZIF&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8@PEP) generated significant conformational changes. Electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was employed to study the catalytic activity of immobilized PEP. The ZIF&#8208;8@PEP&#8208;Ni composite attains remarkable OER performance with an ultralow overpotential of only 127&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is much lower than the 690 and 919&#8197;mV overpotential values of ZIF&#8208;8@PEP and PEP, respectively.

         <title>A Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Approach to Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers by Catalytic Atroposelective Transfer Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic kinetic resolution approach was developed for the synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers via a Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed atroposelective transfer hydrogenation (ATH) reaction of dicarbaldehydes with anilines. The chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution strategy has provided a modular platform for the synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers.







Abstract
Diaryl ethers are widespread in biologically active compounds, ligands and catalysts. It is known that the diaryl ether skeleton may exhibit atropisomerism when both aryl rings are unsymmetrically substituted with bulky groups. Despite recent advances, only very few catalytic asymmetric methods have been developed to construct such axially chiral compounds. We describe herein a dynamic kinetic resolution approach to axially chiral diaryl ethers via a Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed atroposelective transfer hydrogenation (ATH) reaction of dicarbaldehydes with anilines. The desired diaryl ethers could be obtained in moderate to good chemical yields (up to 79&#8201;%) and high enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% ee) under standard reaction conditions. Such structural motifs are interesting precursors for further transformations and may have potential applications in the synthesis of chiral ligands or catalysts.

         <title>Room Temperature Incorporation of Arsenic Atoms into the Germanium (001) Surface
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the discovery that arsenic atoms incorporate substitutionally into the (001) surface of germanium at room temperature when the surface is exposed to arsine (AsH3). We observe several types of incorporated arsenic structures that differ only in the locations of the three adsorbed hydrogen atoms. Arsenic incorporation causes germanium ad&#8208;atoms to be released onto the surface. These results provide a path toward atomic&#8208;scale dopant devices in germanium with clear advantages over silicon.







Abstract
Germanium has emerged as an exceptionally promising material for spintronics and quantum information applications, with significant fundamental advantages over silicon. However, efforts to create atomic&#8208;scale devices using donor atoms as qubits have largely focused on phosphorus in silicon. Positioning phosphorus in silicon with atomic&#8208;scale precision requires a thermal incorporation anneal, but the low success rate for this step has been shown to be a fundamental limitation prohibiting the scale&#8208;up to large&#8208;scale devices. Here, we present a comprehensive study of arsine (AsH3) on the germanium (001) surface. We show that, unlike any previously studied dopant precursor on silicon or germanium, arsenic atoms fully incorporate into substitutional surface lattice sites at room temperature. Our results pave the way for the next generation of atomic&#8208;scale donor devices combining the superior electronic properties of germanium with the enhanced properties of arsine/germanium chemistry that promises scale&#8208;up to large numbers of deterministically placed qubits.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Assisted Halogen Bonding in an Ionic Cavity of a Coordination Cage Based on a Copper(I) Iodide Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual Cu3I4&#8722; based coordination cage was synthesized by a reaction between copper (I) iodide and a tripodal cationic ligand. X&#8208;ray structural evidence demonstrates that this cage can selectively encapsulate bromomethanes by concerted ligand&#8208;iodide&#8208;bromomethane ionic and halogen bonding interactions.







Abstract
The design of molecular containers capable of selectively binding specific guest molecules presents an interesting synthetic challenge in supramolecular chemistry. Here, we report the synthesis and structure of a coordination cage assembled from Cu3I4&#8722; clusters and tripodal cationic N&#8208;donor ligands. Owing to the localized permanent charges in the ligand core the cage binds iodide anions in specific regions within the cage through ionic interactions. This allows the selective binding of bromomethanes as secondary guest species within the cage promoted by halogen bonding, which was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>An Anomalous Electron Configuration Among 3d Transition Metal Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special [Ar]4s1 electron configuration was revealed for Sc2+ in ScS, with no typical 3d orbital features and a bare population of t2g orbital from electron density reconstruction and orbital population analysis. Our work should be the first to report such anomalous electron structure with preferred 4s over 3d orbital for 3d transition metal atoms and may provide a new method to modulate material properties via artificial orbital adjustment.







Abstract
Physical properties of materials are mainly determined by valence electron configurations, where different valence shells would induce divergent phenomena. In compounds containing Sc2+, 3d electron occupancy is expected, the same as other transition metal atoms like Ti3+. But this situation still awaits experimental verification in inorganic materials. Here, we selected ScS to measure the valence electron density and orbital population of Sc2+ through delicate quantitative convergent&#8208;beam electron diffraction. With the absence of 3d orbital features around Sc&#8208;atom sites and the nearly bare population of t2g orbital, the unintuitive occupation of 4s orbital in Sc2+ is concluded. It should be the first time to report such a special electron configuration in a transition metal compound, in which 4s rather than 3d orbital is preferred. Our findings reveal the distinct behavior of Sc and probable ways to modulate material properties by controlling electron orbitals.

         <title>Expanding the Toolbox of Target Directed Bio&#8208;Orthogonal Synthesis: In Situ Direct Macrocyclization by DNA Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the first instance of bioorthogonal macrocyclization directed by non&#8208;canonical DNAs as templates. The size complementarity of the macrocyclic core with the G&#8208;quartet of a G&#8208;quadruplex DNA plays a key role to drive the macrocyclization over oligomerization. In cellulo macrocyclization has also been established leading to a peptidomimetic macrocycle with promising therapeutic properties.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that noncanonical DNA can direct macrocyclization&#8208;like challenging reactions to synthesize gene modulators. The planar G&#8208;quartets present in DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) provide a size complementary reaction platform for the bio&#8208;orthogonal macrocyclization of bifunctional azide and alkyne fragments over oligo&#8208; and polymerization. G4s immobilized on gold&#8208;coated magnetic nanoparticles have been used as target templates to enable easy identification of a selective peptidomimetic macrocycle. Structurally similar macrocycles have been synthesized to understand their functional role in the modulation of gene function. The innate fluorescence of the in situ formed macrocycle has been utilized to monitor its cellular localization using a G4 antibody and its in cell formation from the corresponding azide and alkyne fragments. The successful execution of in situ macrocyclization in vitro and in cells would open up a new dimension for target&#8208;directed therapeutic applications.

         <dc:description>
A new series of high&#8208;dimensional thiocyanate&#8208;/selenocyanate&#8208;bridged networks [Fe (L)m] [Hg (XCN)4]&#8901;solvents (L=phenazine/quinoxaline/4,4&#8242;&#8208;trimethylenedipyridine; X=S/Se) exhibits unique low&#8208;frequency terahertz absorbance and Raman scattering spectra. The phonon&#8208;mode analysis is supported by quantum chemical calculations, indicating the importance of heavy elements in these phenomena and demonstrating the potential of the ab initio method.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly FeII complexes of phenazine (Phen), quinoxaline (Qxn), and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;trimethylenedipyridine (Tmp) with tetrahedral building blocks of [HgII(XCN)4]2&#8722; (X=S or Se) formed six new high&#8208;dimensional frameworks with the general formula of [Fe(L)m][Hg(XCN)4]&#8901;solvents (L=Phen, m/X=2/S, 1; L=Qxn, m/X=2/S, 2; L=Qxn, m/X=1/S, 3; L=Qxn, m/X=1/Se, 3&#8208;Se; L=Tmp, m/X=1/S, 4; and L=Tmp, m/X=1/Se, 4&#8208;Se). 1, 3, and 3&#8208;Se show an intense sub&#8208;terahertz (sub&#8208;THz) absorbance of around 0.60&#8197;THz due to vibrations of the solvent molecules coordinated to the FeII ions and crystallization organic molecules. In addition, crystals of 1, 4, and 4&#8208;Se display low&#8208;frequency Raman scattering with exceptionally low values of 0.44, 0.51, and 0.53&#8197;THz, respectively. These results indicate that heavy metal FeII&#8722;HgII systems are promising platforms to construct sub&#8208;THz absorbers.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release Driven Epoxidation and Aziridination of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes via Palladium Catalyzed &#963;&#8208;Bond Nucleopalladation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strained spirocyclic epoxides and aziridines were synthesized via three&#8208;component coupling between in situ generated 1&#8208;lithio bicyclo [1.1.0]butane, a broad variety of ketones, aldehydes and N&#8208;tosyl imines, and aryl triflates. The key step involves a highly diastereoselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond alkoxyarylation (or aminoarylation) of bicyclo [1.1.0]butyl carbinolate intermediates.







Abstract
The development of preparative methods for the synthesis of four&#8208;membered carbocycles is gaining increasing importance due to the widespread utility of cyclic compounds in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report the development of a new methodology for the production of spirocyclic epoxides and aziridines containing a cyclobutane motif. In a two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot process, a bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl sulfoxide is lithiated and added to a ketone, aldehyde or imine, and the resulting intermediate is cross&#8208;coupled with an aryl triflate through C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond alkoxy&#8208; or aminopalladation with concomitant epoxide or aziridine formation. After careful optimization, a remarkably efficient reaction was conceived that tolerated a broad variety of both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. Lastly, through several high yielding ring&#8208;opening reactions, we demonstrated the excellent applicability of the products as modular building blocks for the introduction of three&#8208;dimensional structures into target molecules.

         <title>Significant Enhancement of the Upconversion Emission in Highly Er3+&#8208;Doped Nanoparticles at Cryogenic Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing a cryogenic environment to suppress the harmful cross relaxation, the upconversion intensity of Er3+&#8208;rich core&#8211;shell structures can be significantly improved over 100&#8208;fold, together with an over 50&#8208;fold modulation on the red&#8208;to&#8208;green emission ratio.







Abstract
Relatively low efficiency is the bottleneck for the application of lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). The high&#8208;level doping strategy realized in recent years has not improved the efficiency as much as expected. It is argued that cross relaxation (CR) is not detrimental to upconversion. Here we combine theoretical simulation and spectroscopy to elucidate the role of CR in upconversion process of Er3+ highly doped (HD) UCNPs. It is found that if CR is purposively suppressed, upconversion efficiency can be significantly improved. Specifically, we demonstrate experimentally that inhibition of CR by introducing cryogenic environment (40&#8197;K) enhances upconversion emission by more than two orders of magnitude. This work not only elucidates the nature of CR and its non&#8208;negligible adverse effects, but also provides a new perspective for improving upconversion efficiency. The result can be directly applied to cryogenic imaging and wide range temperature sensing.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Electronic Control of the Scholl Reaction: Selective Synthesis of Spiro vs Helical Nanographenes (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 7/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different electronic effects in the starting anthracene&#8208;containing polyphenylene substrate (bottom) afford two different nanographenes under Scholl reaction conditions, namely spironanographenes (R=H) on the left and a helically arranged molecular nanographene having two orthogonal aromatic moieties linked by an octafluoroanthracene core (R=F) on the right. The different stabilities of the intermediate trityl cations and the concomitant gain of aromaticity decide the fate of the reaction, as explained by Israel Fern&#225;ndez, Nazario Mart&#237;n, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202215655).

         <title>Back Cover: Optimizing Acetylene Sorption through Induced&#8208;fit Transformations in a Chemically Stable Microporous Framework (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 7/2023)</title>

Optimizing acetylene (C2H2) sorption through induced&#8208;fit transformations of a metal&#8211;organic framework has been achieved. In their Research Article (e202215253), Qihui Chen, Daqiang Yuan, Maochun Hong, and co&#8208;workers describe the preparation of an adaptive ultramicroporous framework that effectively captures C2H2 with a record&#8208;high storage density but a very low adsorption enthalpy. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the excellent adsorption performance is due to the synergism of active sites, a flexible framework, and matched pores.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen bonding strategy for achieving an excellent electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction performance over an imidazolium&#8208;functionalized covalent organic framework (Co&#8208;iBFBim&#8208;COF&#8208;X) is reported by Yuan&#8208;Biao Huang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202215687). The halogen anions can form hydrogen bonds with intermediates (*COOH) and thus lower the energy barrier to the formation of CO. Moreover, the water&#8211;anion interactions can repel the contact of water with the active centers, thus inhibiting the occurrence of HER.

DNA secondary structures present in the telomere and oncogene promoter proximally orient bifunctional alkyne and azide fragments, enabling bond formation by copper&#8208;free azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition in live cells. The high&#8208;affinity DNA binding macrocyclic ligand efficiently suppresses oncogene expression in cancer cells.

         <title>Emerging Lithiated Organic Cathode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview systematically summarizes the recent progress on emerging lithiated organic cathode materials, including their synthesis, stability, and half&#8208; and full&#8208;battery applications. The biggest advantage of lithiated organic cathode materials is that they can act as a Li reservoir to couple with Li&#8208;free anodes for lithium&#8208;ion full batteries.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials have application potential in lithium batteries owing to their high capacity, abundant resources, and structural designability. However, most reported organic cathodes are at oxidized states (namely unlithiated compounds) and thus need to couple with Li&#8208;rich anodes. In contrast, lithiated organic cathode materials could act as a Li reservoir and match with Li&#8208;free anodes such as graphite, showing great promise for practical full&#8208;battery applications. Here we summarize the synthesis, stability, and battery applications of lithiated organic cathode materials, including synthetic methods, stability against O2 and H2O in air, and strategies to improve comprehensive electrochemical performance. Future research should be focused on new redox chemistries and the construction of full batteries with lithiated organic cathodes and commercial anodes under practical conditions. This Minireview will encourage more efforts on lithiated organic cathode materials and finally promote their commercialization.

         <dc:description>
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) that integrates Fenton chemistry and biomedicine provides strategies for cancer treatment with nanomedicine; however, the exact mechanism of CDT is not fully understood. In this Scientific Perspective, the conceptual framework of CDT is clarified and research approaches that illuminate its chemical and biological mechanisms are discussed. Beneficial outlooks for CDT are provided to inspire new advances in the field.







Abstract
Since the insight to fuse Fenton chemistry and nanomedicine into cancer therapy, great signs of progress have been made in the field of chemodynamic therapy (CDT). However, the exact mechanism of CDT is obscured by the unique tumor chemical environment and inevitable nanoparticle&#8208;cell interactions, thus impeding further development. In this Scientific Perspective, the significance of CDT is clarified, the complex mechanism is deconstructed into primitive chemical and biological interactions, and the mechanism research directions based on the chemical kinetics and biological signaling pathways are discussed in detail. Moreover, beneficial outlooks are presented to enlighten the evolution of next&#8208;generation CDT. Hopefully, this Scientific Perspective can inspire new ideas and advances for CDT and provide a reference for breaking down the interdisciplinary barriers in the field of nanomedicine.

         <title>Single mRNA Imaging with Fluorogenic RNA Aptamers and Small&#8208;molecule Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview covers the recent advances in the development of small&#8208;molecule fluorophores and fluorogenic RNA aptamers for single mRNA imaging. We summarized the pros and cons, and photochemical properties of five different RNA aptamers: small&#8208;molecule fluorophores systems and how they can be applied to single&#8208;molecule mRNA imaging.







Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the fundamental information transfer system in the cell. Tracking single mRNA from transcription to degradation with fluorescent probes provides spatiotemporal information in cells about how the genetic information is transferred from DNA to proteins. The traditional single mRNA imaging approach utilizes RNA hairpins (e.g. MS2) and tethered fluorescent protein as probes. As an exciting alternative, RNA aptamers: small&#8208;molecule fluorophores (SFs) systems have emerged as novel single mRNA imaging probes since 2019, exhibiting several advantages including fluorogenic ability and minimal perturbation.

     alt="Single mRNA Imaging with Fluorogenic RNA Aptamers and Small-molecule Fluorophores"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Minireview covers the recent advances in the development of small-molecule fluorophores and fluorogenic RNA aptamers for single mRNA imaging. We summarized the pros and cons, and photochemical properties of five different RNA aptamers: small-molecule fluorophores systems and how they can be applied to single-molecule mRNA imaging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the fundamental information transfer system in the cell. Tracking single mRNA from transcription to degradation with fluorescent probes provides spatiotemporal information in cells about how the genetic information is transferred from DNA to proteins. The traditional single mRNA imaging approach utilizes RNA hairpins (e.g. MS2) and tethered fluorescent protein as probes. As an exciting alternative, RNA aptamers: small-molecule fluorophores (SFs) systems have emerged as novel single mRNA imaging probes since 2019, exhibiting several advantages including fluorogenic ability and minimal perturbation. This review summarizes all five reported RNA aptamers: SFs systems for single mRNA imaging in living cells so far. It also discusses the challenges and provides prospects for single mRNA imaging applications. This review is expected to inspire researchers to develop RNA aptamers: SFs systems for studying gene expression at single-molecule resolution in cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on Covalent Triazine Frameworks: at the Crossroad between Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review highlights single&#8208;atom catalysis on covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), thus focusing on the available insights on factors influencing nuclearity and coordination environment of metal species on CTFs and the effect on catalytic performance.







Abstract
Heterogeneous single&#8208;site and single&#8208;atom catalysts potentially enable combining the high catalytic activity and selectivity of molecular catalysts with the easy continuous operation and recycling of solid catalysts. In recent years, covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) found increasing attention as support materials for particulate and isolated metal species. Bearing a high fraction of nitrogen sites, they allow coordinating molecular metal species and stabilizing particulate metal species, respectively. Dependent on synthesis method and pretreatment of CTFs, materials resembling well&#8208;defined highly crosslinked polymers or materials comparable to structurally ill&#8208;defined nitrogen&#8208;containing carbons result. Accordingly, CTFs serve as model systems elucidating the interaction of single&#8208;site, single&#8208;atom and particulate metal species with such supports. Factors influencing the transition between molecular and particulate systems are discussed to allow deriving tailored catalyst systems.

         <title>Aluminoborates as Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent research advances and prospects of aluminoborates have been systematically surveyed and analyzed focusing on the structural chemistry and nonlinear optical property, which indicates that emerging fluoroaluminoborates are promising UV/DUV nonlinear optical materials.







Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) and Deep&#8208;UV (DUV, &#955;&lt;200&#8197;nm) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials play a significant role to convert the wavelength of laser for producing UV/DUV coherent light in the laser industry. The Al [Ne]3s23p1 atom with empty d orbitals can form sp3, sp3d, and sp3d2 hybrid orbitals when bonding with O/F atoms, which leads to the construction of [AlOmFn] (m+n=4, 5, 6) units. Therein, aluminoborates have received intensive attention due to the effective structural and functional adjustment effects of the diverse Al&#8722;O/F units. Accordingly, numerous aluminoborates as candidates for the next generation of UV/DUV NLO materials were discovered. In this review, recently discovered aluminoborates are overviewed and analyzed, including their syntheses, crystal structure features, and second&#8208;order NLO performances. We aim to provide the latest progress and outlook on the crystal chemistry of aluminoborates and boost the finding of the next NLO candidates with high performances.

         <title>Direct Excitation of Aldehyde to Activate the C(sp2)&#8722;H Bond by Cobaloxime Catalysis toward Fluorenones Synthesis with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct excitation of aldehydes to activate their C (sp2)&#8722;H bond through cobaloxime catalysis has been successfully developed. Upon irradiation, the highly reactive photoexcited triplet state of aromatic aldehyde intermediates is intercepted by the catalyst in the ground state, thus leading to the synthesis of a series of fluorenones, xanthones and thioxanthones in good to excellent yields without any external oxidants and with hydrogen as the byproduct.







Abstract
A new way to form fluorenones via the direct excitation of substrates instead of photocatalyst to activate the C(sp2)&#8722;H bond under redox&#8208;neutral condition is reported. Our design relies on the photoexcited aromatic aldehyde intermediates that can be intercepted by cobaloxime catalyst through single electron transfer for following &#946;&#8208;H elimination. The generation of acyl radical and successful interception by a metal catalyst cobaloxime avoid the use of a photocatalyst and stoichiometric external oxidants, affording a series of highly substituted fluorenones, including six&#8208;membered ketones, such as xanthone and thioxanthone derivatives in good to excellent yields, and with hydrogen as the only byproduct. This catalytic system features a readily available metal catalyst, mild reaction conditions and broad substrate scope, in which sunlight reaction and scale&#8208;up experiments by continuous&#8208;flow approach make the new methodology sustainable and amenable for potentially operational procedures.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Enantioselective Addition of a Silicon Nucleophile to 3&#8208;Substituted 2H&#8208;Azirines Using an Si&#8722;B Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic asymmetric synthesis of C&#8208;silylated, unprotected aziridines has been accomplished. Using a silyl boronic ester as a latent silicon nucleophile, a chiral copper catalyst enables its addition of 3&#8208;substituted 2H&#8208;azirines in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. These azirines can be considered strained cyclic and hence reactive ketimines, for which an effective silylation is still not known.







Abstract
3&#8208;Substituted 2H&#8208;azirines can be considered strained cyclic ketimines, and highly enantioselective addition reactions of silicon nucleophiles to either acyclic or cyclic ketimines have been elusive so far. The present work closes this gap for those azirines by means of a copper&#8208;catalyzed silylation using a silyl boronic ester as a latent silicon nucleophile. The resulting C&#8208;silylated, unprotected (N&#8722;H) aziridines are obtained in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities and can be further converted into valuable compounds with hardly any erosion of the enantiomeric excess.

The as&#8208;fabricated Al/COF&#8208;Azu/ITO memristor shows typical non&#8208;volatile resistive switching performance. Associated with its unique memristive performance, a simple convolutional neural network is built for image recognition.







Abstract
As a conjugated and unsymmetric building block composed of an electron&#8208;poor seven&#8208;membered sp2 carbon ring and an electron&#8208;rich five&#8208;membered carbon ring, azulene and its derivatives have been recognized as one of the most promising building blocks for novel electronic devices due to its intrinsic redox activity. By using 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;benzene and azulene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbaldehyde as the starting materials, an azulene(Azu)&#8208;based 2D conjugated covalent organic framework, COF&#8208;Azu, is prepared through liquid&#8208;liquid interface polymerization strategy for the first time. The as&#8208;fabricated Al/COF&#8208;Azu/indium tin oxide (ITO) memristor shows typical non&#8208;volatile resistive switching performance due to the electric filed induced intramolecular charge transfer effect. Associated with the unique memristive performance, a simple convolutional neural network is built for image recognition. After 8 epochs of training, image recognition accuracy of 80&#8201;% for a neutral network trained on a larger data set is achieved.

         <title>Monitoring Transformations of Catalytic Active States in Photocathodes Based on MoSx Layers on CuInS2 Using In Operando Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical state of a CuInS2/MoSx photocathode surface was investigated by Raman spectroscopy under actual photoelectrochemical H2 evolution reaction conditions. In operando Raman spectroscopy revealed the nature of MoSx activation during PEC H2 evolution, which was not revealed by ex situ XPS or Raman spectroscopy. In operando Raman spectroscopy characterization is a promising tool for photoelectrochemical cells.







Abstract
The electrochemical activation of CuInS2/MoSx for photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2 production was revealed for the first time through in operando Raman spectroscopy. During the activation process, the initial metallic MoSx phase was transformed to semiconducting MoSx, which facilitates charge carrier transfer between CuInS2 and MoSx. Ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy suggest the existence of MoO3 after the activation process. However, apart from contradicting these results, in operando Raman spectroscopy revealed some of the intermediate steps of the activation process.

         <dc:description>
A modified nucleotide for construction of reactive RNA probes that form covalent cross&#8208;linked conjugates with Cys&#8208; or His&#8208;containing peptides and proteins is reported. The nucleotide and probes are promising tools for applications in RNA (bio)conjugations or RNA proteomics.







Abstract
Reactive RNA probes are useful for studying and identifying RNA&#8208;binding proteins. To that end, we designed and synthesized chloroacetamide&#8208;linked 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;ATP which was a good substrate for T7 RNA polymerase in in vitro transcription assay to synthesize reactive RNA probes bearing one or several reactive modifications. Modified RNA probes reacted with thiol&#8208;containing molecules as well as with cysteine&#8208; or histidine&#8208;containing peptides to form stable covalent products. They also reacted selectively with RNA&#8208;binding proteins to form cross&#8208;linked conjugates in high conversions thanks to proximity effect. Our modified nucleotide and RNA probes are promising tools for applications in RNA (bio)conjugations or RNA proteomics.

         <title>Rapid and Selective Photo&#8208;degradation of Polymers: Design of an Alternating Copolymer with an o&#8208;Nitrobenzyl Ether Pendant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a vinyl ether monomer with a photo&#8208;deprotectable o&#8208;nitrobenzyl pendant and synthesized an alternating copolymer with an oNBn&#8208;capped acetal backbone via cationic copolymerization with p&#8208;tolualdehyde. This copolymer rapidly degrades into lower&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight compounds upon exposure to UV irradiation, whereas it is stable toward heat and ambient light.







Abstract
The development of polymers with on&#8208;demand degradability is required to alleviate the current global issues on polymer&#8208;waste pollution. Therefore, we designed a vinyl ether monomer with an o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (oNBn) group as a photo&#8208;deprotectable pendant (oNBnVE) and synthesized an alternating copolymer with an oNBn&#8208;capped acetal backbone via cationic copolymerization with p&#8208;tolualdehyde (pMeBzA). The resultant alternating copolymer could be rapidly degraded into lower&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight compounds upon simple exposure to UV irradiation without any reactants or catalysts, while it was sufficiently stable toward heat and ambient light. This degradation proceeds via cleavage of the hemiacetal structure generated upon photo&#8208;deprotection of the oNBn pendant. The oNBn&#8208;peculiar degradability allowed the exclusive photo&#8208;degradation of the oNBnVE/pMeBzA segments in a diblock copolymer composed of oNBnVE/pMeBzA and benzyl vinyl ether (BnVE)/pMeBzA segments.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Cross&#8208;Electrophile Alkyl&#8208;Alkyl Couplings of Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a unified protocol for the regiodivergent nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of two distinct alkyl bromides has been established, providing access to &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, &#948;&#8208;alkylated amides. This catalytic protocol relies on a good practical regiocontrol for installing alkyl groups and provides orthogonal access to diverse branched architectures with remote saturated carbon centers while starting from identical substrates.







Abstract
Functionalizing specific positions on a saturated alkyl molecule is a key challenge in synthetic chemistry. Herein, a ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent alkylations of alkyl bromides at different positions by Ni&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;electrophile coupling with the second alkyl bromides has been developed. The reaction undergoes site&#8208;selective isomerization on one alkyl bromides in a controlled manner, providing switchable access to diverse alkylated structures at different sites of alkyl bromides. The reaction occurs at three similar positions with excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, representing a remarkable ligand tuned reactivity between alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling and nickel migration along the hydrocarbon side chain. This reaction offers a catalytic platform to diverse saturated architectures by alkyl&#8208;alkyl bond&#8208;formation from identical starting materials.

         <title>Cyanide Binding to [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Stabilizes the Alternative Configuration of the Proton Transfer Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
[FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases are highly efficient H2 biocatalysts that employ intrinsic CN&#8722; ligands. Here, extrinsic CN&#8722; is shown to bind at the open coordination site of the catalytic center. Additionally, new conformations within the proton transfer pathway that are complementary to those in the oxidized state Hox are observed, providing a structural basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms of rapid proton shuttling within enzymes.







Abstract
Hydrogenases are H2 converting enzymes that harbor catalytic cofactors in which iron (Fe) ions are coordinated by biologically unusual carbon monoxide (CO) and cyanide (CN&#8722;) ligands. Extrinsic CO and CN&#8722;, however, inhibit hydrogenases. The mechanism by which CN&#8722; binds to [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases is not known. Here, we obtained crystal structures of the CN&#8722;&#8208;treated [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase CpI from Clostridium pasteurianum. The high resolution of 1.39&#8197;&#197; allowed us to distinguish intrinsic CN&#8722; and CO ligands and to show that extrinsic CN&#8722; binds to the open coordination site of the cofactor where CO is known to bind. In contrast to other inhibitors, CN&#8722; treated crystals show conformational changes of conserved residues within the proton transfer pathway which could allow a direct proton transfer between E279 and S319. This configuration has been proposed to be vital for efficient proton transfer, but has never been observed structurally.

         <title>Collective Synthesis of Chiral Tetrasubstituted Cyclobutanes Enabled by Enantioconvergent Negishi Cross&#8208;Coupling of Cyclobutenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allylic substitution of readily available dichlorocyclobutenones and subsequent enantioconvergent Negishi coupling afforded 2,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted cyclobutenones. Further structural elaborations provided a group of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted cyclobutanes with different stereochemical classes.







Abstract
Cyclobutenones provide a straightforward four&#8208;carbon ring platform for further structural elaborations in that every carbon atom of the ring could be potentially functionalized. We report here a nickel catalyzed enantioconvergent Negishi coupling of 4&#8208;iodocyclobutenones with an array of aryl or alkenyl zinc reagents to access enantioenriched 4&#8208;substituted cyclobutenones, from which a modular approach to the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted cyclobutanes was demonstrated.

         <title>Impact of Mineralizing Agents on Aluminum Distribution and Acidity of ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mineralizing agents F&#8722; and OH&#8722; directly influence aluminum distribution in ZSM&#8208;5. The proportion of Al sites depends on the Si/Al ratio for F&#8722;, but remains identical for OH&#8722; (from Si/Al=30 to 760). This effect offers a simple and new opportunity to control zeolite acidity and further reactivity.







Abstract
Intensive research on improving the catalytic properties of zeolites is focused on modulating their acidity and the distribution of associated Al sites. Herein, by studying a series of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites over a broad range of Al content, we demonstrate how the nature of the mineralizing agent (F&#8722; or OH&#8722;) used in hydrothermal syntheses directly impacts Al sites distribution. The proportions of Al sites, probed by 27Al NMR, depend on the Si/Al ratio for F&#8722;, but remain identical for OH&#8722; (from Si/Al=30 to 760). This leads to contrasting variations in weak and strong acidities. Such opposite effect of mineralizers is explained by the spatial location of negative charges and the resulting balance between short&#8208; and long&#8208;range electrostatic interactions. This understanding paves the way for additional and simple opportunities to control zeolites&#8217; acidity.

         <title>Unprecedented Relaxivity Gap in pH&#8208;Responsive FeIII&#8208;Based MRI Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two ferric chelates act as molecular probes for a changing pH by a 21&#8208; and 71&#8208;fold change in their relaxivity. This unprecedented performance became possible thanks to a pendant&#8208;arm design within the hexadentate ligand ensuring virtually complete coordination at high pH and de&#8208;coordination at low pH. Both probes do not show any detectable fatigue over several activation/de&#8208;activation cycles, underscoring the elevated robustness of the system.







Abstract
Two mononuclear ferric complexes are reported that respond to a pH change with a 27&#8208; and 71&#8208;fold jump, respectively, in their capacity to accelerate the longitudinal relaxation rate of water&#8208;hydrogen nuclei, and this starting from a negligible base value of only 0.06. This unprecedented performance bodes well for tackling the sensitivity issues hampering the development of Molecular MRI. The two chelates also excel in the fully reversible and fatigue&#8208;less nature of this phenomenon. The structural reasons for this performance reside in the macrocyclic nature of the hexa&#8208;dentate ligand, as well as the presence of a single pendant arm displaying a five&#8208;membered lactam or carbamate which show (perturbed) pKa values of 3.5 in the context of this N6
N5O1 coordination motif.

         <title>A Configurationally Confined Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Two&#8208;Coordinate CuI Complex for Efficient Blue Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) two&#8208;coordinate CuI complex is designed by configurationally confined strategy. With proper twist angle around 45&#176; between ligands, fast radiative decay is achieved with balanced &#916;EST and kr of S1, meanwhile, knr is also depressed. As demonstrated in efficient OLED with high EQE over 20&#8201;% and small efficiency roll&#8208;off less than 2&#8201;%, configurationally confined strategy is practical for developing novel CuI TADF emitters.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from linear two&#8208;coordinate coinage metal complexes is sensitive to the geometric arrangement of the ligands. Herein we realize the tuning of configuration from coplanar to orthogonal gradually by variation of substituents. In a complex with confined twist configuration, its blue emission peaking at 458&#8197;nm presents a high &#934;PL of 0.74 and a short &#964;TADF of 1.9 &#956;s, which indicates a fast enough kr,TADF of 3.9&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1 and a depressed knr of 1.4&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1. Such outstanding luminescent properties are attributed to the proper overlap of HOMO and LUMO on CuI d orbitals that guarantees not only small &#916;EST but also sufficient transition oscillator strength for fast 
. Vacuum&#8208;deposited blue OLEDs with either doped or host&#8208;free emissive layer present external quantum efficiencies over 20&#8201;% and 10&#8201;%, respectively, demonstrating the practicality of the configurationally confined strategy for efficient linear CuI TADF emitters.

         <title>Chiral Alcohols from Alkenes and Water: Directed Evolution of a Styrene Hydratase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective addition of water across unactivated alkenes is a much sought&#8208;after chemical transformation and a major challenge in catalysis. Now a promiscuous engineered fatty acid hydratase produces chiral alcohols with high enantioselectivity, also on a preparative scale, using simple alkenes and water as reactants.







Abstract
Enantioselective synthesis of chiral alcohols through asymmetric addition of water across an unactivated alkene is a highly sought&#8208;after transformation and a big challenge in catalysis. Herein we report the identification and directed evolution of a fatty acid hydratase from Marinitoga hydrogenitolerans for the highly enantioselective hydration of styrenes to yield chiral 1&#8208;arylethanols. While directed evolution for styrene hydration was performed in the presence of heptanoic acid to mimic fatty acid binding, the engineered enzyme displayed remarkable asymmetric styrene hydration activity in the absence of the small molecule activator. The evolved styrene hydratase provided access to chiral alcohols from simple alkenes and water with high enantioselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.) and could be applied on a preparative scale.

         <title>A Widely Distributed Biosynthetic Cassette Is Responsible for Diverse Plant Side Chain Cross&#8208;Linked Cyclopeptides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopeptide alkaloids are a diverse class of plants natural products, yet little is known of their biosynthesis. By combining transcriptomics and genome mining, we uncover a widespread biosynthetic cassette responsible for side chain cross&#8208;linked cyclopeptides. We validate these observations by isolating a new cyclopeptide from Coffea arabica and reconstituting enzymatic activity for the family defining split BURP peptide cyclase.







Abstract
Cyclopeptide alkaloids are an abundant class of plant cyclopeptides with over 200 analogs described and bioactivities ranging from analgesic to antiviral. While these natural products have been known for decades, their biosynthetic basis remains unclear. Using a transcriptome&#8208;mining approach, we link the cyclopeptide alkaloids from Ceanothus americanus to dedicated RiPP precursor peptides and identify new, widely distributed split BURP peptide cyclase containing gene clusters. Guided by our bioinformatic analysis, we identify and isolate new cyclopeptides from Coffea arabica, which we named arabipeptins. Reconstitution of the enzyme activity for the BURP found in the biosynthesis of arabipeptin A validates the activity of the newly discovered split BURP peptide cyclases. These results expand our understanding of the biosynthetic pathways responsible for diverse cyclic plant peptides and suggest that these side chain cross&#8208;link modifications are widely distributed in eudicots.

High&#8208;performance electrode based on earth&#8208;abundant elements synthesized simply in the presence of H2O2, enabling the selective electrooxidation of many organic molecules to value&#8208;added products at industrial current densities.







Abstract
Hydrogen generated in electrolyzers is discussed as a key element in future energy scenarios, but oxygen evolution as the standard anode reaction is a complex multi&#8208;step reaction requiring a high overpotential. At the same time,it does not add value&#8208;the oxygen is typically released into the atmosphere. Alternative anode reactions which can proceed at similar current densities as the hydrogen evolution are, therefore, of highest interest. We have discovered a high&#8208;performance electrode based on earth&#8208;abundant elements synthesized in the presence of H2O2, which is able to sustain current densities of close to 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the oxidation of many organic molecules, which are partly needed at high production volumes. Such anode reactions could generate additional revenue streams, which help to solve one of the most important problems in the transition to renewable energy systems, i.e. the cost of hydrogen electrolysis.

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Tension PAINT Imaging with a Molecular Beacon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constraints such as low imager concentration, thin illumination volume, and long exposure time limit the potential of traditional DNA&#8208;PAINT in fast live&#8208;cell imaging. MB&#8208;PAINT removes these constraints by eliminating background fluorescence and localization artifacts caused by free&#8208;diffusing imagers in traditional DNA&#8208;PAINT, thus enabling fast super&#8208;resolution imaging of living cells, and particularly in tension imaging.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;PAINT enabled super&#8208;resolution imaging through the transient binding of fluorescently&#8208;labelled single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) imagers to target ssDNA. However, its performance is constrained by imager background fluorescence, resulting in relatively long image acquisition and potential artifacts. We designed a molecular beacon (MB) as the PAINT imager. Unbound MB in solution reduces the background fluorescence due to its natively quenched state. They are fluorogenic upon binding to target DNA to create individual fluorescence events. We demonstrate that MB&#8208;PAINT provides localization precision similar to traditional linear imager DNA&#8208;PAINT. We also show that MB&#8208;PAINT is ideally suited for fast super&#8208;resolution imaging of molecular tension probes in living cells, eliminating the potential of artifacts from free&#8208;diffusing imagers in traditional DNA&#8208;PAINT at the cell&#8208;substrate interface.

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into Peptidyl&#8208;Cysteine Oxidation by the Copper&#8208;Dependent Formylglycine&#8208;Generating Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
QM/MM calculations reveal the reaction mechanism of the FGE&#8208;catalyzed oxidative conversion of peptidyl&#8208;cysteines into formylglycine. Triplet&#8208;singlet crossing initiates the rate&#8208;limiting hydrogen atom abstraction from substrate to generate a CuII&#8722;OOH species. A nearby water molecule plays a vital role in the formation of the CuI&#8208;alkylperoxo intermediate, which is the key species that can undergo O&#8722;O bond cleavage to give formylglycine.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;dependent formylglycine&#8208;generating enzyme (FGE) catalyzes the oxygen&#8208;dependent oxidation of specific peptidyl&#8208;cysteine residues to formylglycine. Our QM/MM calculations provide a very likely mechanism for this transformation. The reaction starts with dioxygen binding to the tris&#8208;thiolate CuI center to form a triplet CuII&#8208;superoxide complex. The rate&#8208;determining hydrogen atom abstraction involves a triplet&#8208;singlet crossing to form a CuII&#8722;OOH species that couples with the substrate radical, leading to a CuI&#8208;alkylperoxo intermediate. This is accompanied by proton transfer from the hydroperoxide to the S atom of the substrate via a nearby water molecule. The subsequent O&#8722;O bond cleavage is coupled with the C&#8722;S bond breaking that generates the formylglycine and a CuII&#8208;oxyl complex. Moreover, our results suggest that the aldehyde oxygen of the final product originates from O2, which will be useful for future experimental work.

Triplet-singlet crossing initiates the rate-limiting hydrogen atom abstraction from substrate to generate a Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;OOH species. A nearby water molecule plays a vital role in the formation of the Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-alkylperoxo intermediate, which is the key species that can undergo O&#8722;O bond cleavage to give formylglycine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copper-dependent formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE) catalyzes the oxygen-dependent oxidation of specific peptidyl-cysteine residues to formylglycine. Our QM/MM calculations provide a very likely mechanism for this transformation. The reaction starts with dioxygen binding to the tris-thiolate Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; center to form a triplet Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-superoxide complex. The rate-determining hydrogen atom abstraction involves a triplet-singlet crossing to form a Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;OOH species that couples with the substrate radical, leading to a Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-alkylperoxo intermediate. This is accompanied by proton transfer from the hydroperoxide to the S atom of the substrate via a nearby water molecule. The subsequent O&#8722;O bond cleavage is coupled with the C&#8722;S bond breaking that generates the formylglycine and a Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-oxyl complex. Moreover, our results suggest that the aldehyde oxygen of the final product originates from O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which will be useful for future experimental work.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Variation in anion and cation structure upon changing from crystalline solid to glass to liquid dimeric lanthanide&#8208;containing compounds.







Abstract
Herein, we report on the preparation of liquid dimeric lanthanide(III)&#8208;containing compounds. Starting from the design of dimeric solids, we demonstrate that by tuning of anion and cation structures we can lower the melting points below room temperature, whilst maintaining the dimeric structure. Magnetic measurements could establish the spin&#8208;spin interactions of the neighboring lanthanide(III) ions in the liquid state at low temperatures, and matched the interactions of the analogous crystalline solid compounds.

         <title>Rapid and Modular Access to Vinyl Cyclopropanes Enabled by Air&#8208;stable Palladium(I) Dimer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 7, February 6, 2023. </description>

This report showcases the stereospecific and modular synthesis of vinyl cyclopropanes in less than 30&#8197;min at room temperature, employing air&#8208;stable dinuclear PdI catalysis.







Abstract
While vinyl cyclopropanes are valuable functional groups in drugs or natural products as well as established precursors to trigger a rich variety of synthetic transformations, their reactive nature can make their installation via direct catalytic approaches challenging. We herein present a modular access to (di)vinyl cyclopropanes under very mild conditions and full conservation of stereochemistry, allowing access to the cis or trans cyclopropane&#8208; as well as E or Z vinyl&#8208;stereochemical relationships. Our protocol relies on air&#8208;stable dinuclear PdI catalysis, which enables rapid (&lt;30&#8197;min) and selective access to a diverse range of vinyl cyclopropane motifs at room temperature, even on gram scale.

         <title>Ligand Assisted Thermal Atomization of Palladium Clusters: A Hint for Rational Design of Atomically Dispersed Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transformation from metal nanocluster catalysts to metal single&#8208;atom catalysts is an important procedure in the rational design of atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADCs). However, the conversion methods often involve high annealing temperature as well as reducing atmosphere. Herein, we reported a continuous and convenient conversion of Pd nanocluster to Pd single&#8208;atom in a ligand assisted annealing procedure, by which means we reduced its activating temperature low to 400 &#176;C. Using ex&#8208;situ microscopy and spectroscopy, we comprehensively monitored the structural evolution of Pd species though the whole atomization process. Theoretical calculation revealed that the structural instability caused by remaining Cl ligands was the main reason for this low&#8208;temperature transformation. The present atomization strategy and mechanistic knowledge for the conversion from cluster to atomic dispersion provides guidelines for the rational design of ADCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(I) Photocatalyzed Bromonitroalkylation of Olefins: Evidence for Highly Efficient Inner&#8208;Sphere Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the visible light&#8208;mediated copper&#8208;catalyzed vicinal difunctionalization of olefins utilizing bromonitroalkanes as ATRA reagents. This protocol is characterized by high yields and fast reaction times under environmentally benign reaction conditions with exceptional scope, allowing the rapid functionalization of both activated and unactivated olefins. Moreover, late&#8208;stage function&#173;nalization of biologically active molecules and upscaling to gram quantities is demonstrated, which offers manifold possibilities for further transformations, e.g. access to nitro&#8208; and aminocyclo&#173;propanes. Besides the synthetic utility of the title transformation, this study undergirds the exclusive role of copper in photoredox catalysis showing its ability to stabilize and interact with radical intermediates in its coordination sphere. EPR studies suggest that such interactions can even outperform a highly favorable cyclization of transient to persis&#173;tent radicals contrasting iridium&#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>An Isotope&#8208;Labeled Single&#8208;Cell Raman Spectroscopy Approach for Tracking the Physiological Evolution Trajectory of Bacteria toward Antibiotic Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding evolution of antibiotic resistance is vital for containing its global spread. Yet our ability to in situ track highly heterogenous and dynamic evolution is very limited. Here, we present a new single&#8208;cell approach integrating D2O&#8208;labeled Raman spectroscopy, advanced multivariate analysis, and genotypic profiling to in situ track physiological evolution trajectory toward resistance. Physiological diversification of individual cells from isogenic population with cyclic ampicillin treatment is captured. Advanced multivariate analysis of spectral changes classifies all individual cells into four subsets of sensitive, intrinsic tolerant, evolved tolerant and resistant. Remarkably, their dynamic shifts with evolution are depicted and spectral markers of each state are identified. Genotypic analysis validates the phenotypic shift and provides insights into the underlying genetic basis. The new platform advances rapid phenotyping resistance evolution and guides evolution control.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Fabrication of a Continuous ZIF&#8208;67 Membrane for Efficient Azeotropic Organic Solvent Mixture Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azeotropic organic solvent mixture separation is common in the chemical industry but extremely difficult. Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) shows great potential in organic solvent mixture separation due to its rigid micropores and excellent stability. However, due to the fast nucleation rate, it is a great challenge to prepare continuous ZIF&#8208;67 membrane layers with ultrathin thickness. In this study, a hydroxy salt layer with high inducible activity was synthesized as a precursor on different porous substrates to prepare ZIF&#8208;67 membranes at room temperature. The precursor layer enables an intact ZIF&#8208;67 membrane with an ultrathin thickness of 176 &#177; 12 nm. The experimental and simulation results confirmed that the size sieving through the pore windows and the preferential adsorption of polar solvent molecules provide the ZIF&#8208;67 membrane an unprecedented separation performance such as high separation factors and fluxes, for four types of azeotropic organic solvent mixtures.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental Determination of an Isolated trans&#8208;Dinitrosyl Manganese(II) Heme Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lack of direct proof in either natural or synthetic systems for trans dinitrosyl hemes, a key intermediate in the reactions of heme proteins (e.g. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), cytochrome c&#8217; and So H&#8208;NOX) with nitric oxide (NO), has hampered understanding on the exact reaction mechanisms, e.g. the formation of the five&#8208;coordinate heme complex with NO at the proximal side (5c NOP). In this work, we report the first isolation of the dinitrosyl metalloporphyrin complex, a six&#8208;coordinate, low spin {MnNO}7 species [Mn(TPP)(NO)2] (TPP2&#8210; = meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin dianion). The complex shows distinct features such as the elongated axial bond (1.877(9) vs. 1.641(5) &#197;), higher NO stretching bond position (1760 vs. 1735 cm&#8210;1) and isotropic resonance at g = 2.0, sharp contrast to those of five&#8208;coordinate mono&#8208;nitrosyl analogs. In situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFT) and EPR studies which gave deep insights into the reaction processes exhibits different responds of porphyrinates to NO.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Emerging Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vastness of organic synthetic strategies and knowledge of reticular chemistry have made covalent organic frameworks (COFs) one of the most chemically and structurally diverse class of material with potential applications ranging from gas storage, molecular separation, and catalysis to energy storage and magnetism. Recently, this class of porous material has garnered increasing interest as potential nonlinear optical (NLO) material. Traditionally, inorganic crystals, small molecule organic chromophores, and oligomers have been studied for their NLO response. Nevertheless, COFs offer significant advantages over existing NLO materials in terms of higher mechanical strength, thermo&#8208;chemical stability, and extended conjugation. Herein, we have discussed the crucial aspects, terminology, and measurement techniques related to NLO, followed by a critical analysis of the designing principles that lead to COFs with NLO response. Further, we touched on selected potential applications of these NLO materials. In the end, we presented a dedicated outlook section, wherein the future prospects and challenges of COFs as NLO material have been discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Enhancement of Charge Transport via the Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermolecular charge transport is one of the essential modes for modulation of charge transport in molecular electronic devices. Supermolecules are highly promising candidates for molecular devices due to their abundant structures and easy functionalization. Herein, we report an efficient strategy to enhance the charge transport through the pillar[5]arene self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) by introducing cationic guests. The current density of pillar[5]arene SAMs can be raised up to ~2.1 orders of magnitude by inserting cationic molecules into the cavity of pillar[5]arene in SAMs. Importantly, we have also observed a positive correlation between the charge transport of pillar[5]arene&#8208;based complex SAMs and the binding affinities of the pillar[5]arene&#8208;based complexation. Such enhancement of charge transport is attributed to the efficient host&#8208;guest interactions that stabilize the supramolecular complexes and lower the energy gaps for charge transport. This work provides a predictive pattern for the regulation of intermolecular charge transport in guiding the design of next generation of switches and functional sensors in supramolecular electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of Stabilized 1T&#8208;MoS2 by Atomic&#8208;Interface Engineering of 2H&#8208;MoS2/Fe&#8208;Nx towards Enhanced Sodium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallic conductive 1T phase molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) has been identified as promising anode for sodium ion (Na+) batteries, but its metastable feature makes it difficult to obtain and its restacking during the charge/discharge processing result in part capacity reversibility. Herein, a synergetic effect of atomic&#8208;interface engineering is employed for constructing 2H&#8208;MoS2 layers assembled on single atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C (SA Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C) anode material that boosts its reversible capacity. The work&#8208;function&#8208;driven&#8208;electron transfer occurs from SA Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C to 2H&#8208;MoS2 via the Fe&#8208;S bonds, which enhances the adsorption of Na+ by 2H&#8208;MoS2, and lays the foundation for the sodiation process. A phase transfer from 2H to 1T/2H MoS2 with the ferromagnetic spin&#8208;polarization of SA Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C occurs during the sodiation/desodiation process, which significantly enhances the Na+ storage kinetics, and thus the 1T/2H MoS2/SA Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C display a high electronic conductivity and a fast Na+ diffusion rate.</dc:description>

         <title>Exceptionally Stable Dimers and Trimers of Au25 Clusters Linked with a Bidentate Dithiol: Synthesis, Structure and Chirality Study.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bidentate chiral dithiol (diBINAS) is utilised to bridge Au25 nanoclusters to form oligomers. Separation by size allows the isolation of fractions that are stable thanks to the bidentate nature of the linker. The structure of the products is elucidated by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and calculated using density functional theory. Additional structural details are studied by diffusion&#8208;ordered nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. Significant changes in the optical properties are analysed by UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopies, with the latter demonstrating a strong emission enhancement. Furthermore, the emergent chiral characteristics are studied by circular dichroism. Due to the geometry constraints of the nanocluster assemblies, diBINAS can be regarded as a templating molecule, taking a step towards the directed self&#8208;assembly of metal clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Boron&#8208;Thioketonates: A New Class of S,O&#8208;Chelated Boranes as Acceptors in Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class tetra&#8208;coordinated boranes namely boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thioketonates analogues to boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonates containing a sulfur atom in the framework of &#946;&#8208;diketones, which exhibit outstanding bulk electron mobility, photoresponse and tunable luminescence.







Abstract
Development of new n&#8208;type semiconductors with tunable band gap and dielectric constant has significant implication in dissociating bound charge carrier relevant for demonstrating high performance optoelectronic devices. Boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thioketonates (MTDKB), analogues to boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonates containing a sulfur atom in the framework of &#946;&#8208;diketones were synthesized. Bulk transport measurement exhibited an outstanding bulk electron mobility of &#8776;0.003&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is among the best values reported till date in these class of semiconducting materials and correspondingly a single junction photo responsivity of upto 6&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 was obtained. This new family of O,S&#8208;chelated boron compounds exhibited luminescence in the far red/near&#8208;infrared region. The remarkable red shift of 89&#8197;nm (fluorescence) observed for 4&#8201;a in comparison with analogues boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonate signifies the importance of sulfur in these molecules. MTDKBs with amine functionality have also been investigated as an ON/OFF fluorescent sensor.

         <title>Photochemical Processes of Superbase Generation in Xanthone Carboxylic Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysics and photochemistry of XnAA&#8208;TBD photobase generator along with the rate constants of intersystem crossing and internal conversion underlying the release of TBD by a photodecarboxylation process occurring from T2 with a rate constant of 2.2&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Photobase generators are species that allow the photocatalysis of various reactions, such as thiol&#8208;Michael, thiol&#8208;isocyanate, and ring&#8208;opening polymerization reactions. However, existing compounds have complex syntheses and low quantum yields. To overcome these problems, photobase generators based on the photodecarboxylation reaction were developed. We synthesized and studied the photochemistry and photophysics of two xanthone photobase, their carboxylic acid precursors, and their photoproducts to understand the photobase generation mechanism. We determined accurate quantum yields of triplet states and photobase generation. The effect of the intermediate radical preceding the base release was demonstrated. We characterized the photophysics of the photobase by femtosecond spectroscopy and showed that the photodecarboxylation process occurred from the second excited triplet state with a rate constant of 2.2&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1.

         <title>Beyond Microporosity in Porous Organic Molecular Materials (POMMs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The level of porosity beyond the microporous regime in Porous Organic Molecular Materials (POMMs) will trigger a shift in porous materials, rendering fascinating and unique opportunities in many applications. In this minireview, we summarize the recent advances in the synthesis of meso&#8208; and/or macroporous and hierarchical POMMs, highlighting some of their current applications.







Abstract
Porous organic molecular materials (POMMs) are a novel class of porous materials that cover a wide range of organic&#8208;based molecular building blocks connected through weak supramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. Despite of their diverse chemical and structural nature, common features to POMMs include solution processability, crystallinity and microporosity. Herein, we focus, for the first time, on the advance of the field of POMMs beyond the archetypical microporosity. In particular, we highlight relevant examples of meso&#8208; and macroporous POMMs, as well as hierchachical ones (micro&#8208;/meso&#8208;, micro&#8208;/macro&#8208; and meso&#8208;/macroporous). We also remark some of their unique properties, and how they can be key in many applications.

         <title>Discovery of Potent and Exquisitely Selective Inhibitors of Kinase CK1 with Tunable Isoform Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Newly identified chemical biology probes MU1250, MU1500, and MU1742, based on the 1H&#8208;pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine&#8208;imidazole scaffold, allow for highly specific targeting of the isoforms CK1&#945;, CK1&#948;, and CK1&#1013; in cells as well as in vivo. Our observations suggest that the central scaffold can be used more broadly in compounds targeting other protein kinases, as evidenced by the highly selective p38&#945; inhibitor MU1299.







Abstract
Casein kinases 1 (CK1) are key signaling molecules that have emerged recently as attractive therapeutic targets in particular for the treatment of hematological malignancies. Herein, we report the identification of a new class of potent and highly selective inhibitors of CK1&#945;, &#948; and &#1013;. Based on their optimal in vitro and in vivo profiles and their exclusive selectivity, MU1250, MU1500 and MU1742 were selected as quality chemical probes for those CK1 isoforms. At proper concentrations, MU1250 and MU1500 allow for specific targeting of CK1&#948; or dual inhibition of CK1&#948;/&#1013; in cells. The compound MU1742 also efficiently inhibits CK1&#945; and, to our knowledge, represents the first potent and highly selective inhibitor of this enzyme. In addition, we demonstrate that the central 1H&#8208;pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine&#8208;imidazole pharmacophore can be used as the basis of highly selective inhibitors of other therapeutically relevant protein kinases, e.g. p38&#945;, as exemplified by the compound MU1299.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of [Fe3(As3)3(As4)]3&#8722;, a Binary Fe/As Zintl Cluster With an Fe3 Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binary iron arsenide cluster, [Fe3(As3)3(As4)]3&#8722;, contains a triangular Fe3 core with short Fe&#8722;Fe bonds.







Abstract
We report here the synthesis and structural characterization of the first binary iron arsenide cluster anion, [Fe3(As3)3(As4)]3&#8722;, present in both [K([2.2.2]crypt)]3[Fe3(As3)3(As4)] (1) and [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]3[Fe3(As3)3(As4)]&#8901;en (2). The cluster contains an Fe3 triangle with three short Fe&#8722;Fe bond lengths (2.494(1)&#8197;&#197;, 2.459(1)&#8197;&#197; and 2.668(2)&#8197;&#197; for 1, 2.471(1)&#8197;&#197;, 2.473(1)&#8197;&#197; and 2.660(1)&#8197;&#197; for 2), bridged by a 2&#8208;butene&#8208;like As4 unit. An analysis of the electronic structure using DFT reveals a triplet ground state with direct Fe&#8722;Fe bonds stabilizing the Fe3 core.

&lt;p&gt;We report here the synthesis and structural characterization of the first binary iron arsenide cluster anion, [Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(As&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, present in both [K([2.2.2]crypt)]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(As&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and [K(18&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;crown&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;6)]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(As&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;i&gt;&#8901;&lt;/i&gt;en (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). The cluster contains an Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; triangle with three short Fe&#8722;Fe bond lengths (2.494(1)&#8197;&#197;, 2.459(1)&#8197;&#197; and 2.668(2)&#8197;&#197; for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, 2.471(1)&#8197;&#197;, 2.473(1)&#8197;&#197; and 2.660(1)&#8197;&#197; for &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), bridged by a 2-butene-like As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; unit. An analysis of the electronic structure using DFT reveals a triplet ground state with direct Fe&#8722;Fe bonds stabilizing the Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; core.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemomechanically Stable Small Single&#8208;crystal Mo&#8208;doped LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 Cathodes for Practical 4.5&#8197;V&#8208;class Pouch&#8208;type Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Small single&#8208;crystal Mo&#8208;doped LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 with high chemomechanical reliability is constructed, and exhibits high&#8208;rate capacities, long&#8208;duration life, and low thermal activity under highly delithiated states for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;tolerance Li&#8208;ion batteries as competitive cathodes.







Abstract
High voltage can cost&#8208;effectively boost energy density of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes based Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but compromises their mechanical, electrochemical and thermal&#8208;driven stability. Herein, a collaborative strategy (i.e., small single&#8208;crystal design and hetero&#8208;atom doping) is devised to construct a chemomechanically reliable small single&#8208;crystal Mo&#8208;doped LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (SS&#8208;MN6) operating stably under high voltage (&#8805;4.5&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+). The substantially reduced particle size combined with Mo6+ doping absorbs accumulated localized stress to eradicate cracks formation, subdues the surface side reactions and lattice oxygen missing meanwhile, and improves thermal tolerance at highly delithiated state. Consequently, the SS&#8208;MN6 based pouch cells are endowed with striking deep cycling stability and wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;tolerance capability. The contribution here provides a promising way to construct advanced cathodes with superb chemomechanical stability for next&#8208;generation LIBs.

         <title>Mass Spectrometry Reveals High Levels of Hydrogen Peroxide in Pancreatic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using mass spectrometry and biological techniques, we found that H2O2 is dysregulated in PDAC, further validating that the main reasons for H2O2 enrichment in PDAC cells may be that oncogenic KRAS mutation promoted H2O2 production and silenced CAT levels in PDAC. Furthermore, we identified that H2O2 affects the cells&#8217; metabolic profile and promotes the survival of PDAC cells.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical for many cellular functions, and dysregulation of ROS involves the development of multiple types of tumors, including pancreatic cancer. However, ROS have been grouped into a single biochemical entity for a long time, and the specific roles of certain types of ROS in tumor cells (e.g., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)) have not been systematically investigated. In this work, a highly sensitive and accurate mass spectrometry&#8208;based method was applied to study PDAC cells of humans and of genetically modified animals. The results show that the oncogenic KRAS mutation promotes the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) rather than superoxide or hydroxyl radicals in pancreatic cancer cells. We further identified that the enriched H2O2 modifies cellular metabolites and promotes the survival of pancreatic cancer cells. These findings highlight the specific roles of H2O2 in pancreatic cancer development, which may provide new directions for pancreatic cancer therapy.

         <title>Stress&#8208;Induced Inversion of Linear Dichroism by 4,4&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine Rotation in a Superelastic Organic Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine molecule in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded molecular trimer can be rotated 90&#176; around the hydrogen bonds, leading to a single&#8208;crystal superelastic deformation associated with a reversible inversion of linear dichroism spectra.







Abstract
The molecular crystals that manifest unusual mechanical properties have attracted growing attention. Herein, we prepared an organic single crystal that shows bidirectional superelastic transformation in response to shear stress. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions revealed this crystal&#8208;twinning related shape change is owed to a stress&#8208;controlled 90&#176; rotation of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine around the hydrogen bonds of a chiral organic trimer. As a consequence of the 90&#176; shift in the aromatic plane, an interconversion of crystallographic a&#8208;, b&#8208;axes (a&#8594;b&#8242; and b&#8594;a&#8242;) was detected. The molecular rotations changed the anisotropic absorption of linearly polarized light. Therefore, a stress&#8208;induced inversion of linear dichroism spectra was demonstrated for the first time. This study reveals the superior mechanical flexibilities of single crystals can be realized by harnessing the molecular rotations and this superelastic crystal may find applications in optical switching and communications.

         <title>Concerted and Selective Electrooxidation of Polyethylene&#8208;Terephthalate&#8208;Derived Alcohol to Glycolic Acid at an Industry&#8208;Level Current Density over a Pd&#8722;Ni(OH)2 Catalyst</title>

         <dc:description>
Concerted and selective electro&#8208;reforming of PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol into high&#8208;value glycolic acid and H2 fuel was achieved at an industry&#8208;level current density (600&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.15&#8197;V vs. RHE) by a Pd&#8722;Ni(OH)2 catalyst. Notably, stable electrolysis over 200&#8197;h can be achieved in a flow electrolyzer, outperforming all available Pd&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Electro&#8208;reforming of Polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate&#8208;derived (PET&#8208;derived) ethylene glycol (EG) into fine chemicals and H2 is an ideal solution to address severe plastic pollution. Here, we report the electrooxidation of EG to glycolic acid (GA) with a high Faraday efficiency and selectivity (&gt;85&#8201;%) even at an industry&#8208;level current density (600&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.15&#8197;V vs. RHE) over a Pd&#8722;Ni(OH)2 catalyst. Notably, stable electrolysis over 200&#8197;h can be achieved, outperforming all available Pd&#8208;based catalysts. Combined experimental and theoretical results reveal that 1)&#8197;the OH* generation promoted by Ni(OH)2 plays a critical role in facilitating EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA oxidation and removing poisonous carbonyl species, thereby achieving high activity and stability; 2)&#8197;Pd with a downshifted d&#8208;band center and the oxophilic Ni can synergistically facilitate the rapid desorption and transfer of GA from the active Pd sites to the inactive Ni sites, avoiding over&#8208;oxidation and thus achieving high selectivity.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Conductive Supramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Superstructures for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic superstructures are designed, which empower high&#8208;kinetics Grotthuss proton conduction to deeply access build&#8208;in protophilic oxygen motifs via a two&#8208;step nine&#8208;electron (de)coordination reaction, endowing the assembled Zn&#8208;organic battery ultrahigh energy density, superior rate capacity and ultra&#8208;stable cyclability.







Abstract
With fast (de)coordination kinetics, the smallest and the lightest proton stands out as the most ideal charge carrier for aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). Hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks with rapid Grotthuss proton conduction is particularly suitable for organic cathodes, yet not reported. We report the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of cyanuric acid and 1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triamine into organic superstructures through in&#8208;plane H&#8208;bonds and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction. The supramolecular superstructures exhibit highly stable lock&#8208;and&#8208;key H&#8208;bonding networks with an ultralow activation energy for protonation (0.09&#8197;eV vs. 0.25&#8197;eV of zincification). Then, high&#8208;kinetics H+ coordination is prior to Zn2+ into protophilic C=O sites via a two&#8208;step nine&#8208;electron reaction. The assembled ZOBs show high&#8208;rate capability (135&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 150&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), high energy density (267&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1cathode) and ultra&#8208;long life (50&#8201;000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), becoming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZOBs in comprehensive performances.

         <title>Polar Phosphorus Chalcogenide Cage Molecules: Enhancement of Nonlinear Optical Properties in Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polar phosphorus chalcogenide cages (&#946;&#8208;P4S3, &#946;&#8208;P4S4, &#946;&#8208;P4Se3, &#946;&#8208;P4Se4) with strong hyperpolarizabilities as functional molecules are introduced into inorganic adducts, resulting in four high&#8208;performance IR nonlinear optical materials. Among them, (CuBr)7(P4Se3)3 exhibits the largest second harmonic generation response (3.5&#215;AGS @ 2&#8197;&#956;m) in inorganic adducts.







Abstract
Inorganic adducts are an emerging class of infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, although the reported NLO adducts have sufficient birefringences and significant laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LIDTs), they commonly suffer from weak second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. In this work, a series of polar phosphorus chalcogenide cage molecules with strong hyperpolarizabilities were theoretically screened out to enhance the SHG responses of adducts. Accordingly, (CuI)3(P4S4), (CuI)3(P4Se4), (CuBr)7(P4S3)3 and (CuBr)7(P4Se3)3 with target polar cage molecules were successfully synthesized. As expected, they exhibit enhanced SHG responses while keeping moderate birefringences and high LIDTs. Notably, (CuBr)7(P4Se3)3 possesses the largest SHG response (3.5&#215;AGS@2.05&#8197;&#956;m) among the known inorganic NLO adducts. Our study confirms that introducing NLO&#8208;active cage molecules into adducts is an efficient strategy for high&#8208;performance NLO materials.

         <title>Pyridine Dimers and Their Low&#8208;Temperature Isomerization: A High&#8208;Resolution Matrix&#8208;Isolation Spectroscopy Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution IR spectra in Ne matrices in alliance with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations give evidence for a hydrogen&#8208;bonded structure as lowest&#8208;energy form of the pyridine dimer.







Abstract
The bonding between two neutral aromatic compounds, especially small ones, has been controversially debated in the last decades, and terms like &#8220;&#960;&#8208;stacking&#8221; had to be revised. Surprisingly, despite of many experimental and computational work, there is still no clear consensus about the structure of and the bonding in the pyridine dimer. In this work, for different isomeric forms of the pyridine dimer, the structures and bonding were elucidated by combining high&#8208;resolution matrix&#8208;isolation spectroscopic results with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. High&#8208;resolution IR spectra of Ne matrices at 4&#8197;K containing pyridine were recorded for different concentrations and upon annealing to 10 and 12&#8197;K, relying on three isotopologues of pyridine. The spectra show the presence of hydrogen&#8208;bonded, T&#8208;shaped, and stacked forms of weakly&#8208;bound pyridine dimers. Among these, the hydrogen&#8208;bonded isomer is identified as the lowest&#8208;energy form. The results provide for the first time conclusive information about the interaction between two pyridine dimers.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Molecule&#8208;Regulated Core&#8208;Shell&#8208;Solvation Electrolyte for Li&#8208;Metal Batteries at Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries hold great promise for promoting energy density and operating at low temperatures, yet they still suffer from insufficient Li compatibility and slow kinetic, especially at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. Herein, we rationally design and synthesize a new amphiphilic solvent, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;3&#8208;methoxypropane, for use in battery electrolytes. The lithiophilic segment is readily to solvate Li+ to induce self&#8208;assembly of the electrolyte solution to form a peculiar core&#8208;shell&#8208;solvation structure. Such unique solvation structure not only largely improves the ionic conductivity to allow fast Li+ transport and lower the desolvation energy to enable facile desolvation, but also leads to the formation of a highly robust and conductive inorganic SEI. The resulting electrolyte demonstrates high Li efficiency and superior cycling stability from room temperature to &#8722;40&#176;C at high current densities. Meanwhile, anode&#8208;free high&#8208;voltage cell retains 87% capacity after 100 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Biosynthesis of Mutaxanthene Unveils a Flavoprotein Monooxygenase Catalyzing Xanthene Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavoprotein monooxygenases (FPMOs) play important roles in generating structural complexity and diversity in natural products biosynthesized by type II polyketide synthases (PKSs). In this work, we use genome mining to discover novel mutaxanthene analogs and investigate the biosynthesis of these aromatic polyketides and their unusual xanthene framework. We disclosed the complete biosynthetic pathway of mutaxathene through in vivo gene deletion and in vitro biochemical experiments. We showed a multifunctional FPMO, MtxO4, catalyzes ring rearrangement and generates the required xanthene ring through multi&#8208;step transformation. In addition, we have successfully obtained all necessary enzymes for in vitro reconstitution, and total biosynthesize mutaxanthene in a step&#8208;wise manner. Our results revealed the formation of a rare xanthene ring in type II polyketide biosynthesis, and demonstrates the potential of using total biosynthesis for the discovery of natural products synthesized by type II PKSs.</dc:description>

         <title>Stacking Cyclophanes into Microcrystalline Chiral Vases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering novel micro&#8208;/nanoscale systems and devices based on the supramolecular assembly have tremendous potential from a diverse applications perspective; however, controlling the size, shape, spatial arrangements, and hierarchical transcription by a dimensional organizing principle without the help of templates remains a challenging task. In this vein, a recent study by Oki and colleagues on stacking chiral cyclophane via intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions to craft synchronous microcrystalline 3D chiral vessels with controlled conformational arrangements represents a truly remarkable illustration of molecular engineering. The microvessels bear stereocontrolled skeletal morphology, recognize stereoisomers and serve as containers to accommodate microcrystals, polymer particles, and fluorescent dyes. The full application scope of this fascinating research is far beyond non&#8208;covalent interactions, supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, and crystal engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;flammable ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) are well&#8208;known candidates for safer and long&#8208;lifespan lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the high viscosity and insufficient Li+ transport limit their practical application. Recently, non&#8208;solvating and low&#8208;viscosity co&#8208;solvents diluting ILEs without affecting the local Li+ solvation structure are employed to solve these problems. The diluted electrolytes, i.e., locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILEs), exhibiting lower viscosity, faster Li+ transport, and enhanced compatibility toward lithium metal anodes, are feasible options for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs. Herein, the progress of the recently developed LCILEs are summarised, including their physicochemical properties, solution structures, and applications in LMBs with a variety of high&#8208;energy cathode materials. Lastly, a perspective on the future research directions of LCILEs to further understanding and achieve improved cell performances is outlined.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Capsule Catalysis Enables the Exploration of Terpenoid Chemical Space Untapped by Nature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpenes represent the largest and the most diverse class of natural compounds. This is remarkable as the whole variety is accessed from just a handful of highly conserved linear precursors. Modification of the cyclization precursors would enable a dramatic expansion of the accessible chemical space. However, natural enzymes do not enable us to tap into this potential, as they do not tolerate larger deviations from the prototypical substrate structure. Here we report that supramolecular capsule catalysis enables facile access to diverse and novel terpenoid skeletons that formally can be traced back to C3&#8208;phenyl, benzyl, and homoprenyl derivatives of farnesol. Novel skeletons related to the presilphiperfolane core structure, as well as novel neoclovene derivatives were accessed efficiently in only four synthetic steps. Importantly, the products obtained carry functional groups that may be readily derivatized further. The results obtained demonstrate the potential of supramolecular catalysis for tapping into the vast chemical space of terpenoids not explored by Nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabled Efficient Ammonia Synthesis and Energy Supply in a Zinc&#8211;nitrate Battery System by Separating Nitrate Reduction Process into Two Stages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aqueous electrocatalytic reduction of NO3&#8208; into NH3 (NitrRR) presents a sustainable route applicable to NH3 production and potentially energy storage. However, the NitrRR involves a directly eight&#8208;electron transfer process generally required a large overpotential (&lt; &#8208;0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE)) to reach optimal efficiency. Here, inspired by biological nitrate respiration, the NitrRR was separated into two stages along a [2 + 6]&#8208;electron pathway to alleviate the kinetic barrier. The system employed a Cu nanowire catalyst produces NO2&#8208; and NH3 with current efficiencies of 91.5% and 100%, respectively at lower overpotentials (&gt; +0.1 vs. RHE). The high efficiency for such a reduction process was further explored in a zinc&#8208;nitrate battery. This battery could be specified by a high output voltage of 0.70 V, an average energy density of 566.7 Wh L&#8208;1 at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and a power density of 14.1 mW cm&#8208;2, which is well beyond all previously reported similar concepts.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Arylation of Cyclobutenone Ketals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complex cyclobutanes are important motifs in both bioactive molecules and natural products, yet their enantioselective preparation has not been widely explored. In this work, we describe rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective additions of aryl and vinyl boronic acids to cyclobutenone ketals. This transformation involves enantioselective carbometalation to give cyclobutyl&#8208;rhodium intermediates, followed by &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination to afford enantioenriched enol ethers. Overall, this addition serves as a surrogate for Rh&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;additions to cyclobutenone.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Metal&#8211;Quinone Networks with Tunable Architecture and Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanostructured materials with tunable structures and functionality are of interest in diverse areas. Herein, metal ions are coordinated with quinones via metal&#8211;acetylacetone coordination bonds to generate a class of structurally tunable, universally adhesive, superhydrophilic, and pH&#8208;degradable materials. A library of metal&#8211;quinone networks (MQNs) is produced from five model quinone ligands paired with nine metal ions, leading to particles, tubes, capsules, and films. Importantly, MQNs show bidirectional pH&#8208;responsive disassembly in acidic and alkaline solutions, where the quinone ligands mediate the disassembly kinetics, enabling temporal and spatial control over the release of multiple components using multilayered MQNs. Leveraging this tunable release and the inherent medicinal properties of quinones, MQN prodrugs with a high drug loading (&gt;89 wt%) are engineered using doxorubicin for anti&#8208;cancer therapy and shikonin for the inhibition of the main protease in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetranuclear Cu(II) Cluster as the Ten Node Building Unit for the Construction of a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of high nuclear copper cluster&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks has not been established yet. Herein, we report a novel MOF (FJU&#8208;112) with the ten&#8208;connected tetranuclear copper cluster [Cu4(PO3)2(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)2(CO2)4] as the node which was capped by the deprotonated organic ligand of H4L (3,5&#8208;Dicarboxyphenylphosphonic acid). With BPE (1,2&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane) as the pore partitioner, the pore spaces in the structure of FJU&#8208;112 were divided into several smaller cages and smaller windows for efficient gas adsorption and separation. FJU&#8208;112 exhibits a high separation performance for the C2H2/CO2 separation, which were established by the temperature&#8208;dependent sorption isotherms and further confirmed by the lab&#8208;scale dynamic breakthrough experiments. The grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) studies show that its high C2H2/CO2 separation performance is contributed to the strong &#960;&#8208;complexation interactions between the C2H2 molecules and framework pore surfaces, leading to its more C2H2 uptakes over CO2 molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Vanadium oxides with amorphous&#8208;crystalline heterointerface network for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;VOx batteries are attracting attention in large scale energy storage applications. Yet, the sluggish Zn2+ diffusion kinetics and ambiguous structure&#8208;property relationship are always challenging to fulfil the great potential of the batteries. Here we electrodeposit vanadium oxide nanobelts (VO&#8208;E) with highly disordered structure. The electrode achieves high capacities (e.g., ~5 mAh cm&#8208;2, 516 mAh g&#8208;1), good rate and cycling performances. Detailed structure analysis indicates VO&#8208;E is composed of integrated amorphous&#8208;crystalline nanoscale domains, forming an efficient heterointerface network in the bulk electrode, which accounts for the good electrochemical properties. Theoretical calculations indicate that the amorphous&#8208;crystalline heterostructure exhibits the favorable cation adsorption and lower ion diffusion energy barriers compared to the amorphous and crystalline counterparts, thus accelerating charge carrier mobility and electrochemical activity of the electrode.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphdiyne&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Different Coordination Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a special carbon material, graphdiyne (GDY) features the superiorities of incomplete charge transfer effect on the atomic level, tunable electronic structure and anchoring metal atoms directly with organometallic coordination bonds M (metal)&#8208;C (alkynyl carbon in GDY), providing it an ideal platform to construct single&#8208;atom catalysts (ACs). The coordination environment of single atoms anchored on GDY plays a key role in their catalytic performance. The mini&#8208;review highlights state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress in the rational design of GDY&#8208;based ACs and their applications, and mainly reveals the relationship between the coordination engineering of the GDY&#8208;based ACs and corresponding catalytic performance. Finally, some prospects concerning the future development of GDY&#8208;based ACs in energy conversion are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni(II) 3,7,13,17&#8208;tetrapyridyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;diazaporphyrin serves as a double tridentate ligand to Pd(II) ions to provide a pincer&#8208;type bispalladium complex. Electrochemical analysis revealed that the bispalladium complex shows excellent ability to accept electrons and reversible redox properties due to the coordination of the two cationic Pd(II) centers to the&#160;meso&#8208;nitrogen atoms. We isolated and characterized one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduction species of the bispalladium complex. The 20&#960; antiaromatic nature of the two&#8208;electron reduction species was confirmed by&#160;1H NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;vis&#8208;near&#8208;IR (NIR) absorption spectra, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed highly twisted structures for the bispalladium complexes regardless of the oxidation state.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Structural Origin of Fictive Temperature Revealed by AZnP3O9 (A = K, Rb) Glasses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fictive temperature (Tf) is widely applied to understand the relaxation thermodynamics of a glass; however, its atomic structural origin is still unclear. Here, we report two novel AZnP3O9 glasses obtained by melting the composition identical single crystals. These glasses exhibit structural inheritance within 5 &#197; from the single crystal counterparts that is quantified by &#948; = nglass/ncry (0 &#8804; &#948; &#8804; 1, n is the number of pair correlation functions). Among the available glass&#8208;formers, glassKZnP3O9 exhibits the highest structural inheritance (&#948; = 1, nglass = 8). More insightfully, a reverse correlation between &#948; and the relaxation thermodynamic parameters is observed in glassAZnP3O9, revealing for the first time the atomic structural origin of fictive temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;long Near&#8208;infrared Repeatable Photochemical Afterglow Mediated by Reversible Storage of Singlet Oxygen for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical afterglow systems have drawn considerable attention in recent years due to their regulable photophysical properties and charming application potential. However, conventional photochemical afterglow suffered from its unrepeatability due to the consumption of energy cache units as afterglow photons are emitted. Here we report a novel strategy to realize repeatable photochemical afterglow (RPA) through the reversible storage of 1O2 by 2&#8208;pyridones. Near&#8208;infrared afterglow with a lifetime over 10 s is achieved, and its initial intensity shows no significant reduction over 50 excitation cycles. A detailed mechanism study was conducted and confirmed the RPA is realized through the singlet oxygen&#8208;sensitized fluorescence emission. Furthermore, the generality of this strategy is demonstrated and tunable afterglow lifetimes and colors are achieved by rational design. The developed RPA is further applied for attacker&#8208;misleading information encryption, presenting a repeatable&#8208;readout.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Thermal Properties of Polymers through Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal engineering of multicomponent solids involving both small and polymeric molecules resulted in the preparation of cocrystals with melting points higher than the melting point of the pure polymer. At the same time, the high mechanical flexibility of the polymer is maintained even under harsh milling conditions, allowing the formation of toroidal nanoparticles with small inner radii and high curvatures.







Abstract
Crystal engineering has exclusively focused on the development of advanced materials based on small organic molecules. We now demonstrate how the cocrystallization of a polymer yields a material with significantly enhanced thermal stability but equivalent mechanical flexibility. Isomorphous replacement of one of the cocrystal components enables the formation of solid solutions with melting points that can be readily fine&#8208;tuned over a usefully wide temperature range. The results of this study credibly extend the scope of crystal engineering and cocrystallization from small molecules to polymers.

         <title>Revealing the Formation Mechanism and Optimizing the Synthesis Conditions of Layered Double Hydroxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of NH3 gas diffusion and in situ pH measurement provides a way to investigate the effect of the real&#8208;time change of OH&#8722; concentration on layered double hydroxide (LDH) formation. The results revealed the formation mechanism of LDHs and also guided the synthesis of a library of LDHs with desired attributes, in water at room temperature without using any additives.







Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), whose formation is strongly related to OH&#8722; concentration, have attracted significant interest in various fields. However, the effect of the real&#8208;time change of OH&#8722; concentration on LDHs&#8217; formation has not been fully explored due to the unsuitability of the existing synthesis methods for in situ characterization. Here, the deliberately designed combination of NH3 gas diffusion and in situ pH measurement provides a solution to the above problem. The obtained results revealed the formation mechanism and also guided us to synthesize a library of LDHs with the desired attributes in water at room temperature without using any additives. After evaluating their oxygen evolution reaction performance, we found that FeNi&#8208;LDH with a Fe/Ni ratio of 25/75 exhibits one of the best performances so far reported.

         <title>Metal Organic Framework Cubosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a general strategy for the synthesis of ordered metal organic framework (MOF) cubosomes with a single primitive bicontinuous structure by using polymer cubosomes as the template, and also studied their growth mechanism and kinetics as well as potential proteolysis application.







Abstract
We demonstrate a general strategy for the synthesis of ordered bicontinuous&#8208;structured metal organic frameworks (MOFs) by using polymer cubosomes (PCs) with a double primitive structure (Im
m symmetry) as the template. The filling of MOF precursors in the open channel of PCs, followed by their coordination and removal of the template, generates MOF cubosomes with a single primitive topology (Pm
m) and average mesopore diameters of 60&#8211;65&#8197;nm. Mechanism study reveals that the formation of ZIF&#8208;8 cubosomes undergoes a new MOF growth process, which involves the formation of individual MOF seeds in the template, their growth and eventual fusion into the cubosomes. Their growth kinetics follows the Avrami equation with an Avrami exponent of n=3 and a growth rate of k=1.33&#215;10&#8722;4, indicating their fast 3D heterogeneous growth mode. Serving as a bioreactor, the ZIF&#8208;8 cubosomes show high loading of trypsin enzyme, leading to a high catalytic activity in the proteolysis of bovine serum albumin.

         <title>Direct Monitoring of Li2S2 Evolution and Its Influence on the Reversible Capacities of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of operando spectral results reveal that Li2S2 undergoes chemical reactions accompanied by its electrochemical conversions during operation for the first time. The chemical reactions related to Li2S2 can increase polysulfide dissolution and Li2S generation without capacity contribution. Instead of the commonly considered Li2S, Li2S2 is the solid &#8220;dead&#8221; sulfur species and restricts the actual sulfur utilization and reversible capacity.







Abstract
The polysulfide (PS) dissolution and low conductivity of lithium sulfides (Li2S) are generally considered the main reasons for limiting the reversible capacity of the lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) system. However, as the inevitable intermediate between PSs and Li2S, lithium disulfide (Li2S2) evolutions are always overlooked. Herein, Li2S2 evolutions are monitored from the operando measurements on the pouch cell level. Results indicate that Li2S2 undergoes slow electrochemical reduction and chemical disproportionation simultaneously during the discharging process, leading to further PS dissolution and Li2S generation without capacity contribution. Compared with the fully oxidized Li2S, Li2S2 still residues at the end of the charging state. Therefore, instead of the considered Li2S and PSs, slow electrochemical conversions and side chemical reactions of Li2S2 are the determining factors in limiting the sulfur utilization, corresponding to the poor reversible capacity of Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Low Concentration Sulfolane&#8208;Based Electrolyte for High Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a low concentration electrolyte (LCE) (0.25&#8197;M) with low solubility LiNO3 as the main salt. This LCE shows good separator wettability, high ionic conductivity, high Li+ transference number, and low cost. The rational design of the interphases enables LCE to be suitable for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Electrolyte engineering is crucial for the commercialization of lithium metal batteries. Here, lithium metal is stabilized in the highly reactive sulfolane&#8208;based electrolyte under low concentration (0.25&#8197;M) for the first time. Inorganic&#8208;polymer hybrid solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with high ionic conductivity, low bonding with lithium and high flexibility enables dense chunky lithium deposition and high plating/stripping efficiency. Low concentration electrolyte (LCE) also enables excellent cycling stability of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523)/Li cells at 1&#8197;C (90.7&#8201;% retention after 500&#8197;cycles) and 0.3&#8197;C (83.3&#8201;% retention after 1000&#8197;cycles). With a low N/P ratio (&#8776;2), the capacity retention for NCM523/Li cells can achieve 94.3&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.3&#8197;C. Exploring the LCE is of paramount significance because it provides more possibilities of the lithium salt selections, especially reviving some lithium salts that are excluded before due to their low solubility. More importantly, LCE has the significant advantage of commercialization due to its cost&#8208;effectiveness.

         <title>Turning on the Antimicrobial Activity of Gold Nanoclusters Against Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria
</title>

&#8220;Turning&#8208;on&#8221; the antimicrobial activity of gold nanoclusters. The addition of thiourea enabled the broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity of otherwise inactive gold nanoclusters against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria.







Abstract
In this work, we show that the addition of thiourea (TU) initiated broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity of otherwise inactive D&#8208;maltose&#8208;capped gold nanoclusters (AuNC&#8208;Mal). For example, AuNC&#8208;Mal/TU was effective against multidrug&#8208;resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 (2.5&#8197;&#956;M [Au]) while having 30&#8211;60&#8197;times lower in vitro cytotoxicity against mammalian cells. The reaction of AuNC&#8208;Mal and TU generated the antimicrobial species of [Au(TU)2]+ and smaller AuNCs. TU increased the accumulation of Au in bacteria and helped maintain the oxidation state as AuI (vs. AuIII). The modes of action included the inhibition of thioredoxin reductase, interference with the CuI regulation and depletion of ATP. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity did not change in the presence of colistin or carbonyl cyanide 3&#8208;chlorophenylhydrazone, suggesting that AuNC&#8208;Mal/TU was indifferent to the outer membrane barrier and to bacterial efflux pumps.

         <title>Enantioselective N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Oxidative Coupling of Enals with Carboxylic Acids Using an Iodine(III) Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Umpolung of an NHC&#8208;bound enolate with an iodine(III) reagent was developed to enable enantioselective &#945;&#8208;oxidative coupling of enals with carboxylic acids, affording &#945;&#8208;acyloxyl&#8208;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated esters in good yields with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The key step involves the formation of an enol iodine(III) intermediate, which changes the polarity of &#945;&#8208;carbon of the enal from nucleophilic to electrophilic.







Abstract
The enantioselective &#945;&#8208;oxidative coupling of enals with carboxylic acids was developed via the umpolung of an NHC&#8208;bound enolate with an iodine(III) reagent. The corresponding &#945;&#8208;acyloxyl&#8208;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated esters were afforded in good yields, with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The key step of the reaction involves the formation of enol iodine(III) intermediate from the enolate with iodosobenzene, which changes the polarity of &#945;&#8208;carbon of the enal from nucleophilic to electrophilic, and thus facilitates the subsequent addition of carboxylate.

         <title>Second Sphere Effects Promote Formic Acid Dehydrogenation by a Single&#8208;Atom Gold Catalyst Supported on Amino&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold (Au) single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) supported on amino&#8208;functionalized graphdiyne was synthesized, which displayed a fivefold higher catalytic activity than the Au SAC supported on graphdiyne. Experimental and computational studies reveal that the amino groups in the second sphere of the Au atom serve as proton relays to facilitate the H2 formation from an Au&#8722;H intermediate, thus substantially accelerating the rate of formic acid dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Regulating the second sphere of homogeneous molecular catalysts is a common and effective method to boost their catalytic activities, while the second sphere effects have rarely been investigated for heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalysts primarily due to the synthetic challenge for installing functional groups in their second spheres. Benefiting from the well&#8208;defined and readily tailorable structure of graphdiyne (GDY), an Au single&#8208;atom catalyst on amino&#8208;substituted GDY is constructed, where the amino group is located in the second sphere of the Au center. The Au atoms on amino&#8208;decorated GDY displayed superior activity for formic acid dehydrogenation compared with those on unfunctionalized GDY. The experimental studies, particularly the proton inventory studies, and theoretical calculations revealed that the amino groups adjacent to an Au atom could serve as proton relays and thus facilitate the protonation of an intermediate Au&#8722;H to generate H2. Our study paves the way to precisely constructing the functional second sphere on single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Highly Effective Hybrid Copper(I) Iodide Cluster Emitter with Negative Thermal Quenched Phosphorescence for X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new hybrid copper(I) iodide cluster (DBA)4Cu4I4 enables ultra&#8208;bright triplet yellow&#8208;orange emission with a PLQY&gt;94.9&#8201;% by the coaction of excited state structure reorganization and the metallophilicity interaction, and the phonon&#8208;assisted de&#8208;trapping process of exciton induces the negative thermal quenching effect at 80&#8211;300&#8197;K. Our investigation show that this material has a great potential in practical X&#8208;ray imaging applications.







Abstract
The low efficiency triplet emission of hybrid copper(I) iodide clusters is a critical obstacle to their further practical optoelectronic application. Herein, we present an efficient hybrid copper(I) iodide cluster emitter (DBA)4Cu4I4, where the cooperation of excited state structure reorganization and the metallophilicity interaction enables ultra&#8208;bright triplet yellow&#8208;orange emission with a photoluminescence quantum yield over 94.9&#8201;%, and the phonon&#8208;assisted de&#8208;trapping process of exciton induces the negative thermal quenching effect at 80&#8211;300&#8197;K. We also investigate the potential of this emitter for X&#8208;ray imaging. The (DBA)4Cu4I4 wafer demonstrates a light yield higher than 104&#8197;photons&#8201;MeV&#8722;1 and a high spatial resolution of &#8776;5.0&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1, showing great potential in practical X&#8208;ray imaging applications. Our new copper(I) iodide cluster emitter can serve as a model for investigating the thermodynamic mechanism of photoluminescence in hybrid copper(I) halide phosphorescence materials.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Bioactive Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein chemistry has evolved remarkably in the past decade, which has enabled the effective production of new molecules with novel physicochemical properties for biomedical research, and therapeutic applications. This minireview summarizes recent developments in chemical protein synthesis to produce bioactive proteins, with emphasis on novel analogs with promising in vitro and in vivo activity.







Abstract
Nature has developed a plethora of protein machinery to operate and maintain nearly every task of cellular life. These processes are tightly regulated via post&#8208;expression modifications&#8212;transformations that modulate intracellular protein synthesis, folding, and activation. Methods to prepare homogeneously and precisely modified proteins are essential to probe their function and design new bioactive modalities. Synthetic chemistry has contributed remarkably to protein science by allowing the preparation of novel biomacromolecules that are often challenging or impractical to prepare via common biological means. The ability to chemically build and precisely modify proteins has enabled the production of new molecules with novel physicochemical properties and programmed activity for biomedical research, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications. This minireview summarizes recent developments in chemical protein synthesis to produce bioactive proteins, with emphasis on novel analogs with promising in vitro and in vivo activity.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Constructing A Heterogeneous Layer on Lithium Metal Anodes for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Deposition and High Li&#8208;ion Flux</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dense and heterogeneous artificial SEI film is constructed via in situ reaction of layered zinc silicate nanosheets with Li. The consecutive Li+&#8208;conductors promote the desolvation process of solvated&#8208;Li+ and regulate the transfer of lithium ions. The nonconsecutive lithiophilic metals are polarized by the internal electric field to boost the transfer of Li+, and lower the nucleation barrier.







Abstract
Constructing efficient artificial solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film is extremely vital for the practical application of lithium metal batteries. Herein, a dense artificial SEI film, in which lithiophilic Zn/LixZny are uniformly but nonconsecutively dispersed in the consecutive Li+&#8208;conductors of LixSiOy, Li2O and LiOH, is constructed via the in situ reaction of layered zinc silicate nanosheets and Li. The consecutive Li+&#8208;conductors can promote the desolvation process of solvated&#8208;Li+ and regulate the transfer of lithium ions. The nonconsecutive lithiophilic metals are polarized by the internal electric field to boost the transfer of lithium ions, and lower the nucleation barrier. Therefore, a low polarization of &#8776;50&#8197;mV for 750&#8197;h at 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells, and a high capacity retention of 99.2&#8201;% in full cells with a high lithium iron phosphate areal loading of &#8776;13&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 are achieved. This work offers new sights to develop advanced alkali metal anodes for efficient energy storage.

         <title>Boosting Hydrogen Production via Selective Two&#8208;electron Mild Electrochemical Oxidation of Tetrahydroisoquinolines Completely to Dihydroisoquinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective two&#8208;electron mild electrochemical oxidation of tetrahydroisoquinolines to high&#8208;valued&#8208;added dihydroisoquinolines can promote hydrogen production with maximum efficiency, compared with the high energy consumption of four&#8208;electron deep oxidation to isoquinolines.







Abstract
Different from the previous study that biomass derivatives replace water oxidation for enhancing hydrogen production, we found that mild oxidation was more conductive to cathodic hydrogen production. In this study, maximum Faradaic efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) and lower energy consumption for hydrogen production was achieved by precisely controlling the two&#8208;electron mild electrochemical oxidation of tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) to dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs) in place of the four&#8208;electron deep oxidation to isoquinolines (IQs). Moreover, the high value&#8208;added DHIQs were prepared from THIQs with high selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%) at the low potential of 1.36&#8197;V. Operando electrochemical Raman and density functional theory proved that the high selectivity was attributed to the regulable active species of NiOOH induced by the interaction of Co and Fe for preferentially breaking C&#8722;H bond rather than N&#8722;H of THIQs. This novel method provides important insight into efficient biomass&#8208;assisted hydrogen production.

         <title>Enhanced Interfacial Electron Transfer by Asymmetric Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In Sites on In2O3 for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In sites constructed on Cu&#8208;In2O3/Ov catalysts facilitate the PMS adsorption and faster electron transfer through the side&#8208;on adsorption of the O&#8722;O bond, thereby realizing efficient PMS activation to generate more SO4&#8901;&#8722; and &#8901;OH rapidly, and enabling excellent degradation activity of refractory organic pollutants.







Abstract
Enhancing the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation efficiency to generate more radicals is vital to promote the Fenton&#8208;like reaction activity, however, how to promote the PMS adsorption and accelerate the interfacial electron transfer to boost its activation kinetics remains a great challenge. Herein, we prepared Cu&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich In2O3 (Cu&#8208;In2O3/Ov) catalysts containing asymmetric Cu&#8722;Ov&#8722;In sites for PMS activation in water purification. The intrinsic catalytic activity is that the side&#8208;on adsorption configuration of the O&#8722;O bond (Cu&#8722;O&#8722;O&#8722;In) at the Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In sites significantly stretches the O&#8722;O bond length. Meanwhile, the Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In sites increase the electron density near the Fermi energy level, promoting more and faster electron transfer to the O&#8722;O bond for generating more SO4&#8901;&#8722; and &#8901;OH. The degradation rate constant of tetracycline achieved by Cu&#8208;In2O3/Ov is 31.8&#8197;times faster than In2O3/Ov, and it shows the possibility of membrane reactor for practical wastewater treatment.

         <title>Electrocrystallization Regulation Enabled Stacked Hexagonal Platelet Growth toward Highly Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A control mechanism of electrolyte on zinc electrocrystallization is proposed and validated through cyclic and linear sulfone cosolvents. The inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) formed by vertical dipole array is able to convert the deposition into activation control by weakening the solvated ion adsorption at the interface, steering conformal stratiform Zn growth and preferred orientation of Zn electrocrystallization.







Abstract
Realizing durative flattened and dendrite&#8208;free zinc (Zn) metal configuration is the key to resolving premature battery failure caused by the internal short circuit, which is highly determined by the crystal growth in the electrocrystallization process. Herein, we report that regulating the molecular structure of the inner Helmholtz plane (HIP) can effectively convert the deposition into activation control by weakening the solvated ion adsorption at the interface. The moderated electrochemical reaction kinetics lower than the adatom self&#8208;diffusion rate steers conformal stratiform Zn growth and dominant Zn (0001) texture, achieving crystallographic optimization. Through in situ mediation of electrolyte engineering, orientational plating and stripping behaviors at edge&#8208;sites and tailored solvation structure immensely improve the utilization efficiency and total charge passed of Zn metal, even under extreme conditions, including high areal capacity (3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and wide temperature range (&#8722;40&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Electrooxidative Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H Annulation with Alkenes</title>

Reported is the first electrooxidative cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H annulation with olefins (up to 99&#8201;% ee) using tBu&#8208;Salox as chiral ligand. The cooperative effect between tBu&#8208;Salox and 3,4,5&#8208;trichloropyridine enabled the highly enantio&#8208; and regioselective C&#8722;H annulation with the more challenging &#945;&#8208;olefins (up to 96&#8201;% ee and 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 rr). Mechanistic studies provided insights into the mechanism of this reaction.







Abstract
In recent years, the merging of electrosynthesis with 3d metal catalyzed C&#8722;H activation has emerged as a sustainable and powerful technique in organic synthesis. Despite the impressive advantages, the development of an enantioselective version remains elusive and poses a daunting challenge. Herein, we report the first electrooxidative cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208; and regioselective C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H annulation with olefins using an undivided cell at room temperature (up to 99&#8201;% ee). tBu&#8208;Salox, a rationally designed Salox ligand bearing a bulky tert&#8208;butyl group at the ortho&#8208;position of phenol, was found to be crucial for this asymmetric annulation reaction. A strong cooperative effect between tBu&#8208;Salox and 3,4,5&#8208;trichloropyridine enabled the highly enantio&#8208; and regioselective C&#8722;H annulation with the more challenging &#945;&#8208;olefins without secondary bond interactions (up to 96&#8201;% ee and 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 rr). Cyclovoltametric studies, and the preparation, characterization, and transformation of cobaltacycle intermediates shed light on the mechanism of this reaction.

&lt;/sup&gt;Bu-Salox and 3,4,5-trichloropyridine enabled the highly enantio- and regioselective C&#8722;H annulation with the more challenging &#945;-olefins (up to 96&#8201;% ee and 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 rr). Mechanistic studies provided insights into the mechanism of this reaction.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the merging of electrosynthesis with 3d metal catalyzed C&#8722;H activation has emerged as a sustainable and powerful technique in organic synthesis. Despite the impressive advantages, the development of an enantioselective version remains elusive and poses a daunting challenge. Herein, we report the first electrooxidative cobalt-catalyzed enantio- and regioselective C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H annulation with olefins using an undivided cell at room temperature (up to 99&#8201;% ee). &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu-Salox, a rationally designed Salox ligand bearing a bulky &lt;i&gt;tert-&lt;/i&gt;butyl group at the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-position of phenol, was found to be crucial for this asymmetric annulation reaction. A strong cooperative effect between &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu-Salox and 3,4,5-trichloropyridine enabled the highly enantio- and regioselective C&#8722;H annulation with the more challenging &#945;-olefins without secondary bond interactions (up to 96&#8201;% ee and 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 rr). Cyclovoltametric studies, and the preparation, characterization, and transformation of cobaltacycle intermediates shed light on the mechanism of this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Probe of Electrochemical Pseudocapacitive pH Jump at a Graphene Electrode
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using surface&#8208;specific heterodyne&#8208;detected sum&#8208;frequency generation, we probe the structure and orientation of interfacial water at a graphene electrode and find phase transition&#8208;like changes. We attribute it to local pH change&#8208;induced pseudocapacitive charging/discharging of the CaF2 substrate of the graphene electrode. Our work evidences the molecular&#8208;level effects of pseudocapacitive charging at an electrode/aqueous electrolyte interface.







Abstract
Molecular&#8208;level insight into interfacial water at a buried electrode interface is essential in electrochemistry, but spectroscopic probing of the interface remains challenging. Here, using surface&#8208;specific heterodyne&#8208;detected sum&#8208;frequency generation (HD&#8208;SFG) spectroscopy, we directly access the interfacial water in contact with the graphene electrode supported on calcium fluoride (CaF2). We find phase transition&#8208;like variations of the HD&#8208;SFG spectra vs. applied potentials, which arises not from the charging/discharging of graphene but from the charging/discharging of the CaF2 substrate through the pseudocapacitive process. The potential&#8208;dependent spectra are nearly identical to the pH&#8208;dependent spectra, evidencing that the pseudocapacitive behavior is associated with a substantial local pH change induced by water dissociation between the CaF2 and graphene. Our work evidences the local molecular&#8208;level effects of pseudocapacitive charging at an electrode/aqueous electrolyte interface.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Far&#8208;Red Light&#8208;Driven Photolysis via Triplet Fusion to Enhance Checkpoint Blockade Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free triplet fusion photolysis (TFP) system, consisting of a BODIPY photosensitizer and a perylene prodrug (PyCl), released an anti&#8208;cancer drug upon far&#8208;red light irradiation. Encapsulation of this TFP system and a 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor within a nanoparticle enabled far&#8208;red light&#8208;promoted checkpoint blockade immunotherapy for effective inhibition of both local and metastatic tumors under extremely low excitation (20&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven prodrug photoactivation is highly desirable for applications such as neuromodulation, drug delivery, and cancer therapy. Herein, via triplet fusion, we report on the far&#8208;red light&#8208;driven photo&#8208;release of an anti&#8208;cancer drug by coupling the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based photosensitizer with a photocleavable perylene&#8208;based anti&#8208;cancer drug. Notably, this metal&#8208;free triplet fusion photolysis (TFP) strategy can be further advanced by incorporating an additional functional dopant, i.e. an immunotherapy medicine inhibiting the indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO), with the far&#8208;red responsive triplet fusion pair in an air&#8208;stable nanoparticle. With this IDO inhibitor&#8208;assisted TFP system we observed efficient inhibition of primary and distant tumors in a mouse model at record&#8208;low excitation power, compared to other photo&#8208;assisted immunotherapy approaches. This metal&#8208;free TFP strategy will spur advancement in photonics and biophotonics fields.

         <title>Substantial Improvement of an Epimerase for the Synthesis of D&#8208;Allulose by Biosensor&#8208;Based High&#8208;Throughput Microdroplet Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modified D&#8208;allulose biosensor was combined with a microdroplet screening system to establish an ultrahigh&#8208;throughput screening strategy. Structure&#8208;guided rational design and directed evolution were conducted to remodel the SfDAE active pocket and its lid region for enhanced catalytic performance for the synthesis of D&#8208;allulose. This approach shows great potential for the design and optimization of biosensor&#8208;based microdroplet screening platforms.







Abstract
Biosynthesis of D&#8208;allulose has been achieved using ketose 3&#8208;epimerases (KEases), but its application is limited by poor catalytic performance. In this study, we redesigned a genetically encoded biosensor based on a D&#8208;allulose&#8208;responsive transcriptional regulator for real&#8208;time monitoring of D&#8208;allulose. An ultrahigh&#8208;throughput droplet&#8208;based microfluidic screening platform was further constructed by coupling with this D&#8208;allulose&#8208;detecting biosensor for the directed evolution of the KEases. Structural analysis of Sinorhizobium fredii D&#8208;allulose 3&#8208;epimerase (SfDAE) revealed that a highly flexible helix/loop region exposes or occludes the catalytic center as an essential lid conformation regulating substrate recognition. We reprogrammed SfDAE using structure&#8208;guided rational design and directed evolution, in which a mutant M3&#8208;2 was identified with 17&#8208;fold enhanced catalytic efficiency. Our research offers a paradigm for the design and optimization of a biosensor&#8208;based microdroplet screening platform.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective radical difunctionalization of alkenes from readily available alkyl halides and organophosphorus reagents possessing a P&#8211;H bond provides an appealing approach for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral alkyl phosphorus compounds. The major challenge arises from the easy generation of a P&#8208;centered radical from the P&#8211;H&#8208;type reagents and its facile addition to the terminal side of alkenes, leading to reverse chemoselectivity. We herein disclose a radical 1,2&#8208;carbophosphonylation of styrenes in a highly chemo&#8208; and enantioselective manner. The key to the success lies in not only the implementation of dialkyl phosphites with a strong bond dissociation energy to promote the desired chemoselectivity but also the utilization of an anionic chiral N,N,N&#8208;ligand to forge the chiral C(sp3)&#8211;P bond. The developed Cu/N,N,N&#8208;ligand catalyst has enriched our library of single&#8208;electron transfer catalysts in the enantioselective radical transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;LYTACs for Targeted Degradation of Extracellular and Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, lysosome targeting chimeras (LYTACs) have emerged as a promising technology that expands the scope of targeted protein degradation to extracellular targets. However, the preparation of chimeras by conjugation of the antibody and trivalent N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine (tri&#8208;GalNAc) is a complex and time&#8208;consuming process. The large uncertainty in number and position and the large molecular weights of the chimeras results in low internalization efficiency. To circumvent these problems, we developed the first aptamer&#8208;based LYTAC (Apt&#8208;LYTAC) to realize liver cell&#8208;specific degradation of extracellular and membrane proteins by conjugating aptamers to tri&#8208;GalNAc. Taking advantage of the facile synthesis and low molecular weight of aptamer, the Apt&#8208;LYTACs can efficiently and quickly degrade the extracellular protein PDGF and the membrane protein PTK7 through a lysosomal degradation pathway. We anticipate that the novel Apt&#8208;LYTACs will expand the usage of aptamers and provide a new dimension for targeted protein degradation.</dc:description>
