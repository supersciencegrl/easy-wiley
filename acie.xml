         <title>ABC&#8208;seq Expands Small RNAs Profiling with Successive Nucleic Acid Structure&#8208;differentiated Enzymatic Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small RNAs (smRNAs) play crucial roles in gene regulation, but current sequencing methods face a set of tangled challenges, including adapter ligation bias, high adapter dimer byproducts, and amplification variability, which limit their capacity to fully capture smRNA diversity. Here, we develop ABC&#8208;seq, a general strategy to enhance smRNA recognition through successive structure&#8208;differentiated recognition. First, we designed randomized adapters to reduce ligation bias to improve the recognition of diverse smRNA species. Then, we operate two product structure&#8208;differentiated enzymatic reactions to maximally suppress randomized adapter dimer. Furthermore, the randomized sequence in adapters serve as unique molecular identifiers(UMIs) in smRNA&#8208;seq data analysis to counteract amplification stochasticity and improve quantification accuracy. Using ABC&#8208;seq, we identified a wider range of smRNAs, including miRNAs, scRNAs, and snoRNAs, in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes, detecting 9.4% more miRNAs compared to traditional methods. Additionally, ABC&#8208;seq revealed smRNAs associated with cancer drug responses and their roles in immune modulation in non&#8208;small cell lung cancer. ABC&#8208;seq expands the smRNA landscape and offers new insights into complex gene regulatory networks.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing matching interfaces by amorphous engineering for enhanced lithium ion transport in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;iodine batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;iodine (Li&#8208;I2) batteries have shown prospects as their high theoretical capacity, high safety, and abundant iodine resources advantages. However, the interface between the crystalline filler and the flexible polymer skeleton of composite solid electrolytes exhibits inadequate bonding, leading to higher interface energy and sluggish migration dynamics of Li+. In this work, a continuous interface solid electrolyte is designed by combining the atomic structure rearrangement of MOF to achieve interface coupling between MOF and aramid fiber. Based on the experimental results and theoretical calculations, the amorphous engineering promotes Li+ migration and polyiodides confinement effect for Li&#8208;I2 batteries. The batteries show a high capacity of 170.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 5 C and achieve a capacity retention rate of 97.8% after 450 cycles. More impressively, the batteries achieve a long life of 3000 cycles at the high current density of 20 C with a good capacity retention of 94.1%. This work reveals the mechanism of coupled interface with structure matching in Li+ migration and polyiodides integration process, providing guidance for the design of novel composite solid electrolytes to achieve high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;I2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Location&#8208;Differentiated DNA Hierarchical Cyclic Construction Demarcating Identical Biomolecules Across Cell Membrane Microenvironments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Local molecular composition across cell membrane microenvironments exerts profound effects on cellular physiology and pathology. Yet spatial demarcation of identical biomolecules inside and outside lipid raft microdomains has not been determined. Here we report location&#8208;differentiated DNA hierarchical cyclic construction for lipid raft&#8208;differentiated spatial profiling of identical biomolecules in living cells. It contains two sequential DNA cyclic construction reactions: primary one triggered by total target molecules and secondary one activated by lipid raft&#8217;s location markers proximal to target molecules. Using this method, we differentially visualize identical biomolecules localized in lipid raft and non&#8208;lipid raft microdomains with different signals. We demonstrate the robustness and universality of this method by testing cell surface RNAs and proteins in diverse cell types. We reveal their diverse spatial demarcation with intrinsic heterogeneity. In both lipid raft&#8208;disrupting cells and senescent cells, MUC1 protein is dynamically organized between these two microdomains. Our strategy provides a promising avenue to investigate physiological and pathological functions of dynamic molecular compositions across cellular microenvironments.</dc:description>

         <title>p&#8211;p Orbital Hybridization Stabilizing Lattice Oxygen in Two&#8208;Dimensional Amorphous RuOx for Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is developed to stabilize lattice oxygen in 2D amorphous RuOx through p&#8211;p orbital hybridization by incorporating dopants such as Al, Ga, and In, which facilitates the switch from the lattice oxygen mechanism to the adsorbate evolution mechanism. In contrast, doping with other elements, such as Mn, Co, or Cu, results in negligible improvements in catalytic performance.








Abstract
Developing efficient Ru&#8208;based catalysts is crucial in reducing reliance on costly Ir for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, these Ru&#8208;based catalysts face a fundamental stability challenge due to the highly reactive nature of lattice oxygen. In this work, we propose an effective strategy to stabilize lattice oxygen in 2D amorphous RuOx through p&#8211;p orbital hybridization by incorporating dopants such as Al, Ga, and In. Notably, Ga doping exhibits remarkable acidic OER performance, leading to a 137&#160;mV reduction in overpotential at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a 125&#8208;fold improvement in stability compared to undoped RuOx. This also surpasses the performances of most reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts. In contrast, doping with other elements from the same period, such as Mn, Co, or Cu, shows negligible improvements in catalytic performance. In situ electrochemical spectroscopic analysis, couples with theoretical calculations, reveals that the p&#8211;p orbital hybridization in the Ga&#8211;O coordination within Ga&#8211;RuOx effectively reduces the reactivity of lattice oxygen, suppresses the overoxidation of Ru, and switches the reaction pathway from the lattice oxygen mechanism to the adsorbate evolution mechanism. This novel p&#8211;p orbital hybridization strategy holds great potential for the development of efficient and robust electrocatalysts for OER and beyond.

Abstract
This work presents the first general synthetic access to N&#8208;CH&#8322;F and N&#8208;CHRF carbamates, thiocarbamates, formamides, alkynamides, and related compounds.

         <title>Facile N&#9552;N Bond Cleavage of Cis&#8208;Azobenzene with Bis&#8208;silylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unexpectedly easy N&#9552;N bond scission of cis&#8208;azobenzene using two bis&#8208;silylenes with different spacers and distinct SiII&#183;&#183;&#183;SiII distances is reported. While both bis&#8208;silylenes enable C&#9472;H and N&#9552;N &#960;&#8208;bond activation of trans&#8208;azobenzene, the cooperative disilicon(II)&#8208;mediated activation of cis&#8208;azobenzene leads to bis&#8208;silamines (Si&#9552;N) and related novel products.

The very different features of cooperative disilicon(II)&#8208;mediated N&#9552;N bond activation of trans&#8208; vs. cis&#8208;azobenzene are reported, employing two bis&#8208;silylenes with distinct intramolecular Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si distances, PhN(LSi:)&#8322; 1 (L&#160;=&#160;PhC(tBuN)&#8322;, Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si: 2.9&#160;&#197;) and XT(LSi:)&#8322; 2 (XT&#160;=&#160;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene&#8208;4,5&#8208;diyl, Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si: 4.3&#160;&#197;). While trans&#8208;azobenzene reacts with both bis&#8208;silylenes to form C&#9472;H and N&#9552;N &#960;&#160;bond activation products, the cis&#8208;isomer undergoes only N&#9552;N bond scission. Thus, the reaction of 1 with cis&#8208;azobenzene at room temperature affords the unprecedented N&#9552;N bond cleavage product 4, featuring a bis&#8208;silaimine with terminal and bridging Si&#9552;N moieties. In contrast, the reaction of 2 with cis&#8208;azobenzene at &#8211;30 &#176;C in THF allows for the isolation of the [1+2] cycloaddition intermediate 6, containing a three&#8208;membered SiN&#8322; ring (siladiazirane), which rearranges to the N&#9552;N bond cleavage product 8 at room temperature. Compound 6 reacts with one additional equivalent of cis&#8208;azobenzene to form bis&#8208;silaazirane 7 with two SiN&#8322; rings. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support stepwise Si(II)&#183;&#183;&#183;Si(II) cooperative activation mechanisms and provide insights into the role of bis&#8208;silylenes for selective N&#9552;N cleavage reactions.

&lt;p&gt;The unexpectedly easy N&#9552;N bond scission of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-azobenzene using two bis-silylenes with different spacers and distinct Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;&#183;&#183;Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; distances is reported. While both bis-silylenes enable C&#9472;H and N&#9552;N &#960;-bond activation of &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-azobenzene, the cooperative disilicon(II)-mediated activation of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-azobenzene leads to bis-silamines (Si&#9552;N) and related novel products.

         <title>Luminescent Detection of Photomagnetic Effect in a Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Neodymium(III)&#8211;Octacyanidotungstate(IV) Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometallic neodymium(III)&#8211;tungsten(IV) layered cyanido&#8208;bridged framework combines 4f&#8208;metal&#8208;centered near&#8208;infrared emission with a thermally reversible octacyanidotungstate(IV)&#8208;based photomagnetic response. As a result, it exhibits an unprecedented photoluminescent read&#8208;out of photo&#8208;induced changes in magnetization relying on the ratio between two selected peaks of excitation spectra and their temperature dependence.








Abstract
Photomagnetic materials form a class of magnetic systems, in which light irradiation changes their magnetization. Photomagnetic behavior is often observed in spin transition materials, including spin&#8208;crossover complexes, and can lead to long&#8208;range magnetic ordering. Photo&#8208;induced magnetization can affect different physical properties, including second harmonic generation. Still, despite a growing number of luminescent spin&#8208;crossover systems, the simultaneous switching of both magnetism and luminescence was not yet explored. In this regard, we present systematic studies for a novel coordination polymer composed of anionic NdIII&#8211;[WIV(CN)8]4&#8211; layers, crystallizing with chiral organic cations embedded in the interlayer space. Not only we observe and rationalize theoretically near&#8208;infrared emission of NdIII centers sensitized by [WIV(CN)8]4&#8211; units, but we also found a plausible pathway to track the photomagnetic effect throughout the analysis of the Nd3+ excitation spectra and their temperature dependence. The observed thermally reversible effects in luminescence were correlated with the results of photomagnetic studies, providing an attractive pathway to monitor the light&#8208;induced magnetization changes through a photoluminescent read&#8208;out.

         <title>Controlled Growth of Oligophenylene&#8208;Structures on Graphene for Facile Secondary Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By thermal decomposition of different BPO&#8208;based peroxides with different substituents, dendrimeric oligophenylene structures with thicknesses up to 10&#160;nm have been grown on graphene in a controlled manner. These newly introduced structures provide active sites for further functionalization as they have a higher reactivity than the graphene lattice, as shown by their subsequent functionalization with bromomethyl groups. These functional oligophenylene structures can serve as a versatile platform for secondary functionalization, as shown by the introduction of azide, nitrile, and phosphonate groups. The approach presented here opens up a novel route to generate nanometer&#8208;sized graphene&#8208;based materials with tailored properties for subsequent applications.








Abstract
Functionalization of graphene derivatives is a common approach to tune material properties for use in various applications. Because of the low reactivity of the unsaturated carbon lattice of graphene, not only are few chemical approaches suitable for successful functionalization, such as those involving highly reactive in situ formed radical species or nitrene and carbene compounds, but also the degree of functionalization is usually limited, modifying only a few percent of the carbon atoms. Typically, uncontrolled side reactions such as homocoupling and oligomerization of newly introduced functional groups can occur instead of direct coupling to the carbon lattice. We want to turn this unwanted side reaction into an advantage and use intentionally formed covalent dendrimeric oligophenylene structures for secondary functionalization. We show that these oligomeric structures can be grown to specific thicknesses and used for further functionalization with bromomethyl groups at high density on the surface. This functionalization opens further avenues for subsequent nucleophilic substitution, as exemplified by the introduction of versatile azide, nitrile, and phosphonate groups. The results presented here are not only applicable to large oligophenylene structures, but also demonstrate that, in principle, single aryl moieties on graphene of any size and density can be successfully functionalized.

Abstract
We present a versatile platform for fabricating two&#8208;photon excitable carbon dot&#8208;based nanocomposite thin films by harnessing the structural versatility of polymer brushes in combination with electron&#8208;beam lithography (EBL). This approach enables the precise spatial organization of carbon dots (CDs) at the nanoscale, facilitating dynamic modulation of their photoluminescent properties in response to environmental stimuli. Three model systems were examined, incorporating pH&#8208; and thermally responsive polymers, functionalized through covalent and dynamic covalent bonding strategies. By leveraging the spatial control afforded by nanostructured polymer brushes, we achieved precise tuning of optical properties while mitigating aggregation&#8208;induced quenching, a longstanding challenge in solid&#8208;state CD applications. In addition to the advances in controlling optical properties, this work highlights the potential of polymer brush systems to function as optically active, reprogrammable surfaces. The resulting nanoscale&#8208;engineered materials exhibit highly responsive, reconfigurable photonic behavior, offering a scalable pathway for integrating advanced optical interfaces into microchip technologies, biosensing platforms, and multiplexed diagnostic systems. The fusion of polymer brushes, carbon dots, and advanced lithographic techniques marks a substantial advancement in the development of functional materials with nanoscale precision and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Blind UV Organic Mechanoluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to achieve solar&#8208;blind UV mechanoluminescent (ML) materials through strategically breaking the molecular conjugation and adjusting the packing mode. DPO3C and DPO4C exhibited solar&#8208;blind UV emission with the maxima at ca. 293&#160;nm, with wide&#8208;range color&#8208;tunable ML emissions from 293 to 741&#160;nm via host&#8211;guest doping. This study also paves the way for advancements in bright&#8208;field stress visualization.








Abstract
Organic mechanoluminescent (ML) materials have attracted intensive attention for their potential applications in real&#8208;time stress sensing and structural damage monitoring. To avoid interference from daylight or artificial lighting sources, the ML&#8208;based sensors can be only used in dark&#8208;field scenarios, which becomes the most serious limitation for their development. Herein, we proposed a new strategy that adjusts the ML spectra to the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) region to address this challenge. By strategically breaking the molecular conjugation and adjusting the packing mode, a series of diphenylphosphine oxide derivatives were successfully designed. To our delight, the shortest ML emission, among all reported organic ML materials, with the maxima at ca. 293&#160;nm (in solar&#8208;blind UV region) was achieved. Photophysical studies, single crystal analysis, and theoretical calculations were performed to investigate the solar&#8208;blind UV ML properties. Furthermore, wide&#8208;range color&#8208;tunable ML emissions spanning from 293 to 741&#160;nm were achieved. Under various external stimuli such as stretching, folding, and vehicle impact in daylight, obvious ML signals could be directly recorded, and the quantitative relationship between the mechanical stimuli and the ML intensities was also studied. This work suggests a feasible strategy to realize solar&#8208;blind UV ML materials and makes bright&#8208;field environment ML sensors possible.

DPO3C and DPO4C exhibited solar-blind UV emission with the maxima at ca. 293&#160;nm, with wide-range color-tunable ML emissions from 293 to 741&#160;nm via host&#8211;guest doping. This study also paves the way for advancements in bright-field stress visualization.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic mechanoluminescent (ML) materials have attracted intensive attention for their potential applications in real-time stress sensing and structural damage monitoring. To avoid interference from daylight or artificial lighting sources, the ML-based sensors can be only used in dark-field scenarios, which becomes the most serious limitation for their development. Herein, we proposed a new strategy that adjusts the ML spectra to the solar-blind ultraviolet (UV) region to address this challenge. By strategically breaking the molecular conjugation and adjusting the packing mode, a series of diphenylphosphine oxide derivatives were successfully designed. To our delight, the shortest ML emission, among all reported organic ML materials, with the maxima at ca. 293&#160;nm (in solar-blind UV region) was achieved. Photophysical studies, single crystal analysis, and theoretical calculations were performed to investigate the solar-blind UV ML properties. Furthermore, wide-range color-tunable ML emissions spanning from 293 to 741&#160;nm were achieved. Under various external stimuli such as stretching, folding, and vehicle impact in daylight, obvious ML signals could be directly recorded, and the quantitative relationship between the mechanical stimuli and the ML intensities was also studied. This work suggests a feasible strategy to realize solar-blind UV ML materials and makes bright-field environment ML sensors possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lysine&#8208;Targeting, Covalent Inhibitors of Bromodomain BD1 of BET Proteins in Live Cells and Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully developed the first BD1&#8208;targted covalent inhibitor (TCI), BDS4, by utilizing 2&#8208;ethynylbenzaldehyde (EBA). Importantly, BDS4 retained robust activity against fibrosis in cells and animals when compared to the marginal effects of BD2 inhibitor RVX&#8208;208. Our developed tool showed clear advantages of long&#8208;lasting domain&#8208;selective TCI in delineating the district function of BD1 and BD2. 








Abstract
The bromodomain extra&#8208;terminal (BET) family of proteins are valuable therapeutic targets for cancer and other diseases. The adverse events of current pan&#8208;BET inhibitors (BETi) make the development of BET BD1&#8208; or BD2&#8208;selective inhibitors as a fresh avenue to overcome safety challenges. On the basis of various lysine&#8208;reactive covalent warheads herein we report a set of activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs; P3&#8211;P7) capable of global profiling of ligandable lysines within bromodomains (BRDs) in live cells and animals. Chemoproteomic experiments with P7, which utilizes 2&#8208;ethynylbenzaldehyde (EBA), identified 16 endogenous BRDs, thus giving a global landscape of ligandable lysines in BRDs. By further introducing EBA and salicylaldehyde into PLX51107 (a noncovalent BETi), we generated lysine&#8208;reactive, irreversible (BDS1&#8211;4) and reversible (BDS5&#8211;6) BD1 covalent inhibitors. Mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the successful covalent engagement between EBA and K91 near the acetylated lysine (Kac)&#8208;binding site of BD1 in BRD4. BDS4 showed 104&#8208;fold selectivity for BD1 over BD2 with prolonged anticancer effects. Importantly, BDS4 retained robust activity against fibrosis in cells and animals when compared to RVX&#8208;208 (a reported BD2&#8208;selective noncovalent inhibitor), which showed only marginal effects. Our work serves as a useful tool to delineate distinct functions of BD1 and BD2 in future studies.

         <title>Design Strategies Based on Electronic Interactions for Effective Catalysts in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design of effective bidirectional electrocatalyst focused on electronic interactions in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Development of effective bidirectional catalyst is essential for high&#8208;energy density and long&#8208;life lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The catalytic activity of catalyst is directly related to the degree of the interaction between the catalysts and adsorbates. In the review, we introduce the design strategy for catalysts with high catalytic activity focused on the electronic structure and properties of catalysts and reactants.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are considered promising next&#8208;generation batteries due to their high energy density (&gt;500&#160;W h kg&#8722;1). However, LSBs exhibit an unsatisfactory energy density (&lt;400&#160;W h kg&#8722;1) and cycle life (&lt;300 cycles) because of the shuttle effect caused by soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPS) intermediates and the sluggish conversion reaction kinetics caused by insulating sulfur (S8) and lithium sulfide (Li2S). Although various types of catalysts, including metal&#8208;based compounds to single&#8208;atom catalysts, have been reported to address these issues, most catalysts exhibited limited catalytic activity under practical lean electrolyte conditions (&lt;5&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1). A comprehensive understanding of the synthetic strategy and catalytic mechanism of catalysts is essential for their design, but understanding the electronic effects of the catalysts and LiPS is more important. Furthermore, the electronic design of these catalysts is not well understood. In this review, we introduce the catalytic mechanisms in LSBs and discuss catalyst design strategies in terms of electronic effects on the interactions between reactants and catalysts, with a primary focus on heterogeneous catalytic systems. We additionally consider how the electronic property of homogeneous systems, particularly redox mediators, affects catalytic behavior under lean electrolyte conditions and propose future research directions for catalyst development in LSBs.

         <title>Iron(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;H Hydroxylation of Low&#8208;Density Polyethylene Coupled with Short Chain Branching Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative degradation enables C&#9472;H hydroxylation of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) along with the growth of methyl and ethyl short&#8208;chain branches. Fluorine on the ligand enhances the interaction with LDPE while facilitating hydrogen peroxide activation. The growth of short&#8208;chain branches occurs via &#946;&#8208;scission of CC bonds and a radical&#8208;mediated chain&#8208;walking mechanism. The oxidized LDPE exhibits significantly improved mechanical properties. 








Abstract
Low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) is widely used in packaging applications, but after being discarded its environmental impact is a pressing concern due to a lack of effective chemical recycling strategies, especially owing to its chemical inertness and nonpolar nature. To address these challenges, we present a mild iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative upcycling of LDPE in which C&#9472;H hydroxylation of LDPE occurs coupled with the growth of methyl short chain branching (Me&#8208;SCB) and ethyl shortchain branching (Et&#8208;SCB). As a result, the resulting products achieve significant improvements in surface wettability, crystallinity, and mechanical properties despite a concomitant reduction in molecular weight. CH&#8230;F interactions and &#963;&#8211;&#960; interactions are found between LDPE and the catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate the catalytic mechanism that fluorine on the ligand facilitates hydrogen peroxide activation and subsequent deprotonation, leading to the formation of high&#8208;valent ironoxo species. The growth of short&#8208;chain branching (SCB) involves the &#946;&#8208;scission of CC bonds and a radical&#8208;mediated chain&#8208;walking mechanism. This work represents a transformative advancement in deep understanding of polyolefin upcycling and opens a new approach of polyolefin functionalization and architecture modulation.

         <title>Selenite&#8208;Directed Organotin&#8211;Oxo Macrocycles for Nanolithography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four high&#8208;nuclearity organotin&#8211;oxo macrocyclic clusters&#8212;Sn8, Sn12&#8208;&#945;, Sn12&#8208;&#946;, and Sn12Fe18&#8212;were successfully constructed utilizing the unique trigonal pyramidal geometry of selenite ligands, and then their lithographic performance was systematically investigated.








Abstract
The systematic design of organotin&#8211;oxo macrocycles with enhanced extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photon&#8208;harvesting capability and sub&#8208;50&#160;nm lithographic resolution remains a pivotal challenge in advancing nanofabrication technologies. Herein, we present a novel series of polynuclear nbutyltin&#8211;oxygen macrocycles&#8212;Sn8, Sn12&#8208;&#945;, Sn12&#8208;&#946;, and Sn12Fe18&#8212;constructed through selenite ligand&#8208;driven supramolecular assembly. Among these, Sn12&#8208;&#945; demonstrated exceptional electron beam lithography (EBL) performance, achieving a critical dimension resolution of 50&#160;nm at a low dose of 50 &#181;C&#183;cm&#8722;2, attributed to its elevated Sn/Se content, compact molecular architecture (diameter, 1.5&#160;nm), and excellent film&#8208;forming ability (surface roughness, 0.59&#160;nm). By replacing conventional carboxylate ligands with inorganic selenite, this study addresses longstanding limitations in structural versatility and EUV absorption efficiency inherent to traditional organotin&#8211;oxo systems. These findings establish a paradigm for engineering metal&#8211;oxide photoresists through ligand&#8208;driven cluster dimensionality control, offering a scalable pathway to high&#8208;sensitivity, high&#8208;resolution patterning for next&#8208;generation semiconductor manufacturing.

By replacing conventional carboxylate ligands with inorganic selenite, this study addresses longstanding limitations in structural versatility and EUV absorption efficiency inherent to traditional organotin&#8211;oxo systems. These findings establish a paradigm for engineering metal&#8211;oxide photoresists through ligand-driven cluster dimensionality control, offering a scalable pathway to high-sensitivity, high-resolution patterning for next-generation semiconductor manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Activation of C&#9472;H Bond in Toluene by Titanium Dioxide&#8208;Supported Subnanometric PtOx Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectrocatalytic activation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds in hydrocarbon molecules to produce valuable oxygenates still suffers from the limited generation of reactive species and the weak adsorption of reactants. This study achieved the selective oxidation of toluene using a TiO2 supported subnanometric PtOx cluster (PtOx/TiO2) photoanode via an electrophilic OH*&#8208;mediated pathway. The modification of PtOx cluster can facilitate toluene adsorption and OH* generation, leading to the high efficiency of toluene oxidation.








Abstract
Selective oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds via photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) strategy provides a promising approach to synthesize valuable oxygenates, but the efficiency of this process is still unsatisfactory due to the stable nature of hydrocarbon molecules. Herein, we report the PEC oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde (BA) over a subnanometric PtOx cluster&#8208;loaded TiO2 (PtOx/TiO2) photoanode, achieving BA production rate of 1.75&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8210;2 h&#8210;1 with selectivity of 83.5% in aqueous medium, which is 4.4&#8208;fold higher than that of pristine TiO2. The strategy is also effective for the selective oxidation of toluene derivatives. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we fabricate a self&#8208;powered PEC tandem device with S&#8208;shaped flow channels for the oxidation of toluene, producing BA with a productivity of &#8764;170&#160;&#181;mol under light irradiation. Experimental studies combined with density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the toluene oxidation over PtOx/TiO2 photoanode follow an electrophilic hydroxyl species (OH*)&#8208;mediated pathway, which can suppress the over&#8208;oxidation of BA. Moreover, we reveal that subnanometric PtOx clusters promote toluene adsorption and OH* species generation, leading to the high efficiency of toluene oxidation. This work is expected to broaden the avenue toward the activation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bond under mild conditions in aqueous solution via a sustainable way.

         <title>Revealing the Nature of Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in Ionic Liquids by Combined Pulse EPR and 19F NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids have been proposed as alternatives to molecular solvents. Here, spin probes and spin&#8208;labelled ILs are studied by pulse electron paramagnetic resonance, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR, molecular dynamics, and density functional theory, revealing the IL interaction sphere. The results challenge previous interpretations of nitroxide&#8208;solvent nanostructuring in ILs.








Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) are a unique class of compounds that have attracted interest for numerous and diverse applications, ranging from solvents for sustainable synthesis to sustainable electrolytes. Understanding their nanostructure and solute&#8208;solvent interactions is a prerequisite to harnessing the full potential of ILs. It has been proposed that ILs solvate non&#8208;polar solutes via their alkyl chains through the formation of nanoscale structures, such as micelles. Here, we determine the non&#8208;covalent interactions responsible for such nanostructuring in ILs. We use pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) NMR, molecular dynamics (MD), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with ILs tailored to probe specific interactions through spin and isotopic labelling. Inter&#8208; and intramolecular cation&#8211;anion interactions are probed by electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and 19F PRE experiments and show that nitroxide solutes associate with the polar domains of the imidazolium cation through weak hydrogen bonding with the imidazolium ring protons, as supported by MD simulations. Thus, this study reveals a less structured nanostructure than a micellar picture might suggest, but with clear IL cation&#8208;solute interactions. Our methodology to reveal nanostructure not only has implications for ILs but is also applicable to other soft matter systems.

         <title>p&#8211;&#960; Conjugation&#8208;Promoted Electrochemiluminescence of Halogenated Covalent Organic Framework Nanoemitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a series of halogenated COF nanoemitters via a covalent halogenation predesign strategy. The introduction of halogen atoms facilitates p&#8211;&#960; conjugation within COF skeleton, leading to a 49&#8208;fold ECL enhancement compared to nonhalogenated COF. Furthermore, the performance of four partially brominated COFs establishes a positive correlation between the degree of Br doping and ECL intensity.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a kind of promising electrochemiluminescence (ECL) crystalline nanoemitters due to their rapid intrareticular charge transfer and predesigned structures. However, the high polarization of heteroatom&#8208;containing linkages impedes the charge transfer within reticular structures. In this study, we construct a series of halogenated COFs nanoemitters composed of terephthalaldehyde ortho&#8208;substitutions and 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene ligands via a covalent halogenation predesign strategy. The incorporation of covalently bonded halogen atoms promotes a dense electron population in carbon&#8211;carbon antibonding molecular orbitals, thereby facilitating efficient p&#8211;&#960; conjugation within the COF structure. Based on the improved intrareticular charge transfer along carbon skeleton, as evidenced by the Hall effect and terahertz spectroscopy, the brominated COF demonstrates a 49&#8208;fold enhancement in ECL intensity compared to nonhalogenated COF. Furthermore, the performance of four partially brominated COFs establishes a positive correlation between the degree of Br doping and ECL intensity. Beyond the corresponding model compounds, the conjugated frameworks of COFs significantly amplify the halogenation&#8208;induced enhancement effect. This halogenation&#8208;promoted p&#8211;&#960; conjugation in reticular skeleton provides a universal strategy to sensitize crystalline nanoemitters for decoding ECL enhancement mechanism.

         <title>Modular Access to Fluorinated Quaternary Stereocenters via Palladium/Lewis Base Synergistic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereocontrolled construction of fluorinated quaternary stereocenters in acyclic systems remains a significant synthetic challenge. We report a synergistic palladium/Lewis base catalytic platform that directly couples &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl acetates with allenes or 1,3&#8208;dienes without directing groups. This strategy overcomes traditional limitations in fluoronucleophile activation and stereochemical control, enabling access to diverse acyclic fluorinated architectures. Key to success is the use of axial&#8208;chiral Lewis bases, which work cooperatively with palladium catalysts to govern both enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. The method accommodates broad substrate scope, including aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic systems, while demonstrating scalability and synthetic versatility through downstream transformations. This work not only bridges essential voids in fluorinated stereochemical space but also enhances the practical applications of synergistic catalytst systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Crystallization and Photothermal Aging Chemistry of CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3 for Inorganic Perovskite Tandem Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The poor performance of inorganic narrow bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hinders the development of inorganic perovskite tandem solar cells (IPTSCs). We modulate the crystallization and photothermal aging chemistry for CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3 (1.31 eV) with guanidinoacetic acid (GCA) to develop IPTSC. The CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3:GCA PSC reaches an efficiency of 16.93% and maintains an initial efficiency of ~80% (T80) for 1300 h under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) at 65 &#176;C. We identify that there are not only ionic migration species (I&#8208;, I3&#8208;), but also molecular migration species (SnI4, I2) for CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3 correlated to the photothermal dynamics. For CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3 film, the intractable pinholes accelerate the iodine migration to the electrode and photothermal degradation. The photodegradation of PbI2 produces I2 and then promotes the Sn2+ oxidation to Sn4+, causing tin migration in the form of SnI4 to accumulate at the ETL/perovskite interface, and in turn generating more and more pinholes and Sn&#8208;Pb segregation. In CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3:GCA film, due to the coordination bonds with Pb/Sn cations and hydrogen bonds with I&#8208; ions, GCA incorporation&#8208;induced pinhole&#8208;free morphology can significantly suppress ion/molecule migration. Hence, combined with CsPbI2Br subcell, 2T IPTSC delivers an efficiency of 22.18%, accompanied by T80 = 850 h under MPPT at 65 &#176;C.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The poor performance of inorganic narrow bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hinders the development of inorganic perovskite tandem solar cells (IPTSCs). We modulate the crystallization and photothermal aging chemistry for CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3 (1.31 eV) with guanidinoacetic acid (GCA) to develop IPTSC. The CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3:GCA PSC reaches an efficiency of 16.93% and maintains an initial efficiency of ~80% (T80) for 1300 h under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) at 65 &#176;C. We identify that there are not only ionic migration species (I-, I3-), but also molecular migration species (SnI4, I2) for CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3 correlated to the photothermal dynamics. For CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3 film, the intractable pinholes accelerate the iodine migration to the electrode and photothermal degradation. The photodegradation of PbI2 produces I2 and then promotes the Sn2+ oxidation to Sn4+, causing tin migration in the form of SnI4 to accumulate at the ETL/perovskite interface, and in turn generating more and more pinholes and Sn-Pb segregation. In CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3:GCA film, due to the coordination bonds with Pb/Sn cations and hydrogen bonds with I- ions, GCA incorporation-induced pinhole-free morphology can significantly suppress ion/molecule migration. Hence, combined with CsPbI2Br subcell, 2T IPTSC delivers an efficiency of 22.18%, accompanied by T80 = 850 h under MPPT at 65 &#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Electric Double Layers via Polymer Electric Dipole Effects to Enhance Stability in Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interfacial instability of Na metal anodes poses a significant barrier to the practical applications of sodium metal batteries. According to electric double layer (EDL) theory, the potential difference in the Helmholtz layer critically affects electrochemical reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, which governs the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composition and the Na deposition process. Herein, we leverage the electric dipole effect of polymers, formed via in situ polymerization of butyl acrylate (BA), which preferentially adsorbs on the Na metal surface, to modulate the conformation of the EDL. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that poly&#8208;BA facilitates the formation of a more compressed diffuse layer and reduces the potential difference in the Helmholtz layer. This compressed EDL with the change of species derives homogeneous SEI, enabling reversible Na plating/stripping. As a result, the poly&#8208;BA quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte extends the lifespan of the Na||Na cell to 3500 hours at 0.1 mA cm&#8722;2. Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cells maintain stable cycling over 1500 cycles, with a capacity retention of 87.6% at 5 C. Our findings indicate that modulating the EDL structure via the electric dipole effect of polymers enables uniform Na deposition, offering a promising strategy for designing electrolytes for practical quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying the Role of Solvation Entropy for the Solvation Chemistry in Non&#8208;Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvating power, a pivotal determinant of solvation structure, has been extensively studied in past few decades. However, extant descriptors such as donor number and binding energy, predominantly focus on solvation enthalpy, while ignoring crucial solvation entropy, which often leads to contradictory conclusions. Here, we surmount this issue by exploring the relationship between the solvation thermodynamics and solvating power. It is revealed that high solvation entropy of polydentate solvents (DME, DGDME, etc.) endows them with strong solvating power in spite of their low binding energy. Even for monodentate solvents, solvation entropy is also nonnegligible. Thus, solvation free energy (&#916;G) is firstly proposed as a perfect descriptor of solvating power, which includes the effect of solvation entropy. Drawing on profound insights of solvation thermodynamics and solvating power, a database of &#916;GAvg and permittivity of common solvents is established to provide pivotal inspirations for the design of solvation structure for next&#8208;generation advanced electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Narrow&#8208;Band Dibenzoselenophene&#8208;Based Emitter with Rapid Triplet Conversion for Versatile OLED Applications with Superior Roll&#8208;Off Suppression</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selenium&#8208;containing multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials with ultra&#8208;fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) have emerged as a promising solution for mitigating efficiency roll&#8208;off in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, we introduce DBSeBN, the first MR&#8208;TADF emitter incorporating a rigid five&#8208;membered dibenzoselenophene unit. This design simultaneously achieves a narrow full width at half maximum of 23 nm across a wide range of doping concentrations in films, along with an ultra&#8208;fast RISC rate of 1.1x107 s&#8208;1, which is two orders higher than that of its sulfur&#8208;containing counterpart, DBTBN, due to the enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling via the heavy atom effect of selenium. As an OLED emitter, DBSeBN demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.6% and retaining 23.3% at 1000 cd m&#8208;2, surpassing DBTBN in suppressing efficiency roll&#8208;off. Its remarkably fast RISC and insensitivity to doping concentration enable unprecedented versatility in advanced OLED architectures. As a sensitizer in sensitized green&#8208;fluorescent OLEDs, it surpasses Ir&#8208;based complex sensitizers in reducing efficiency roll&#8208;off. As a blue emitter in bi&#8208;color white OLEDs, it effectively harnesses high&#8208;energy triplet excitons to minimize efficiency roll&#8208;off. DBSeBN thus expands the scope of MR&#8208;TADF materials across various kinds of OLED applications while suppressing efficiency roll&#8208;off.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Urea&#8208;based Units into Porphyrinic Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Artemisinin Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artemisinin and its derivatives are the most efficacious treatment for malaria, and the artificial synthesis of artemisinin supplies a promising method to satisfy market demand. However, conventional artemisinin preparation via homogeneous photo/acid&#8208;catalytic reactions usually suffers from the difficulty in recycling the photo/acid&#8208;catalysts and treating waste acid. Consequently, it is still highly urgent for developing environment&#8208;friendly and effective artificial preparation methods for artemisinin. Herein, a dual&#8208;function covalent organic framework (COF), named Urea&#8208;COF, has been synthesized from the condensation of meso&#8208;tetra(p&#8208;formylphenyl)porphyrin with 1,3&#8208;bis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)urea. Urea&#8208;COF exhibits a high surface area of 1732 m2 g&#8208;1 with a large pore size of 3.1 nm, enabling a fast mass transport and high accessibility of urea groups. The urea groups as hydrogen bond donor catalytic sites bind strongly to the carboxylic acid to release H+, thereby increasing the acidity of the carboxylic acid. This, in combination with the exceptional capacity of porphyrin macrocycles to generate singlet oxygen, endows Urea&#8208;COF with excellent heterogeneous photocatalytic activity towards tandem semisynthesis of artemisinin from dihydroartemisinic acid in a high conversion rate (99%) and yield (71%) without additional acid, superior to all the thus far reported homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Al&#8208;S Batteries by Spin Polarization Modulation via Catalytic Ni&#8208;MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminum&#8208;sulfur (Al&#8208;S) batteries catalysts with adsorption and catalytic capabilities can effectively improve the slow redox kinetics, but the current research often ignores the effect of optimizing the electronic structure of the catalyst on improving charge transfer and adsorption. Here, Ni&#8208;doped monolayer MoS2 nanosheets are synthesized and used as a catalytic additive for the sulfur cathode. The addition of Ni promotes spin splitting of 4d orbital of Mo, thereby affecting polarization degree of the basal plane sulfur, and making it changed from a low spin state to a high spin one. This high spin configuration raises the electron energy level and provides an active electron state to react with aluminum polysulfides (AlPSs), which optimizes the adsorption energy. At the same time, it accelerates electron transfer and lowers the energy barrier for the overall conversion of the polysulfides. Benefiting from these features, Al&#8208;S batteries based on rationally designed S@Ni&#8208;MoS2/C cathodes exhibit a high initial capacity (1603.0 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1) and extraordinary cycling stability (0.035% capacity decay rate during 2000 cycles). This study showcases a spin&#8208;polarized electronic structure control strategy to enhance catalytic activity, providing a viable approach for developing efficient catalysts for practical Al&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

The addition of Ni promotes spin splitting of 4d orbital of Mo, thereby affecting polarization degree of the basal plane sulfur, and making it changed from a low spin state to a high spin one. This high spin configuration raises the electron energy level and provides an active electron state to react with aluminum polysulfides (AlPSs), which optimizes the adsorption energy. At the same time, it accelerates electron transfer and lowers the energy barrier for the overall conversion of the polysulfides. Benefiting from these features, Al-S batteries based on rationally designed S@Ni-MoS2/C cathodes exhibit a high initial capacity (1603.0 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1) and extraordinary cycling stability (0.035% capacity decay rate during 2000 cycles). This study showcases a spin-polarized electronic structure control strategy to enhance catalytic activity, providing a viable approach for developing efficient catalysts for practical Al-S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hyperstable, Minimal&#8208;Length, and Blunt&#8208;Ended Collagen Heterotrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most natural collagens are heterotrimers &#8211; triple helices formed from three non&#8208;identical peptide strands. The design of synthetic heterotrimeric collagen is challenging since a mixture of three different peptides can form as many as 27 unique triple helices. Here, we present a general method for the assembly of collagen heterotrimers with a wide range of lengths, thermal stabilities, and strand arrangements driven by complementary interstrand salt bridges between (2S,4S)&#8208;4&#8208;aminoproline and aspartate residues. We show how kinetic trapping of undesired trimers can be overcome by adjusting the annealing conditions to obtain the target heterotrimeric helix selectively under thermodynamic control. The design rules and annealing methods allowed the creation of the most stable supramolecular heterotrimer (32 residues, Tm = 76 &#176;C) and the shortest stable heterotrimer (17 residues, Tm = 19 &#176;C) to date. Furthermore, frame&#8208;shifting enabled, for the first time, the creation of a collagen triple helix with blunt ends.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Entanglement Driven Emissive Aggregate Enabling Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Hydrogels with Ultra&#8208;Stretchability and Crack&#8208;Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymeric room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) hydrogels are emerging candidates for many  advanced photonic applications. Unfortunately, phosphorescence of the introduced RTP chromophores can easily be quenched in water&#8208;swollen hydrogel networks, limiting their luminescence performance and application adaptability. Herein, we propose a supramolecular confinement&#8208;entanglement synergy strategy to produce ultra&#8208;stretchable RTP hydrogels by in&#8208;situ polymerizing high&#8208;concentration 2&#8208;(acryloyloxy)ethyl trimethylammonium chloride (AETC) in the presence of pre&#8208;assembled 4&#8208;biphenylboronic acid@&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (4&#8208;BB@&#946;&#8208;CD) emissive aggregates. The hyper&#8208;entangled poly(AETC) (PAETC) chains, formed under water&#8208;limiting conditions, synergistically densify the 4&#8208;BB@&#946;&#8208;CD aggregates through supramolecular confinement, effectively suppressing molecular vibrations and stabilizing triplet states. Impressively, the hydrogels exhibit intense afterglow and ultra&#8208;long phosphorescence lifetime up to 1.1 s under room conditions. Crucially, the entanglement&#8208;dominated physical network free of static chemical crosslinking enables continuing chain disentanglement during stretching for efficient energy dissipation. Segment length between physical entanglement points can thus be significantly enlarged to reduce network fracture and avoid crack propagation, achieving record&#8208;breaking uniaxial/biaxial (21,000%/10,000%) stretchability. Even the notched hydrogels are capable of being unprecedentedly stretched to 20500% and exhibit a fracture energy as high as 157 kJ m&#8315;&#178;, demonstrating intrinsic crack&#8208;tolerance. This study opens new avenues of polymeric RTP hydrogels by bringing superior mechanical performance and should merit their application exploration.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Electrosynthesis of Hydroxylamines via CuS Suppressing N&#8211;O Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic hydroxylamines, pivotal intermediates in pharmaceutical and polymer chemistry, face persistent challenges in selective synthesis. Its main difficulty lies in the strong repulsion between the lone pair electrons on the N and O atoms, which makes their N&#8211;O bond easy to break, leading to over reduction to amine compounds. Here, we present a green electrocatalytic strategy for the first time that converts oximes to hydroxylamines over CuS. Specially, N&#8208;benzylhydroxylamine was achieved with 95% conversion and 80% selectivity from benzaldoxime at &#8211;0.9 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. Mechanistic investigations reveal that CuS can optimize the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates, making N&#8211;O bond more difficult to cleave during the electrocatalytic hydrogenation, thus leading to a high selectivity formation of hydroxylamines. This methodology is successfully extended to other hydroxylamines and further enables the unprecedented synthesis of organic hydroxylamines from nitric oxide gas. Our work establishes a sustainable electrosynthetic platform for hydroxylamines synthesis without organic solvents and additional reduction agents, providing new insights for modern green chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Access to Arylethylamines Enabled by Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;Selective Hydroarylation of Allylic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a modular and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroarylation of readily available allylic amines, affording various valuable arylethylamines with exclusive regiocontrol. The use of NHC&#9472;Ni catalyst was crucial to achieve high efficiency and selectivity. In particular, with bulky chiral NHC ligands, enantioenriched arylethylamines were prepared in high efficiency with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.








Abstract
Arylethylamines are prevalent structural skeletons in bioactive molecules and have significant interest within the organic chemistry community. We report here a modular and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroarylation of readily available allylic amines, delivering a wide variety of valuable arylethylamines with complete regiocontrol under mild conditions. Key to the success of this protocol is the employment of bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) as ligands. Furthermore, the use of chiral NHC ligands enables straightforward access to enantioenriched arylethylamines with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>P&#8208;type Cathode Material Design Guided by Material Descriptors for High&#8208;Energy Density Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The material descriptors are first proposed to guide the design and screening of high&#8208;energy density p&#8208;type organic cathode materials. Triphenylamine and synthesized p&#8208;PZA POP proved the rationality of these descriptors. Na||p&#8208;PZA POP batteries exhibit a surprisingly high energy density of 524.6&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1 and excellent wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance.








Abstract
P&#8208;type organic electrode materials (OEMs) face considerable challenges in constructing high&#8208;energy density sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to their low capacity. To preserve their voltage advantage, developing effective structural design strategies is essential. However, the lack of material descriptors hampers the efficiency of material design and screening. Herein, two material descriptors: the benzene ring/active nitrogen (R/N) ratio and energy density factor (Ef) are established to guide high&#8208;energy density SMB design. As proof of concept, triphenylamine (TPA, 3 R/N ratio and 573.6 Ef value) and a porous organic polymer condensation of triiodotriphenylamine and dihydrophenazine named p&#8208;PZA POP (1.5 R/N ratio and 907.5 Ef value) are chosen. As a result, the p&#8208;PZA POP achieves a high energy density of 524.6&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1, nearly double that of TPA (273.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1). Remarkably, p&#8208;PZA POP demonstrates excellent wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance from 50&#160;&#176;C (166.2&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1) to &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C (141.6&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A g&#8722;1). This work establishes a theoretical framework for the rational design and screening of high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type OEMs through predictive material descriptors.

&lt;p&gt;The material descriptors are first proposed to guide the design and screening of high-energy density p-type organic cathode materials. Triphenylamine and synthesized p-PZA POP proved the rationality of these descriptors. Na||p-PZA POP batteries exhibit a surprisingly high energy density of 524.6&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#160;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and excellent wide-temperature electrochemical performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P-type organic electrode materials (OEMs) face considerable challenges in constructing high-energy density sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to their low capacity. To preserve their voltage advantage, developing effective structural design strategies is essential. However, the lack of material descriptors hampers the efficiency of material design and screening. Herein, two material descriptors: the benzene ring/active nitrogen (R/N) ratio and energy density factor (E&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) are established to guide high-energy density SMB design. As proof of concept, triphenylamine (TPA, 3 R/N ratio and 573.6 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; value) and a porous organic polymer condensation of triiodotriphenylamine and dihydrophenazine named p-PZA POP (1.5 R/N ratio and 907.5 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; value) are chosen. As a result, the p-PZA POP achieves a high energy density of 524.6&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#160;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, nearly double that of TPA (273.3&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Remarkably, p-PZA POP demonstrates excellent wide-temperature electrochemical performance from 50&#160;&#176;C (166.2&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#160;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) to &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C (141.6&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#160;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work establishes a theoretical framework for the rational design and screening of high-performance p-type OEMs through predictive material descriptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effective Hole Utilization for Atomically Dispersed Low&#8208;Coordination Molybdenum Accelerating Photocatalytic C&#9472;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed low&#8208;coordination Mo on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets has been successfully developed for acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols. The isolated Mo sites optimize the driving force of photogenerated holes, which greatly accelerates the electron transfer rate of the alkoxy C&#9472;H bonds, resulting in the formation of high&#8208;concentration alkyl radicals.








Abstract
Photocatalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols offers a promising strategy to produce the corresponding carbonyl compounds and clean fuel H2. However, the sluggish kinetics of the alkoxy C&#9472;H bond cleavage attributes to the inefficient utilization of photogenerated holes greatly restricts the photocatalytic activity. Here we develmically dispersed low&#8208;coordination Mo on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets that can greatly accelerate photocatalytic C&#9472;H activation. An internal quantum efficiency of 45.2% at 400&#160;nm together with 99% benzaldehyde (BAD) selectivity is achieved using benzyl alcohol (BA) as a model substrate. Extensive experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the low&#8208;coordination Mo tunes the local atomic configuration of highest occupied molecular orbital to trap holes produced under photoexcitation within picoseconds. Moreover, the incorporated site&#8208;specific Mo greatly improves the lifetime and diffusion length of photogenerated holes and optimizes the driving force of alkoxy C&#9472;H activation, which are responsible for the excellent performance. This work marks a significant stride to enhance the utilization efficiency of holes for promoting photocatalytic C&#9472;H activation.

         <title>Coronal Complexation Induces Snowman&#8208;Shaped Janus Polymersome Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Snowman&#8208;like Janus polymersomes were produced in a simple, yet versatile two&#8208;step approach involving a plasticizing agent and a cationic polymer additive to complex with the charged polymersome. Shape transformation was driven by coronal complexation altering membrane structure, followed by segregation of the polymer additive to form a protruding bleb of the Janus polymersome.








Abstract
Engineering polymersome shape is a keen area of interest because minimal variations in polymersome properties can greatly affect the performance of nanoreactors, drug delivery vehicles, and more. Although methods to transform polymersome shapes have been evolving rapidly, limitations remain in the scope of applicable polymersome compositions and adaptability to engineer a desired shape. In this work, we developed a method utilizing cationic polymer additives and coronal complexation to transform charged spherical polymersomes into asymmetric Janus polymersomes. The resulting morphologies feature a hollow polymersome compartment conjoined to a protruding bleb consisting of the complexed polymer additive, which we propose forms via a dewetting process. This methodology provides enhanced shape control through adjustments in additive composition or plasticizer content, offering additional routes to engineering novel polymersome structures.

         <title>Spatially Engineering the Internal Microstructure of a Single Crystal via Nanoparticle Occlusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spatially controlled occlusion of polymeric nanoparticles into cuprous oxide (Cu2O) systematically alters lattice distortion, oxygen vacancy content, and catalytic efficiency in the resulting composite crystals, offering a robust framework for the development of advanced functional composite materials.








Abstract
Single crystals are characterized by their continuous, highly ordered atomic lattices. Therefore, introducing impurities or structural defects into their matrices presents a major challenge, particularly in a spatially&#8208;controlled manner. Herein, we demonstrate a nanoparticle occlusion approach that enables the microstructure of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) single crystals to be engineered in a tunable way. This is achieved by directly incorporating poly(glycerol monomethacrylate)51&#8208;block&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate)100 [G51&#8208;B100] diblock copolymer nanoparticles into growing Cu2O crystals, leading to the formation of G51&#8208;B100@Cu2O composite crystals with structural defects localized at the G51&#8208;B100/Cu2O interfaces. The spatial distribution of these defects can be systematically engineered, ranging from the surface region to the entire crystal. Remarkably, the G51&#8208;B100 occlusion endows the resulting composite crystals with excellent catalytic performance in dye degradation under dark conditions, with activity correlated to the extent of nanoparticle occlusion. This study offers a unique strategy to create interfacial defects in single crystals, imparting emerging functionalities to the resulting composites.

         <title>Integrative Lattice and Surface Engineering of Nanoscale Fe0 for Superior Dechlorination of Trichloroethene in Groundwater: Coordination in Reactivity, Selectivity, and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice and surface engineering strategy was employed to synthesize a novel core&#8208;shell nanomaterial for superior reductive dechlorination of trichloroethene. In this design, FeNi serves as the core and FeS as the shell. Core composition and shell properties interactively determine materials&#8217; performance, and the optimal material exhibited 242.7&#8208;fold higher reactivity and 81.2&#8208;fold greater selectivity compared to the unmodified counterpart.








Abstract
Nanoscale zero&#8208;valent iron (nFe0) materials hold great promise in environmental remediation, yet achieving high reactivity, selectivity, and stability in reduction remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here we address this challenge by employing Ni lattice and FeS surface engineering to fabricate novel nFe0&#8208;based nanomaterials (dubbed as FeNix@FeSy), featuring FeNi as the core and FeS as the shell. The FeNi5@FeS10 delivered approximately 242.7&#8208; and 81.2&#8208;times higher reactivity and selectivity, respectively, over unmodified nFe&#176; for the remediation of trichloroethene (TCE; a notorious environmental pollutant), while maintaining high stability in groundwater remediation. We found that the core composition (i.e., Ni/Fe ratio) of FeNix@FeSy primarily determined reactivity, governed by a tradeoff between the galvanic effect and lattice strain, while shell properties mainly controlled selectivity, despite some interactions between them. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the FeS surface served as a favorable adsorption site for TCE, and the low energy barriers (TS2, 0.19&#160;eV) of FeNi5@FeS10 facilitated the cleavage of the first chlorine from TCE. Moreover, the core&#8208;shell structure promoted electron transfer from the core to the shell and TCE. This integrative lattice and surface engineering strategy provides a new avenue for designing advanced functional materials for environmental remediation and beyond.

         <title>Strain Energy Induced Rotary Speed Acceleration in a Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy accelerates rotary speed in overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motors by tuning cycloparaphenylene loop size, preserving core structures. Strain energy variations drive hierarchical acceleration up to 389&#8208;fold. This study systematically reveals motor behavior under strain, offering new avenues for engineering light&#8208;driven nanomachines.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven molecular motors based on overcrowded alkenes represent a major type of molecular machines that are able to rotate unidirectionally. The regulation of the rotary speed without altering the core structure of a motor is crucial and remains a major challenge. In the present study, we reported that the rotary speed of molecular motors can be significantly enhanced by harnessing the strain energy of cycloparaphenylene (CPP). A series of molecular motors incorporated in CPP with varying sizes were synthesized, and their photochemical and thermal isomerization behaviors were meticulously examined using UV&#8211;vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The remarkable increase of the acceleration effect of the rotary speed with decreasing macrocycle sizes, up to 389&#8208;fold, can be attributed to the strain energy induced bending in the stator part, which reduces steric hindrance in the &#8220;fjord region&#8221; of the molecule, supported by a detailed computational study employing density functional theory. This work provides systematic insight into the behavior of molecular motors under strain energy, thereby paving the way for the application of motor&#8208;incorporating CPPs as a general strategy to accelerate the rotary speed of molecular motors.

         <title>Lattice Water Deprotonation Enables Potassium&#8208;Ion Chemistries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abnormal water deprotonation in a lattice has been predicted in a chained model by density functional theory calculations and further verified by isotropic tracing and experimental electrochemical investigations. The lattice water deprotonation reaction in the initial charging process enables thereafter reversible potassium&#8208;ion insertion/desertion.








Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is a key process in clean energy applications and usually occurs on the surface of catalytic materials. Here, we report the anomalous partial water splitting, namely, water deprotonation behavior within the lattice of hydrated materials modeled by Fe1&#8208;xMgx(C2O4) &#8226; 2H2O (x&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.25&#8211;0.43), which triggers the otherwise inactive framework into an excellent cathode material for potassium ion storage. Density functional theory suggests that redox&#8208;active lattice Fe sites can split crystal water into hydroxyls and hydrogens in the initial charge, rendering thereafter reversible K&#8208;ion chemistries, whereas lattice Mg sites are inactive but stabilize the entire framework. Our experiments validated the as&#8208;predicted electrochemical behavior, and the isotopic tracing unambiguously confirmed the hydrogen evolution from crystal water. This intriguing &#8220;water deprotonation in lattice&#8221; phenomenon may open a new path for the design of cathode materials by electrolysis&#8208;assisted electrochemistry.

         <title>Hydrogen Spillover&#8208;Induced Br&#248;nsted Acidity Enables Controllable Hydrocracking of Polyolefin Waste to Liquid Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni/NbOx nanorod catalyst enables efficient polyolefin hydrocracking, achieving 95% yield of liquid fuels (C5&#8211;20) under mild conditions. Operando spectroscopy and DFT reveal Br&#248;nsted acid sites, generated via hydrogen spillover, as key catalytic sites, exhibiting a near&#8208;linear correlation with hydrocracking activity.








Abstract
Efficient upcycling of polyolefin waste into liquid fuels remains challenging due to over&#8208;cracking and the lack of sufficient acidity in non&#8208;zeolitic catalysts. Here, we report a Ni/niobium oxide nanorod (Ni/NbOx) catalyst that achieves 95% selectivity to C5&#8211;20&#8203; alkanes at full polyethylene (PE) conversion under mild conditions (240&#160;&#176;C), with minimal gaseous products (4%). The catalyst reaches a high liquid fuel formation rate of 1274 gliquid&#8203; gNi&#8722;1&#8203; h&#8722;1, rivaling noble metal systems. Its performance is governed by the morphology and crystallinity of NbOx nanorods, which provide sufficient acidity without micropore confinement, mitigating diffusion limitations and over&#8208;cracking. Detailed operando infrared spectroscopy and computational studies reveal, for the first time, that Br&#248;nsted acid sites, generated in situ via hydrogen spillover on the (110) facet, are the key catalytic sites in niobium oxide&#8208;based catalysts. The density of these acid sites exhibits a linear correlation with hydrocracking activity. The catalyst also demonstrates high efficiency across diverse polyolefin feedstocks and excellent reusability, offering a scalable and cost&#8208;effective solution for plastic upcycling.

         <title>Why Does the Performance of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Electrocatalysts Decrease in Acidic Conditions?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts proceeds through electron injection into the &#960;* orbital, triggered by the hydrogenation of pyridinic nitrogen. By closely tracking the changes in the electronic state during the reaction, we have reported that the decrease in ORR activity in acidic electrolytes is due to the protonation of pyridinic nitrogen, which precedes its hydrogenation.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon has emerged as a promising low&#8208;cost and durable alternative to platinum catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, its catalytic activity decreases significantly in acidic electrolytes, limiting the practical applications. Here, we report the degradation mechanisms of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts, focusing on the acid&#8208;base equilibrium of pyridinic nitrogen (pyri&#8208;N), which serves the primary active site. We found that the electrochemical hydrogenation of pyri&#8208;N to pyri&#8208;NH, coupled with oxygen adsorption, is a critical process. Although this reaction occurs at higher potentials in basic electrolytes, it shifts to lower potentials in acidic environments due to the protonation and stabilization of pyri&#8208;N. These results demonstrate that the decrease of the catalytic activity in acidic electrolytes is tied to the basicity of pyri&#8208;N. By controlling the basicity of pyri&#8208;N, specifically its pKa, a guideline for enhancing the ORR and other electrode reactions has been established.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Targeted Protein Degradation: An Emerging Therapeutics Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has emerged as a powerful therapeutic approach, with numerous candidates molecules now advancing into clinical development. Recent innovations have incorporated nanoparticles to facilitate and enhance these degradation processes, yielding synergistic effects. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of nanoparticle&#8208;mediated targeted degradation, outlining recent advances, key challenges, and future opportunities to guide progress in this rapidly evolving field.








Abstract
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has emerged as a transformative therapeutic strategy for eliminating disease&#8208;associated proteins, with relevance across disorders ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration. Since its inception nearly two decades ago, TPD has attracted strong academic and commercial interest, with multiple candidates advancing into clinical trials. Despite this progress, the field faces persistent challenges, including limited solubility, poor cellular uptake, and unpredictable structure&#8211;activity relationship of small&#8208;molecule degraders, which complicate rational design. To address these limitations, alternative platforms such as nanoparticle&#8208;mediated protein degraders (NanoPDs) have gained attention. First reported 17 years ago, NanoPDs harness a diverse array of materials, degradation mechanisms, and linker chemistries to achieve protein clearance through novel pathways. Although promising, their clinical translation remains constrained by barriers such as lysosomal entrapment, protein corona formation, and biocompatibility concerns. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of nanoparticle&#8208;mediated TPD. We emphasize the design principles underlying nano&#8211;bio interfaces and explore the role of proximity&#8208;induced biology as a mechanism for orchestrating protein interactions. Finally, we highlight critical challenges and key questions that must be addressed to fully realize the therapeutic potential of NanoPDs.

         <title>Cyclic Trinuclear Units Based Covalent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Gold Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three copper cyclic trinuclear units (Cu&#8208;CTUs) based covalent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CMOFs) bearing affinity functional groups are prepared. It has been demonstrated that the integration of multiple adsorption strategies into porous adsorbents, including adsorption, chemical reduction, and photocatalytic reduction can boost the overall performance of gold recovery.








Abstract
The development of porous solids for gold recovery is highly desired from both an economical and environmental point of view; however, the design of solid adsorbents with high overall performance is still challenging. Herein, we designed three copper(I) cyclic trinuclear units, Cu(I)&#8208;CTUs, based covalent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CMOFs) by networking metal clusters with dynamic covalent linkages. These CMOFs deliver a high gold adsorption capacity of 3687&#160;mg g&#8722;1, ultra&#8208;fast adsorption kinetics (i.e., removal efficiency&#160;&gt;&#160;99% within&#160;20&#160;s), excellent selectivity and reusability. In addition, they can be readily used for gold extraction from e&#8208;waste. Owing to the rich redox properties of Cu&#8208;CTUs, these CMOFs show three sorption mechanisms including adsorption, chemical reduction and photocatalytic reduction. Interestingly, the gold&#8208;loaded CMOFs can be used as catalysts for hydration of alkynes to ketones with high yields (e.g., up to &#8764; 95% for 6 examples).

         <title>Enhancing Cold Adaptation of Bidomain Amylases by High&#8208;Throughput Computational Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uncovers molecular determinants of cold adaptation in bidomain amylases by combining MD simulations and biochemical assays, revealing that increased domain separation drives enhanced activity at low temperatures. Guided by this principle, high&#8208;throughput in silico linker screening of mesophilic psA was performed, yielding variant psA121 with a 3&#8208;fold activity boost at 0&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating a strategy for designing cold&#8208;adapted enzymes.








Abstract
Cold&#8208;adapted bidomain enzymes have the potential to foster industrial sustainability by reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite their allure, these benefits are unattainable, as the molecular basis of cold adaptation remains elusive, and there are no strategies to guide the acquisition of this behavior. To uncover principles of cold adaptation, we selected the cold&#8208;adapted Saccharophagus degradans amylase (sdA) and mesophilic Pseudomonas saccharophila amylase (psA) as model systems. Through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and biochemical assays, we found that sdA exhibits significantly greater interdomain separation between its catalytic domain (CD) and carbohydrate&#8208;binding module (CBM) at low temperatures. Therefore, we introduce the domain separation index metric to guide the in silico screening of 120 psA variants using high&#8208;throughput enzyme modeling. The highest&#8208;ranked variant, psA121, shows a 3&#8208;fold increase in relative activity over the wild type at 0 &#176;C. MD simulations suggest that psA121 achieves cold adaptation via helical linkers, which induce interdomain separation and enhance flexibility of the active site and binding loops via dynamic allostery, promoting substrate recruitment, binding, and catalysis at lower temperatures. This study highlights how domain separation contributes to cold adaptation in bidomain amylases and offers strategies for introducing such cold adaptation to other systems.

         <title>Cooperativity of Electron Transfer Coupled Spin Transitions in a Tetranuclear Fe/Co Prussian Blue Analogue Revealed by Ultrafast Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast pump&#8208;probe spectroscopies show that irradiation of a square Fe/Co Prussian blue analogue induces electron transfer within one Fe&#8211;Co subunit followed by fast spin crossover, and coupled equilibria between all states trigger a second electron transfer coupled to spin crossover in the other Fe&#8211;Co subunit on a ns timescale. This represents a unique case of cooperative two&#8208;step switching on a molecular level.








Abstract
Cooperative intermolecular interactions, usually observed in solid state, can confer useful properties to stimuli&#8211;responsive spin transition materials. Here, we demonstrate for the first time intramolecular cooperativity between the two Fe&#8211;Co subunits of a molecular cyanido&#8208;bridged square Fe2Co2 Prussian blue analogue (PBA) in solution, which upon single photon excitation sequentially undergo electron transfer coupled spin transition (ETCST) from a diamagnetic low&#8208;spin (LS) to a paramagnetic high&#8208;spin (HS) state. Ultrafast UV&#8211;vis and IR pump&#8208;probe spectroscopies show that irradiation into the IVCT band of the LS state induces electron transfer within one Fe&#8211;Co subunit followed by fast (360 fs) SCO to an intermediate HS/LS species and a further ETCST event in the other Fe&#8211;Co subunit then occurs on a ns timescale. Kinetic analysis reveals that this cooperative switching of the two Fe&#8211;Co subunits is caused by two coupled equilibria favouring the second ETCST step, and the free energy landscape for the square Fe2Co2 system is determined experimentally.

         <title>Supramolecular Ion Channels to Engineer Zn2+ Ion Transport Mediated Chemical&#8208;to&#8208;Optical Signal Transduction</title>

         <dc:description>
A molecular communication system has been developed to monitor Zn2+ ion transport&#8208;mediated chemical&#8208;to&#8208;optical signal amplification process.








Abstract
Artificial ion channels have significant potential for various applications, including molecular communication, bio&#8208;sensing, and constructing artificial cells. In this report, we demonstrated the development of a molecular communication system that transports ions across the lipid bilayers via the formation of supramolecular ion channels and harnesses chemical reactions to overcome the challenges of executing signal&#8208;processing functions at the molecular level. The potent ionophore self&#8208;assembles into nanochannels within the lipid bilayers and selectively transports Zn2+ ions. The movement of Zn2+ ions through these supramolecular ion channels enables the in situ generation of a water&#8208;soluble catalytic system with tyrosine. This catalytic system promotes esterase&#8208;like activity, generating fluorescent reporters from non&#8208;fluorescent ester&#8208;based compounds within the intravesicular environment. Furthermore, this process indicates the formation of a three&#8208;input AND logic gate in the fluorescence mode, allowing the monitoring of the chemical&#8208;to&#8208;optical signal amplification process akin to biological counterparts. Developing these molecular communication systems to replicate the complexity of natural cellular processes opens up exciting opportunities for designing advanced biomimetic tools and exploring the fundamental principles underlying cellular communication.

         <title>An Enzymatic Platform for Asymmetric Synthesis of Si&#8208;Stereogenic Silanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered P450 enzymes were employed to catalyze the asymmetric oxidation of dihydrosilanes, producing Si&#8208;stereogenic chiral silanols with good yields and high enantioselectivies. The evolved variant ASOx&#8208;6 exhibits a 54&#8208;fold activity increase compared to the wild&#8208;type enzyme on the model substrate. A combination of experimental and computational mechanistic studies provided detailed insights into this biocatalytic process.








Abstract
Chiral silanols are important synthetic targets and have garnered increasing attention in the materials and pharmaceutical industries over recent decades. A promising approach for their efficient synthesis is asymmetric silane oxidation. While chemists have developed several transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed systems for asymmetric hydrolytic oxidation of silanes, no biocatalytic methods have been available for enantioselective synthesis of Si&#8208;stereogenic compounds, including chiral silanols. Here, we present an enzymatic platform for the asymmetric aerobic mono&#8208;oxidation of dihydrosilanes using an engineered P450BM3 enzyme. Through six iterative rounds of directed evolution, we identified the optimal evolved variant, ASOx&#8208;6, which exhibits a 54&#8208;fold improvement in kcat/KM compared with the wild&#8208;type enzyme. Moreover, a variety of aryl&#8211;alkyl substituted dihydrosilanes are accepted by ASOx&#8208;6, including those bearing heteroaromatic rings. Finally, mechanistic insights obtained from kinetic isotope experiments and computational studies further elucidate the nature of this biocatalytic transformation.

         <title>Leveraging Sortase A Electrostatics for Powerful Transpeptidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sortase&#8208;mediated transpeptidation is a powerful biochemical reaction to perform protein engineering. In this work, we leverage the unique electrostatic profile of sortase A pentamutant (SrtA&#8208;5M) to improve SrtA&#8208;5M&#8208;mediated transpeptidations by incorporating short, charged peptidic modules into the substrates. Importantly, the reaction proceeds with a minimal excess of nucleophile and is fast and highly efficient in the low micromolar substrate concentration range. Electrostatic assistance eliminates the need for additives or complex substrate engineering strategies, thereby giving it a broad scope. Our findings also provide fundamental insights into the influence of substrate charge on SrtA&#8208;5M activity, paving the way for further optimization of SrtA&#8208;catalyzed transpeptidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Anti&#8208;parallel &#946;&#8208;Sheet as a Key Motif of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Inhibitor Designed via Topological Peptide Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aggregation of amyloidogenic intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) such as amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) is associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Peptide inhibitors targeting A&#946; peptide represents a promising strategy to disrupt its pathogenic self&#8208;assembly. Conventional inhibitor design primarily mimics repetitive sequences found in fibrillar A&#946; assemblies. However, since the structural dynamics of A&#946; involves in the early&#8208;stage oligomerization, its conformational flexibility should be considered in sequence&#8208;based design principle. Herein, we introduce topological reprogramming of peptide inhibitors to induce the structural transformation in pathogenic A&#946; 1&#8211;42 (A&#946;42). The eleven&#8208;residue peptide scaffold Pa11 (14HQKLVNFAEDV24) identified through the initial screening was dimerized via a disulfide bond. The dimerization stabilizes local A&#946;42 structures by promoting anti&#8208;parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet conformations in the scaffolds, thereby significantly suppressing A&#946;42 aggregation. Our approach underscores that conformational features of IDPs can be modulated through the modification in peptide connectivity, suggesting a novel strategy for A&#946;&#8208;targeted peptide building block.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacing B&#8208;DNA and DNA Mimic Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A linker unit was designed and synthesized that can serve both as a hairpin turn in a DNA duplex and anchor point for an aromatic helical foldamer mimicking the shape and surface properties of B&#8208;DNA. Methods were developed to synthesize natural/non&#8208;natural chimeric molecules combining foldamer and DNA segments. The ability of the linker to position the foldamer helix and the duplex DNA so that their rims and grooves are in register, despite their completely different chemical nature, was demonstrated using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, circular dichroism and molecular models. Bio&#8208;layer interferometry confirmed that artificial hairpin DNA duplexes keep their ability to bind to DNA binding proteins. The chimeric molecules may pave the way to competitive inhibitors of protein&#8208;DNA interactions involving sequence&#8208;selective DNA&#8208;binding proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>From Amino Acids to &#945;&#8208;Keto Acids via &#946;&#8208;Elimination and Transamination Initiates a Pathway to Prebiotic Reaction Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Keto acids, such as pyruvate and glyoxylate, may have been critical in generating reaction networks at the origins of life due to their facile carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation and their hydrolytic stability. However, demonstrated prebiotic sources of these small &#945;&#8208;keto acids have been limited by conditions required for their production which are not conducive for subsequent incorporation or transition into (proto)metabolic pathways. Here, we demonstrate an abiotic generation of &#945;&#8208;keto acids from only two amino acids starting with the phosphorylation and dehydration of serine, coupled with a transamination with glycine, to produce both pyruvate and glyoxylate. This triggers an in&#8208;situ reaction pathway producing higher&#8208;order &#945;&#8208;keto acids including amino acid precursors found in modern biology. These findings may help elucidate how protometabolic chemical networks can emerge on the early Earth under mild aqueous conditions leading to a coupled amino acid&#8211;&#945;&#8208;keto acid chemical system capable of supporting a more robust metabolism.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Construction of Asymmetrically Coordinated PtCuZn Trimetallic Atom Catalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With advancements in the study of catalysts at atomic sites, the unique and predictable characteristics of atomic models have enabled the exploration of catalysts with monoatomic, diatomic, and polymetallic centers. In this study, a platinum&#8208;copper&#8208;zinc trimetallic catalyst (named PtCuZn/SNC) was synthesized by the spatial confinement method and polymer coating method. This triatomic catalyst facilitates electronic interaction and charge redistribution among the three metal atoms, optimizing the adsorption and desorption of reaction intermediates and thereby exhibiting excellent performance in acidic oxygen reduction reaction. In the oxygen reduction reaction test, a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.859 V and an impressive energy density of 532 mW cm&#8208;2 were achieved in fuel cell tests, demonstrating the outstanding catalytic performance of the catalyst.These findings suggest that the design and synthesis of monodisperse triatomic catalysts provide a promising route to improve the efficiency of H2/O2 fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Porous Coordination Cages for Sonodynamic Therapy: Enhanced Efficacy through Atomic Precision and Immune Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a promising non&#8208;invasive approach for immunotherapy; However, its broad applicability is often limited by the inefficiency of sonosensitizers. In this study, we introduce a novel series of porous coordination cages (PCCs) specifically engineered to enhance sonodynamic therapeutic performance for the first time. These PCCs incorporate energy harvesting and conversion components, with variations in bandgap, electrical conductivity, and redox activity. Characterized by atomically precise compositions and well&#8208;defined structures, the PCCs enable strategic manipulation of functionalized moieties and metal centers, allowing for precise control over their sonodynamic efficiency. Their small particle size enhances penetration through dense tumor extracellular matrices, significantly improving tumor permeability. Upon ultrasound stimulation, the PCCs exhibit robust sonodynamic effects, resulting in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in tumor cells, which triggers apoptosis and antigens release. Notably, PCC&#8208;1 demonstrates metal&#8208;mediated catalytic activity, converting endogenous hydrogen peroxide into additional ROS, synergistically enhancing SDT efficacy and activating the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway in dendritic cells. In tumor&#8208;bearing mice, PCCs effectively inhibited tumor growth and activated immune responses both locally and systemically. Collectively, these findings underscore the exceptional sonodynamic&#8208;immunotherapeutic potential of PCCs, paving the way for innovative strategies in tumor treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>A Core&#8208;shell Structured Argyrodite&#8208;type Electrolyte Enabling Elevated Chemical/Electrochemical Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfide solid electrolytes hold great promise in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries owing to high ionic conductivity and good formability. However, their poor chemical/electrochemical stability imposes limitations on further large&#8208;scale application. In this study, a versatile solid electrolyte (SE) is finely crafted with the core of Cl&#8208;gradient argyrodite structure and the shell of LiCl layer. Leveraging LiCl shell as a &#8220;reservoir&#8221;, this argyrodite SE preserves the structure integrity and good Li+ conduction upon air exposure, exhibiting remarkable chemical stability. Moreover, Li+ transport from argyrodite bulk and surface is synergistically enhanced through the specific surface engineering strategy, resulting in an exceptionally high ionic conductivity of 10.62 mS cm&#8208;1. The LiCl shell, characterized by favorable electron shielding and lithiophobicity, enables the core&#8208;shell argyrodite with impressive electrochemical stability over a wide voltage range (0~5 V vs Li/Li+) and good match for Li metal. As the electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility is optimized by engineering LiCl layer on SE, LiCoO2 cathode paired with CS&#8208;LPSC SE retains a remarkable capacity retention of 95.6% over 500 cycles at 1 C.</dc:description>

As the electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility is optimized by engineering LiCl layer on SE, LiCoO2 cathode paired with CS-LPSC SE retains a remarkable capacity retention of 95.6% over 500 cycles at 1 C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nucleophilic Covalent Ligands Enable Simultaneous Surface Reconstruction and Passivation of Colloidal InSb Quantum Dots for Stable Short&#8208;wave Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indium antimonide (InSb) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising candidates for short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors due to their large Bohr exciton radius and tunable bandgap in the 0.6&#8208;1.3 eV range. However, the formation of metal oxides on InSb surfaces during synthesis impedes charge transport, necessitating CQD resurfacing strategies for integration into photodetectors. Previous reports achieved progress in device efficiency by resurfacing these CQDs with acid&#8208;halide sequential treatments, but the device operating stability remains unsatisfactory. Herein we report a solution&#8208;phase strategy for surface reconstruction and passivation of InSb CQDs using sulfur&#8208;based nucleophilic covalent ligands. We find that short&#8208;chain thiol molecules remove surface metal oxides through nucleophilic attack and enable robust passivation of In and Sb via strong covalent bonds, whereas metal sulfides are less effective at oxide removal and passivation. Consequently, the thiolate&#8208;passivated CQDs exhibit a tenfold decrease in trap state density compared to controls, and remain structurally and optically stable for 5 months. We demonstrate InSb CQD SWIR photodetectors that realize a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 28% at 1450 nm, with the highest operating stability among reported CQD SWIR photodetectors, retaining 95% of performance following 300 h of biased and illuminated operation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic exchange reactions as self&#8208;blowing agents for reprocessable foams production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermosetting foams are crucial in the polymer industry due to their unique lightweight and durable properties. Recent developments in sustainable chemistry intend to align foam lifecycle towards circular economy principles and reduce their environmental impact. In this study, this issue is addressed thanks to an innovative and straightforward approach, enabling the manufacture of single component self&#8208;blowing vitrimer foam. The self&#8208;blowing mechanism originates from the in&#8208;situ formation and release of the blowing agent via the polycondensation of an alkylester. This alkylester, composed of a benzoxazine matrix terminated with a &#946;&#8208;hydroxylamine, undergoes in a cascade mechanism ring opening polymerization (ROP) and irreversible transesterification exchange, which in turn generates an alcohol gas. The cascade polymerization and alcohol release were optimized and fine&#8208;tuned to develop various foams that have an open&#8208;cell morphology, volume expansion as of 223&#8208;853 %, porosity as of 67&#8208;86 %, and compression modulus in the range of 3 to 38 MPa. The polymerization process results in a dual crosslinked poly(benzoxazine&#8208;co&#8208;ester) network composed of &#946;&#8208;hydroxylamine moieties, alkyl&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;aminoester bonds, enabling reversible transesterification dynamic exchanges and mechanical reprocessability, achieving a foam&#8208;to&#8208;resin reprocessing.</dc:description>

         <title>Natural Sunlight&#8208;Driven Activation of Inert Aryl Halides Using Plasmonic Cu@CdS with Polysulfide Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemists have long aspired to construct complex organic compounds the way that plants do by harnessing natural sunlight as an energy source. This study presents an advancement toward this goal via synergistic exploitation of the plasmonic absorption of Cu and the unique redox potentials of excited polysulfide species (S3&#8226;&#8722; and S42&#8722;) on semiconductor surfaces to decouple the thermodynamic limits of photoreduction from photoexcitation.








Abstract
Visible light photoredox catalysis has become a rapidly emerging area owing to its potential of using sunlight to tame previously hard&#8208;to&#8208;harness radicals for organic synthesis. At present, such a blueprint faces a significant challenge, namely how to accomplish thermodynamically demanding reactions with sunlight encompassing a wide range of low&#8208;energy photons. Here, we report a new reaction framework to overcome this bottleneck through decoupling the thermodynamic limits of photoreduction from photoexcitation. This is fulfilled based on the construction of a heterogeneous photocatalyst Cu@CdS possessing in situ&#8208;formed surficial polysulfide species (including S3&#8226;&#8722; and S42&#8722;), which can efficiently harvest solar energy via plasmonic absorption of Cu while manifest sufficient redox potential for activating inert aryl bromides/chlorides enacted by excited polysulfides. We demonstrate that this designed material composes a potent photoredox catalyst for efficient aryl cross&#8208;coupling, borylation, hydrogenation, as well as Birch&#8208;type dearomatization reactions, with good recyclability and stability. In particular, when exclusively using natural sunlight as an energy source, the product yield can still reach up to 90%. Our findings introduce a straightforward yet viable way to progress toward the century&#8208;long dream of leveraging natural sunlight to produce structurally complex organic molecules, just like plants on Earth.

         <title>Unprecedented Tetravalent Uranium Photocatalysts for Efficient C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) Bond Cleavage and Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

We report the discovery of the first tetravalent uranium photocatalyst that efficiently enables C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond cleavage and formation under visible light, providing a new platform for uranium&#8208;based photocatalysis and bond functionalization.








Abstract
Photocatalysis is a pivotal area in synthetic chemistry. Despite extensive application potential in nuclear industry, uranium&#8208;based photocatalysts are historically limited to uranyl(VI/V) redox cycle. Here, we report the discovery of the first tetravalent uranium [U(IV)] photocatalyst that enables efficient C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond cleavage and formation under ideal visible light. The U(IV) alkoxy species mediates C&#9472;C bond cleavage in a wide range of cycloalkanols and promotes their coupling with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, providing access to previously unattainable molecular architectures. These U(IV) alkoxy complexes, fully characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction and magnetic studies, exhibit exceptional photocatalytic efficiency. Quantum chemical studies reveal that the energy barrier for C&#9472;C bond cleavage and formation is reduced to below 10 kcal &#183; mol&#8722;1 under visible light excitation. This work introduces a new mechanistic paradigm for uranium&#8208;based photocatalysis and positions U(IV) alkoxy complexes as a versatile platform for bond activation and functionalization, expanding the potential applications of depleted uranium in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Local Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Oxygen Exchange for Active and Durable Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to enhance OER activity and durability by tailoring pseudo&#8208;amorphous IrOx with a locally ordered rutile structure and unique defects is developed. The generated defect&#8208;active sites afford the oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated oxygen exchange process with favorable O&#9472;O bonding and efficient lattice oxygen recovery, presenting a 2200&#160;h stability at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1.68&#160;V at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 1000&#160;h in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. 








Abstract
Developing an active and durable acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst is vital for implementing a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) in sustainable hydrogen production. However, it remains dauntingly challenging to balance high activity and long&#8208;term stability under harsh acidic and oxidizing conditions. Herein, through developing the universal rare&#8208;earth participated pyrolysis&#8208;leaching approach, we customized the active and long lifespan pseudo&#8208;amorphous IrOx with locally ordered rutile IrO2 and unique defect sites (IrOx&#8208;3Nd). IrOx&#8208;3Nd achieved a low overpotential of 206&#160;mV and long&#8208;term durability of 2200&#160;h with a slow degradation rate of 0.009&#160;mV&#8201;&#160;h&#8722;1 at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and, more importantly, high efficiency in PEMWE (1.68&#160;V at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 1000&#160;h) for practical hydrogen production. Utilizing in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, we found that lattice oxygen vacancies (Ov) and contracted Ir&#8208;O in locally ordered rutile IrO2 induced the Ov&#8208;modulated lattice oxygen exchange process, wherein thermodynamically spontaneous occupation of surface hydroxyl groups on Ov and effective promotion of O&#9472;O coupling and lattice oxygen recovery accounted for enhanced activity and durability. This work underscores the importance of tailor&#8208;made local configuration in boosting activity and durability of OER catalyst and different insights into the promotion mechanism.

         <title>Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes With Semi&#8208;Solvated Hexafluoroisopropyl Methyl Ether Diluent for Wide&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Range Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lithiophilic and lithiophobic groups in hexafluoroisopropyl methyl ether diluent can sustain rapid Li&#8314; transport and anion&#8211;cation aggregates enrichment in LHCEs. The accelerated Li&#8314; transport, desolvation kinetics, and the formed robust SEI endow Li||LiFePO4 cell with the capacity retention of 92.2% after 150 cycles at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C and 91.3% after 60 cycles at 65&#160;&#176;C. The Li||NCM811 pouch cell delivers the capacity retention of 91.6% after 75 cycles.








Abstract
Conventional electrolytes in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) suffer from irreversible interfacial degradation at elevated temperatures and sluggish Li&#8314; desolvation/transport kinetics under cryogenic conditions. Herein, we present an innovative semi&#8208;solvated hexafluoroisopropyl methyl ether (HFME) diluent in localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) that strategically addresses these limitations. Li&#8314; hopping networks within the electrolyte can be preserved even at low temperatures due to the coordination of lithiophilic groups in HFME molecules with Li&#8314;. Simultaneously, lithiophobic group induced spatial confinement effects promote the formation of anion&#8211;cation aggregates (AGGs), significantly optimizing Li&#8314; desolvation kinetics and boosting the formation of inorganic&#8208;dominated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with exceptional thermal stability. Li||LiFePO4 (LFP) cell with the diluent&#8208;coordinated LHCEs (DCL) can deliver 125.4&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 initial capacity at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C with 92.2% retention after 150 cycles. Under elevated temperatures (65&#160;&#176;C), the DCL&#8208;based Li||LFP cell can maintain the capacity retention of 91.3% over 60 cycles. The Li||NCM811 pouch cell (10&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;6.5&#160;cm, capacity: 1000&#160;mA&#160;h) based on the DCL exhibits outstanding cycling stability, retaining 91.6% of its initial capacity after 75 cycles. This work pioneers a solvent chemistry paradigm through spatially modulated solvation structures, establishing fundamental design principles for electrolyte for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range LMBs.

         <title>Enzymatic Amination for Stereocontrolled Functionalization of Cyclohexanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient biocatalytic platform has been established for the synthesis of cis/trans and axial chiral cyclohexylamines with excellent stereoselectivity, high yield, and a broad substrate scope. The industrial applicability of this biocatalytic approach was exemplified through 10g&#8208;scale preparative reactions and the chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of key intermediates for the 11&#946;&#8208;HSD1 inhibitors AM&#8208;7715.








Abstract
Functionalizing the symmetric carbonyl carbon of cyclohexanone to achieve stereocontrol, resulting in saturated cyclohexanes with either cis/trans or axial stereochemistry, poses significant challenges in chemical synthesis, and existing methodologies are limited. In this study, we present an enzymatic reductive amination strategy to attain this objective. By engineering the enzyme pocket of the sole imine reductase (IRED) M5, we successfully synthesized over 80 cis/trans and axially chiral 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexylamines in a stereo&#8208;complementary fashion, adhering to industrial standards, via the reductive amination of 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones. Mechanistically, the reshaping of the enzyme pocket allows the optimized variants to distinguish between different imine precursors and selectively bind their specific configurations with favorable binding energies, thereby facilitating the generation of stereochemically distinct products. We propose that this stereocontrolled&#8208;functionalization strategy could be extended to a broader range of cyclohexylamines with diverse substituents.

         <title>Unexpected redox role of WO3 in V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 catalysts for selective reduction of NO by forming V&#8208;W dinuclear sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Promoters can greatly improve the activity of catalysts; however, the mechanism by which they interact with the primary catalyst to enhance catalytic activity is not always clear. It has been widely demonstrated that WO3 in V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 catalysts acts as a promoter to enhance the surface acidity and regulate the dispersion of active V2O5 species, while it is believed that the redox process takes place entirely at the V sites in the selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 (NH3&#8208;SCR). Here, by combining in situ spectroscopic measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we validate that the WO3 directly participates in the oxidative activation of NH3, and hence explicitly exerts a redox effect in NH3&#8208;SCR by forming V&#8208;W dinuclear sites with V2O5. This study sheds new light on a long&#8208;standing puzzle regarding the role of WO3 as a promoter and hence advances the understanding of the working principle of V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Reductive Arylation and Alkenylation of Sulfinylamines to Access Sulfinamides Enabled by Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method for the enantioselective reductive arylation and alkenylation of sulfinylamines was developed, yielding enantiopure aryl and alkenyl sulfinamides with high efficiency. Mechanistic insights indicate that migratory insertion into the sulfilimine group is crucial for enantioselectivity.








Abstract
This study reports a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method for the enantioselective reductive arylation and alkenylation of sulfinylamines, facilitating the efficient synthesis of enantiopure sulfinamides. By employing a cobalt/chiral diphosphine and tridentate ligand system, a range of diverse aryl and alkenyl iodides were successfully transformed into sulfinamides, achieving high yields and excellent enantioselectivity. This methodology underscores the utility of sulfinylamines as versatile electrophilic sulfur sources. Detailed mechanistic insights from density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the key step involves migratory insertion into the sulfilimine group, which plays a crucial role in enantioselectivity. These findings offer a sustainable approach for the development of biologically relative enantiopure sulfur&#8208;containing compounds.

         <title>2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Electrocatalysts for Boosting Glycerol Upgrading Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D conjugated [Ni3(HHTQ)2]n MOF (HHTQ = 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline) with Ni&#8211;O4 node can be simultaneously utilised as a catalyst for glycerol oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, showing high catalytic activity and selectivity. The in situ measurements and theoretical calculations reveal the reaction mechanism, active centres, and origin of outstanding performance.








Abstract
The valorisation of glycerol using renewable electricity is recognised as an effective and attractive approach for producing high&#8208;value compounds from biomass byproducts. 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as promising electrocatalysts due to their tunable structures, high electronic conductivity, and efficient utilisation of well&#8208;defined active centres. In this study, we report the first systematic investigation of 2D c&#8208;MOFs containing Ni&#8208;X4 (X&#160;=&#160;O or N) moieties for the glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), examining key factors influencing both electrocatalytic activity and selectivity. In situ 13C electrochemical nuclear magnetic resonance and Raman spectroscopies provide insights into the GOR mechanism and confirm that Ni&#8211;O4 sites are the primary active centres. Theoretical calculations further reveal that [Ni3(HHTQ)2]n (HHTQ = 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline) exhibits superior GOR activity due to strong adsorption of reaction intermediates and weak interlayer interactions. This work highlights the potential of 2D c&#8208;MOFs as highly efficient GOR catalysts, paving the way for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts and contributing to the development of sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies.

         <title>Functional Ambidexterity of an Ancient Nucleic Acid&#8208;Binding Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (HhH)2&#8208;Fold is an ancient and ubiquitous nucleic acid&#8208;binding domain. We demonstrate that this domain, which interacts with the minor groove of dsDNA, is functionally ambidextrous &#8211; that it can bind to dsDNA of either chirality. Moreover, binding of both chiral forms of dsDNA is mediated by an overlapping binding surface. These results reveal new insights into the evolution of the (HhH)2&#8208;Fold and its mode of binding. 








Abstract
The helix&#8208;hairpin&#8208;helix (HhH) motif is an ancient and ubiquitous nucleic acid&#8208;binding element that has emerged as a model system for studying the evolution of dsDNA&#8208;binding domains from simple peptides that phase separate with RNA. We analyzed the entire putative evolutionary trajectory of the HhH motif &#8211; from a flexible peptide to a folded domain &#8211; for functional robustness to total chiral inversion. Against expectations, functional &#8220;ambidexterity&#8221; was observed for both the phase separation of HhH peptides with RNA and binding of the duplicated (HhH)2&#8208;Fold to dsDNA. Moreover, dissociation kinetics, mutational analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations revealed an overlap between the binding modes adopted by the natural and mirror&#8208;image proteins to natural dsDNA. The similarity of several dissociation phases upon chiral inversion may reflect the history of (HhH)2&#8208;Fold binding, with the ultimate emergence of a high&#8208;affinity binding mode, supported by a bridging metal ion, depopulating but not displacing more primitive (potentially ambidextrous) modes. These data underscore the surprising functional robustness of the HhH protein family and suggest that the veil between worlds with alternative chiral preferences may not be as impenetrable as is often assumed.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Basicity Diverts the Site&#8208;Selectivity of Aromatic Deuteration: Application to the Late&#8208;Stage Labeling of Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a metal&#8208;free method for aromatic deuterium labeling via photoexcitation in deuterated HFIP. This approach leverages the enhanced basicity of excited&#8208;state aromatics to achieve selective hydrogen isotope exchange at challenging positions. Demonstrated on complex drug molecules, this efficient strategy provides a valuable tool for isotope labeling, with mechanistic insights confirmed by transient absorption spectroscopy.








Abstract
Isotope labeling, particularly with deuterium (2H), plays a critical role in drug discovery due to its ease of incorporation and its potential to switch unwanted metabolic transformations. Deuterium incorporation can enhance drug stability, affect pharmacokinetics, and alter metabolism pathways. Current deuterium labeling methods focus on hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE), and typically rely on the use of transition metal catalysis. Herein, we present a metal&#8208;free approach for aromatic HIE, utilizing photoexcitation in deuterated hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP&#8208;d1). By exploiting the enhanced basicity of excited&#8208;state aromatics, this method achieves selective deuteration at positions often inaccessible by traditional methods. The approach is efficient and was demonstrated across a broad number of complex drug molecules. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms the formation of deuterated arenium ions.

To address this challenge, this study proposes a lattice compression strategy in which electronic localization accelerates the CO2RR, thereby enhancing Ir&#8208;O coupling and inducing the formation of low&#8208;crystallinity Li2CO3, ultimately optimizing the CO2ER process. This approach enables the Li&#8208;CO2 battery to achieve an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 0.33 V and an exceptionally high energy efficiency of ~88.7%. Moreover, even after over 1100 hours of operation, the battery maintains a stable charging potential of 3.3 V, representing the best performance reported to date. Through in situ and ex situ characterizations combined with theoretical calculations, we reveal that lattice compression leads to changes in the coordination environment, thereby enhancing electronic localization effects. This accelerates Li+ migration near the catalyst surface, facilitating its rapid participation in CO2RR. Subsequently, the strengthened Ir&#8208;O coupling modulates the symmetry of Li2CO3 molecules, reduces their crystallinity, and ultimately promotes their efficient decomposition. This study provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance bidirectional cathode catalysts through crystal facet engineering.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Here, we report a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) synthesis of a fully organic ladder polymer via topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Phase Boundaries Enable Selective Urea Production From Simulated Flue Gas in a Zero&#8208;Gap Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and NO3&#8315; presents a promising route for sustainable urea production. Here, we show that in situ generated CO2 bubbles within a bi(carbonate) reduction zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer can boost urea selectivity by engendering a high density of triple&#8208;phase boundaries.








Abstract
Renewable energy&#8208;powered co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and NO3&#8722; offers a promising pathway toward sustainable urea production. However, achieving high urea selectivity is challenging due to substantial competing side reactions. Here, we show that engendering a high density of CO2 bubbles on the catalyst surface creates numerous triple&#8208;phase boundaries that are key toward enhancing CO2 versus NO3&#8722; availability for selective urea production. We implemented this strategy using a bipolar membrane in a zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer, which allows for the in situ conversion of (bi)carbonate to CO2 bubbles at the catalyst/electrolyte interface. Notably, we demonstrate that this electrolyzer system can utilize simulated flue gas (20% CO2&#160;+&#160;5% O2) for urea production. With a Cu95Ru5 catalyst, we achieve a urea Faradaic efficiency of 58% at 2&#160;V full&#8208;cell voltage over an extended 30&#8208;h period and a peak production rate of 35.46&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gcat&#8722;1. Under these conditions, the Faradaic efficiency to hydrogen evolution and nitrate reduction are 14.7% and 21.6%, respectively. Strikingly, these results with simulated flue gas are comparable to previously reported systems that employ pure CO2. Our results introduce a simple yet effective design approach toward developing efficient electrolyzer systems for urea production.

         <title>An Artificial Metal&#8208;Free Peroxidase Designed Using a Ferritin Cage for Bioinspired Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing artificial enzymes remains challenging due to the need for precise active site control. Here, we present a simple strategy to create metal&#8208;free artificial enzymes by engineering Histidine clusters inside a ferritin cage. The resulting catalyst mimics peroxidase activity, and its stable cage structure offers new insights into supramolecular catalysis, opening avenues for bioinspired catalyst development. 








Abstract
Developing artificial enzymes is challenging because it requires precise design of active sites with well&#8208;arranged amino acid residues. Histidine&#8208;rich oligopeptides have been recently shown to exhibit peroxidase&#8208;mimetic activities, but their catalytic function relies on maintaining unique supramolecular structures. This work demonstrates the design of a specific array of histidine residues on the internal surface of the ferritin cage to function as an active center for catalysis. The crystal structures of the ferritin mutants revealed histidine&#8211;histidine interactions, forming well&#8208;defined histidine clusters (His&#8208;clusters). These mutants exhibit peroxidase&#8208;mimetic activities by oxidizing 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Molecular dynamics simulations further highlight the co&#8208;localization of TMB and hydrogen peroxide at the histidine&#8208;rich clusters, indicating that the confined environment of the ferritin cage enhances their interactions. This study presents a simple yet effective approach to design metal&#8208;free artificial enzymes, paving the way for innovations in bioinspired catalysis.

         <title>Understanding the Position Effects of Monoatom Doping in Silver Nanoclusters on Oxygen Reduction by Single Entity Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed single entity collision electrochemistry method to investigate the oxygen reduction behaviors of single monoatom&#8208;doped bimetallic M1Ag24 (M&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au, Pt, and Cu) nanoclusters. Our experimental findings and theoretical calculations reveal the electrocatalytic reaction dynamics associated with the intracluster migration of the Au monoatom during the dynamic alloying process of Au1Ag24 nanoclusters.








Abstract
Alloying nanoclusters (NCs) with monoatom doping represents an effective strategy to enhance catalytic performances due to the synergistic interactions between the dopant and host atoms. However, in&#8208;depth understanding the position effects of monoatom doping within alloying NCs, particularly at the atomic level, remains elusive. Here, we employed single entity collision electrochemistry method to investigate the electrocatalytic behaviors of individual monoatom&#8208;doped bimetallic M1Ag24 (M&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au, Pt, and Cu) NCs toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). By relying on high&#8208;resolution and high&#8208;throughput electrochemical measurements, we successfully discriminated the effects of monoatom variation in M1Ag24 NCs on ORR activity at the single atom resolution and identified different M1Ag24 NCs across characteristic populations. Our experimental findings and theoretical calculations reveal the electrocatalytic reaction dynamics associated with intracluster migration of Au monoatom during the dynamic alloying process of Au1Ag24 NCs. This work demonstrates a novel approach for in situ identifying the position effects of foreign doping atoms on the electrocatalytic activity of alloy NCs at the single atom level.

In this work, two cases of alkali metal guanidine&#8208;formates 1Na and 2K were synthesized by combining cationic regulation and &#960;&#8208;conjugated units, where 1Na maintains large birefringence while overcoming the layered growth habit. The evaluation of 1Na from synthesis to growth to preliminary optical devices was completed, and its optical properties, strong interlayer interaction, and the source of crystal structure stability were analyzed through theoretical calculations.








Abstract
The light polarization modulation involves the capacity to respond selectively to light&#8208;mater interaction and is dependent on the optical anisotropy of crystalline materials. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated component is almost typically utilized to produce such materials in the short&#8208;wave ultraviolet region; however, the conflicting link between high optical anisotropy and strong layered habit is difficult to reconcile. As a result, many anisotropic crystals are limited to tiny crystals rather than processing optical devices. This study designs crystals with beneficial but easy&#8208;to&#8208;grow layered structure and strong optical anisotropy by bridging the interlayer binding to ordered &#960;&#8208;conjugated units. To this end, two new hybrid crystals Na2[C(NH2)3][HCOO]3 (1Na) and K2[C(NH2)3][HCOO]3 (2K) are reported by combining cationic regulation and &#960;&#8208;conjugated units. The strong interlayer interaction and stable crystal structure of 1Na have been found to be caused by the orbital hybridization and Lewis acidity of Na+ and [HCOO] groups. This allows for the easy growth of centimeter&#8208;large, high optical quality 1Na single crystals, providing crystal assurance for all&#8208;around testing for a practical crystal. Using the most accurate minimal deviation angle method, the birefringence is measured to be 0.174&#8211;0.258 @253&#8208;1013&#160;nm, surpassing all reported crystals with the same components of [HCOO] or [C(NH2)3] in the applied short&#8208;wave ultraviolet region as well as the corresponding commercial crystals. More importantly, preliminary Glan&#8211;Taylor prism is designed to test its light polarization ability. This work will serve as a guide for future research on innovative short&#8208;wave ultraviolet birefringent crystals.

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrogenation of Quinolines to Form 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrahdyroquinolines Using Water as the Hydrogen Atom Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential process combining hydrogenation and a subsequent stereomutation is presented for trans selective hydrogenation of quinolines using water as the hydrogen atom source. Mechanistic studies reveal that the hydrogenation proceeds through a cascade process comprising an initial cis selective photocatalytic hydrogenation of the heteroarene core of the quinoline followed by a trans selective photoisomerization.








Abstract
The design of a sequential process combining hydrogenation and a subsequent stereomutation is an attractive strategy for the stereoselective reduction of cyclic disubstituted &#960;&#8211;systems to access the thermodynamically more stable trans isomer, which would be the minor compound considering a kinetically controlled cis hydrogenation process. Herein, we demonstrate stereoselective photocatalytic phosphine&#8208;mediated quinoline reductions with water as the hydrogen atom source under mild conditions to afford the corresponding 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with complete selectivity towards reduction of the heteroaromatic part. The method shows broad functional group tolerance and provides access to trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydroquinolines with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. These trans isomers are not readily obtained using established methods, as transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed regioselective quinoline hydrogenations provide the corresponding cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted isomers with high selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the hydrogenation of the 2,3&#8208;disubstituted quinolines proceeds through a cascade process comprising an initial cis selective photocatalytic hydrogenation of the heteroarene core of the quinoline, followed by a trans selective photoisomerization.

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective and Low&#8208;Carbon Scalable Recycling of Waste Polyethylene Terephthalate Through Bio&#8208;Based Guaiacol&#8208;Enhanced Methanolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective and low&#8208;carbon PET recycling strategy is developed using bio&#8208;based guaiacol to promote methanolysis through an intermediate stabilizing mechanism. Under mild conditions (120 &#176;C, 0.6&#160;MPa), the system achieves complete PET conversion within 2 h, producing dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) and ethylene glycol (EG) at yields of 94% and 98%, respectively.








Abstract
The global plastic waste crisis, particularly from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), demands sustainable recycling solutions. PET methanolysis offers a promising route to recover high&#8208;purity dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), but achieving scalable, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally friendly processes under mild conditions remains challenging. This study introduces a bio&#8208;based catalytic system using guaiacol and potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3) under mild conditions (120 &#176;C, 0.6&#160;MPa), achieving 94% DMT and 98% ethylene glycol (EG) yields within 2 h. Unlike conventional acid&#8208;catalyzed or co&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted methanolysis methods, the phenolic hydroxyl group of guaiacol critically stabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate, significantly enhancing catalytic efficiency. The system demonstrates broad versatility across various polyesters and real&#8208;world PET waste streams, including mixed textiles and colored plastics, while enabling selective depolymerization. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) confirm its low carbon footprint, energy efficiency, and industrial viability. This cost&#8208;effective and scalable strategy offers a sustainable solution for PET recycling, addressing both environmental and economic challenges while advancing resource circularity in the plastic industry.

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of Nitrofuran Pharmaceuticals Using Acetyl Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust, automated continuous flow system enables safe, high&#8208;yield nitration of furfural to key nitrofuran intermediates using in situ acetyl nitrate generation. Demonstrated on representative essential World Health Organization (WHO) active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), this innovative open&#8208;source platform ensures rapid synthesis, enhanced safety, and excellent reproducibility, aligning with modern pharmaceutical standards.








Abstract
Nitrofurfural is a key building block for the synthesis of antimicrobial nitrofurans as active pharmaceutical ingredients. Its synthesis involves the nitration of furfural, a substrate derived from biobased resources. However, furfural has a delicate heteroaromatic backbone. Typical nitrations involve harsh reaction conditions, which often compromise this structure, resulting in poor reproducibility and low yields. Although acetyl nitrate, a mild nitrating agent, is suitable for this task, major deterrents remain. First, its conventional preparation method involves conditions that are not compatible with furfural. Second, significant safety concerns are associated with the unstable and explosive nature of acetyl nitrate. These critical issues are addressed herein. A safe and robust continuous flow platform featuring in situ generation of acetyl nitrate for the nitration of furfural to nitrofurfural is reported. The high level of integration and automation enables remote process operation by a single operator. Key furfural&#8208;based pharmaceutical intermediates were synthesized with favorable metrics and high reproducibility. The efficiency of this flow platform is demonstrated using a selection of best&#8208;selling nitrofuran pharmaceuticals (nifuroxazide, nifurtimox, nitrofurantoin, and nitrofural), which were obtained with excellent isolated yields in under five minutes.

         <title>Bismuth Meets Olefins: Ethylene Activation and Reversible Alkene Insertion into Bi&#9472;N Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined cationic bismuth compounds have been exposed to simple &#945;&#8208;olefins, including the benchmark substrate ethylene. Unprecedented and facile insertion, extrusion, and olefin exchange scenarios have been realized. The scope, mechanism, and functional group tolerance of these peerless transformations have been investigated in a combined experimental and theoretical approach.








Abstract
Owing to its fundamental properties as the parent olefin, its outstanding industrial relevance, and the challenges associated with its activation, ethylene remains a benchmark substrate, especially in main group chemistry. Here we report the unprecedented activation of ethylene and related simple &#945;&#8208;olefins by well&#8208;defined cationic bismuth complexes. The polarization of a substrate by a softly Lewis&#8208;acidic central atom and a nucleophilic functional group positioned in a constrained geometry is for the first time exploited in the activation of ethylene and related olefins by compounds of a heavy p&#8208;block element. Mechanistic investigations point toward a coordination&#8208;insertion&#8208;reaction mechanism. The bonding properties of the cationic bismuth species facilitate unprecedented reversible reactivity patterns and unusual characteristics in chemoselectivity.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive AIE Photosensitizers for Enhanced Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops DHTPA, a NIR fluorescent, pH&#8208;responsive AIE photosensitizer that enhances photodynamic therapy for bacterial infections by promoting ROS generation in acidic environments, demonstrating effective antibacterial activity and accelerated wound healing in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Bacterial infections significantly alter the local microenvironment, with acidic byproducts from bacterial metabolism leading to a pronounced pH reduction. Leveraging this characteristic, we synthesized and identified DHTPA, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent and pH&#8208;responsive aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer, for enhanced photodynamic therapy against bacterial infections. DHTPA aggregates exhibit a 2.1&#8208;fold increase in ROS generation under weakly acidic conditions (pH 5.5) compared to neutral conditions (pH 7.4), attributed to its pH&#8208;dependent electronic structure modulation. Upon NIR light irradiation, DHTPA aggregates precisely respond to the acidic microenvironment, significantly boosting ROS production for efficient bacterial eradication. In vitro studies demonstrated that DHTPA achieved over 99.9% bactericidal efficiency against both gram&#8208;negative and gram&#8208;positive bacteria. In a murine infected wound model, DHTPA treatment accelerated wound healing by 2.4 times, markedly reduced bacterial burden, and alleviated inflammatory responses, highlighting its therapeutic potential. By integrating NIR activation, pH responsiveness, and AIE properties, DHTPA presents a precise and efficient antibacterial therapeutic strategy, offering an innovative solution for the clinical management of bacterial infections.

         <title>MOF Catalysts for Plastic Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses MOFs as emerging heterogeneous catalysts for plastic depolymerization. Leveraging their bottom&#8208;up designability, thermal stability, and high porosity, MOF catalysts are suitable for a range of different depolymerization reactions for the wide range of plastics currently available.








Abstract
Depolymerization is a promising solution to address the escalating global plastic waste crisis, as a key enabler for emerging technologies in chemical upcycling and closed&#8208;loop recycling of plastics. By virtue of their unparalleled bottom&#8208;up designability for structural control, stability, reactivity, and compatibility with catalytically&#8208;active metal nanoparticles and enzymes, MOFs have enormous potential as an emerging class of porous heterogeneous catalysts for plastics depolymerization. Herein, we highlight key considerations and advances in MOF catalyst development and design for a range of depolymerization reactions, including alcoholysis, hydrogenolysis, pyrolysis, photocatalytic oxidation, and enzymatic hydrolysis. Other than enabling MOFs to efficiently depolymerize the most abundant plastics in production today, including those with unreacted C&#9472;C backbones (e.g., polyolefins) and polymers with cleavable backbone linkages (e.g., polyesters), their versatility also extends to emerging applications in microplastic capture and degradation from wastewater. These unique properties of MOFs position them as potentially scalable and reusable heterogeneous catalysts that can complement existing inorganic catalysts for practical depolymerization.

         <title>Chiroptical Signal Inversion of Peptido&#8208;Coassemblies in Confined Parallel&#8208;Laminar Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous parallel&#8208;laminar microfluidic strategy enables precise control over the chiroptical signals of peptide&#8208;based co&#8208;assemblies. The confined flow environment manipulates non&#8208;covalent interactions, achieving chiral signal inversion compared to conventional methods. This work presents a novel approach for supramolecular chirality regulation and dynamic chiral material design.








Abstract
Chirality plays a vital role in material properties, and precise control of chiral signals is key to designing functional materials. Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly offers an efficient means to integrate chiral building blocks with chromophores, yet controlling the assembly pathway remains challenging due to the complexity of non&#8208;covalent interactions. Here, we introduce a continuous parallel&#8208;laminar&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly strategy that exploits solvent ordering and solute diffusion in confined environments to regulate chiral signals in multi&#8208;component peptide co&#8208;assemblies. Notably, six nonpolar amino acids exhibit significantly enhanced chiroptical responses, as confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy. Intriguingly, Fmoc&#8208;Ala and 1&#8208;aminopyrene (AP) co&#8208;assemblies formed in a microfluidic chip show a reversed chiroptical signal compared to those from batch reactions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and COMSOL modeling suggest that velocity gradients and shear forces in microfluidics induce ordered non&#8208;covalent interactions, altering excimer stacking and modulating chiroptical properties. This study presents an effective strategy for controlling chiral optical signals in confined environments, offering an interesting approach for supramolecular chiral transfer and regulation.

         <title>Spider Eye Development Editing and Silk Fiber Engineering Using CRISPR&#8208;Cas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiders exhibit unique traits with significant implications for a diversity of fields, and gene editing provides new opportunities for advancing research in these areas. In this study, we developed a CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 protocol for spiders, enabling gene knock&#8208;outs/knock&#8208;ins to study gene function and introduce new phenotypic traits.








Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 gene editing represents an effective and precise technology to induce mutations in the genome, and it has been applied to a wide range of organisms for diverse purposes. However, CRISPR&#8208;based gene editing in spiders has not been reported to date. In this study, we demonstrate CRISPR&#8208;mediated microinjection in parental spiders leading to both knock&#8208;out (KO) and knock&#8208;in (KI) mutations within the spider's offspring. The KO of the gene sine oculis causes total eye loss, confirming the role of the gene in the development of all spider eyes. The KI of a monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP&#8208;KI) within a spider silk gene encoding one compound of the major ampullate silk of the spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum yields red fluorescent silk fibers. This finding demonstrates the feasibility of functionalizing silk proteins in spiders using CRISPR&#8208;based gene editing without influencing silk assembly. Our study expands the application of CRISPR to spiders and provides insights in the fields of developmental genetics as well as material sciences.

Abstract
A magical heterostructures of M&#8208;PBAs (M&#160;=&#160;Co, Cu, and Zn) encapsulated by V&#8208;PBA have been successfully obtained by a facile one&#8208;pot coprecipitation method based on the difference in the binding energies of between these metal ions and ligands, and the nucleation rates of different M&#8208;PBAs. Hence, due to the multiple redox pairs, open frameworks, ordered channels, and synergistic effect of two components, the obtained VM&#8208;PBAs have been tested as cathodes in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). To further inhibiting the hydrolysis of vanadium ions and the collapse of PBAs structures, a series of glycerol&#8211;water hybrid electrolyte with different content of glycerol were designed. Benefiting from the multiple hydroxyl groups, appropriate viscosity and accurate proportion of glycerol, the as&#8208;assembled AZIBs with VMn&#8208;PBAs cathode can exhibit excellent cycling performance (&#8764;73% capacity retain of stable capacity) after 1000 cycles. This work provides a sight of preparation of PBAs nanomaterials and a strategy of improve the cycling stability and rate capacity of PBAs&#8208;based cathodes in AZIBs.

         <title>In Quest of Chemical Probes for DNA Methylation Reader Proteins: Nucleoside and Dimer Analogues of 5&#8208;Methylcytosine Interact with MBD2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design and convergent synthesis of 5mC, 5mdC and 5mCpG mimics to interact with MBD2 reader protein and disrupt the DNA/MBD2 interaction. NMR studies confirm compound binding at the DNA/MBD2 interface, highlighting the advantage of l&#8208;configuration of 5mdC.








Abstract
DNA methylation modulates gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns characterise a wide range of diseases, from cancer to neurological disorders, and serve as validated therapeutic targets and diagnostic tools. Among the proteins involved in DNA methylation regulation, the human reader methyl&#8208;CpG binding domain 2 protein (MBD2) exhibits a strong preference for methylated DNA and initiates signalling cascades predominantly resulting in gene repression. The full description of this mechanism is still to be elucidated. Here, we developed original chemical compounds to interfere with MBD2 and its interaction with DNA. Through convergent chemical pathways, we modified 5&#8208;methylcytosine at position N4 and synthesised the corresponding deoxynucleosides and CpG dimers. We tested 70 compounds in two screening assays to assess their interaction with MBD2 and their ability to disrupt the MBD2/DNA complex. Remarkably, substituting modified nucleobases into CpG dimers significantly boosted the biological activity. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the configuration (d/l) of the modified nucleosides and identified four dimers (5d, 7e, 15e and 16e) able to disrupt the MBD2/DNA complex, highlighting the advantage of the l&#8208;configuration. Importantly, NMR experiments confirmed their interaction with amino acids of MBD2 involved in methylated DNA binding.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric &#946;&#8208;Selective Hydroamination of Enamides for the Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Diamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internal enamides were found to undergo enantioselective hydroamination catalyzed by a cationic iridium complex. An amide group effectively directs the catalyst to achieve unconventional &#946;&#8208;regioselectivity with up to 99% ee. This coordination assistance strategy creates an efficient pathway for synthesizing valuable enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;diamine derivatives.








Abstract
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective hydroamination of electron&#8208;rich alkenes has been developed. The coordination assistance of the amide group to the metal center effectively overrides the inherent electronic preference of N&#9472;H addition to an enamide, delivering unconventional &#946;&#8208;selectivity. Phthalimide is utilized as a readily removable amination agent. This methodology enables direct access to enantio&#8208;enriched 1,2&#8208;diamines from readily available materials with 100% atom economy, exclusive regioselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee).

         <title>Modeled Single&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Site Pt Catalyst with Well&#8208;Defined Coordination Structure for Hydrosilylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom&#8208;site (SAS) catalyst exhibits superior activity in catalytic reactions, and their isolated active sites are anticipated to serve an ideal platform for mechanistic investigations. However, the coordination environment of SAS catalyst synthesized via pyrolysis is challenging to control, and the active sites are randomly distributed, posing challenges for structure&#8208;activity relationship studies. Therefore, the development of model catalyst featuring well&#8208;defined coordination structures remains highly desirable but challenging. Herein, a Pt1C48H61P2Cl SAS catalyst is synthesized by an in situ reduction&#8208;assembly strategy, serving as a modeled Pt&#8208;SAS catalyst with a precisely defined coordination structure. The structure is confirmed as Pt&#8208;P2C1Cl1 by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Under solvent&#8208;free conditions, this catalyst achieves 98% conversion and &gt;99% selectivity in anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydrosilylation with 1 hour and can exhibit good recyclability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the synthesized Pt&#8208;SAS catalyst exhibits a significantly reduced free energy barrier for the hydrosilylation reaction compared to the traditional Pt (111) surface, which can be attributed to weaker interactions during the oxidative addition step, enabling easier product desorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Control of Eukaryotic Gene Expression by a Modular Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive RNA Toolkit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving remote control of biological processes remains a significant challenge in genetics. Although ultrasound has been employed to remotely regulate biological functions by targeting mechanosensitive ion channels, existing systems are constrained by the limited responsiveness of specific channels to specific ultrasound frequencies and their applicabaility to only a few cell types. Sonogenetics has shown promise for promoter control, thereby regulating gene transcription in eukaryotes. Here, we introduce a new modular toolkit for regulating gene expression using ultrasound&#8208;responsive RNA carriers capable of releasing small molecule modulators in response to a broad spectrum of ultrasound frequencies. The cells contain engineered mRNA structures encoding riboswitches or aptazymes, which respond specifically to these small molecule modulators finally controlling downstream protein expression by biocompatible ultrasound. This toolkit is versatile, functioning across various eukaryotic systems&#8212;from yeast to mammalian cells&#8212;and offers control over gene expression by regulating mRNA translation. We demonstrated that this sonogenetic toolkit robustly modulates gene expression, achieving up to a six&#8208;fold downregulation of protein levels in response to ultrasound stimulation. By expanding the application of sonogenetics across eukaryots, this RNA&#8208;based toolkit might provide a promising platform for remotely controlling protein function in specific tissues through on&#8208;demand ultrasound activation in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Charge Polarized Au Sites for Low&#8208;Temperature Acetylene Hydrochlorination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cationic gold catalyzed acetylene hydrochlorination represents a classical landmark in eliminating global mercury pollution, but their sustainable implementation is hindered by acetylene&#8208;dependence design criteria and high operating temperatures. Herein, a platform of carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atoms Au catalysts (Au/BC and Au/NC) with polarized charge characteristics are developed via engineering Au sites with hosted B, N configurations. The negatively charged Au/BC catalyst unlocks the low&#8208;temperature inactivity (413&#8211;423 K) of the Au/NC catalyst, while exhibiting superior catalytic performance in the 433&#8211;473 K operating temperature range. We confirm that the classical scaling relationships on acetylene can be broken by narrowing the adsorption capacity between acetylene and HCl on Au&#948;&#8315; sites via facilitating the back&#8208;donation of d electrons into the antibonding orbitals of acetylene. Prolonging the durability of Au catalysts is achieved through preceding an additional robust Au&#948;&#8315; &#8594; Au&#948;&#8314; cycle prior to the classic Au&#948;&#8314; &#8594; Au0 route. This work opens a promising avenue for low temperature vinyl chloride production.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluoride Enhances Alcohol Binding within a Trigonal&#8208;Prismatic Metal&#8208;Organic Capsule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we utilize the binding of fluoride to boron atoms to functionalize the interior of a boron&#8208;containing trigonal prismatic capsule that incorporates two triangular and three rectangular ligands, enabling the tuning of its guest binding properties. The methyl groups of the triangular ligands guide the rectangular ligands to adopt a &#8216;landscape&#8217; orientation to avoid steric hindrance. This small structural change gives rise to an enlarged interior cavity volume for guest encapsulation, as compared with a previously&#8208;reported trigonal prismatic capsule, where the same rectangular ligand took a &#8216;portrait&#8217; orientation with a non&#8208;methylated triangular ligand of similar size. The methylated triangular ligand contains a boron core, which can bind fluoride ions that point inward. These bound fluorides serve as hydrogen bond acceptors, which increases the affinity of the capsule for hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating alcohols, which are bound in preference to ketones of similar sizes. Moreover, this boron&#8208;containing trigonal prism selectively binds perrhenate over perchlorate, while fluoride binding modulates the cavity charge, leading to perrhenate ejection. These and similar endo&#8208;functionalized capsules may thus be of use in the fields of molecular recognition and separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis acidity of the SbCl3/o&#8208;chloranil system</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While SbCl3 is typically inert toward oxidation by ortho&#8208;quinones, we use o&#8208;chloranil to show that the outcome of such reactions may be altered by the presence of a donor such as triphenylphosphine oxide, which readily traps the SbCl3(catCl) synthon (catCl = tetrachlorocatecholate) in the form of the corresponding adduct Ph3PO&#8594;SbCl3(catCl). The same reaction in the presence of a chloride salt affords the corresponding antimonate anion [Cl4Sb(catCl)]&#8208;. Computational studies indicate that the putative SbCl3(catCl) synthon has a higher chloride ion affinity than SbCl5, suggesting significant Lewis acidity. This property is further demonstrated by the use of the SbCl3/o&#8208;chloranil system for both THF polymerization and Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type alkylation of benzene using 1&#8208;fluorooctane. Finally, the reaction of E&#8208;stilbene with o&#8208;chloranil in the presence of SbCl3 affords the corresponding benzodioxene, suggesting that SbCl3 may also operate as a redox&#8208;active catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Weakly Solvating Dinitrile Electrolytes for Long&#8208;Lasting Room&#8208;Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) relies on advanced solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) offer advantages such as cost&#8208;effectiveness, mechanical flexibility, and light weight; however, their practical use is hindered by limited ionic conductivity, narrow electrochemical stability window, and suboptimal cycling performance. Herein, we present a class of weakly&#8208;solvating dinitrile&#8208;based SPEs (DBSPEs) composed of a poly(2&#8208;(2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl acrylate) network coupled with structurally modulated dinitrile solvents. Through rationale molecular engineering, the synergistic combination of short ethylene oxide side chains and weakly coordinating dinitrile solvents enables weak hybrid solvation of lithium ions, thereby facilitating rapid ion migration and uniform lithium deposition. The optimized DBSPE&#8208;2 exhibits a high ionic conductivity (~2.2&#215;10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1) and an extremely wide electrochemical window (~5.7 V). Notably, the Li||DBSPE&#8208;2||Li symmetric cell yields stable lithium plating/stripping over 6900 hours at 0.1 mA cm&#8722;2 under ambient conditions (26 &#176;C). When paired with LiFePO4 in a full cell, the LMBs deliver a superior fast&#8208;charging capability, realizing 80.78% capacity retention after 1500 cycles at 2.0 C rate. This work provides fundamental insights into the solvation structure and accordingly realizes long&#8208;lasting LMBs with weak solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulated Second&#8208;sphere Coordination in Amorphous Metal&#8208;organic Framework for Efficient CO2 Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The endeavor toward photocatalytic CO2&#160;fixation is largely hampered by the rigid spatial configurations and inadequate orbital overlap between catalytic site and CO2. Herein, we propose a second&#8208;sphere coordination regulation strategy by atomically tailoring the metal&#8208;metal coordination of secondary building unit (SBU). Amorphous metal&#8208;organic framework (a&#8208;MOF)&#160;is constructed&#160;as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept&#160;to achieve creative control over the second coordination sphere. Such architecture transforms&#160;rigid trinuclear nodes into flexible dinuclear motifs. This shift&#160;can open spatial proximity to access the guest molecules, and optimize s&#8208;&#960;* overlap by enabling orbital reorientation. Both in situ experiments and theoretical calculation verify second&#8208;sphere engineering&#160;endows the Lewis base sites with high electron donating capacity and promotes the electron injection into the &#960;*&#160;anti&#8208;bonding orbitals of the CO2&#160;molecule effectively. Hence, the a&#8208;MOF&#160;displays an approximately double the yield in various photocatalytic CO2&#160;reactions&#160;compared with&#160;its crystalline counterpart. Moreover,&#160;its photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;CO2&#160;battery delivers higher discharging voltage and fourfold increment of discharge capacity at 200 &#956;A cm&#8208;2. The unique ability to tailor the secondary&#160;coordination sphere performs attractive merits governing the small molecule binding affinity, aiming to manipulate the local microenvironment of open metal sites for efficient CO2&#160;fixation.</dc:description>

         <title>Local Atomic Off&#8208;centering Mediated Efficient Self&#8208;trapped Excitonic Emission in Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu(I)&#8208;based low&#8208;dimensional metal halides have received significant recognition attributable to their intriguing optoelectronic properties, which instigate the emergence of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) accompanied by intense broadband emissions. However, fundamental crystal structural origin of such STE is still elusive. Herein, we have synthesized Cu(I)&#8208;based mixed halide, Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 nanoplates (NPs) using room temperature ligand&#8208;assisted reprecipitation method, which showed an intense blue emission with broad line&#8208;width, large Stokes shift, long photoluminescence lifetime, high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of ~75%. Temperature&#8208;dependent PL intensity and line&#8208;width analysis unfolded strong exciton&#8208;phonon coupling in NP sample. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function analysis determines the local Cu off&#8208;centering, which provides the required lattice anharmonicity and softness for intense STE in Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 NPs. The existence of such soft lattice structure associated with low energy phonons was verified by sound velocity, Raman spectroscopy and low&#8208;temperature heat capacity measurements. The fluorescence microscopy and super&#8208;resolution optical imaging were implemented at single&#8208;particle level which exhibited minimal temporal PL intermittency with reasonable photostability under high&#8208;intensity illumination. Accordingly, we hypothesize that the intense broadband emission of NPs STEs accompanied by the local atomic off&#8208;center driven lattice deformation during photo&#8208;excitation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating Surface Oxygen in Ce/Mo&#8208;Doped Ni Oxyhydroxide for Synergistically Enhancing Furfural Oxidation and Hydrogen Evolution at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of biomass&#8208;platform molecule oxidation with water electrolysis is a promising strategy to reduce energy consumption in hydrogen production and obtain high&#8208;value chemical simultaneously, yet the efficiency of organic oxidation requires further improvement. Herein, we developed a highly efficient Ce, Mo co&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;based (oxy)hydroxide catalyst, where Mo with high spin state promotes the adsorption furfural, while Ce activates surface lattice oxygen (OL), lowering the energy barrier for OL&#8208;OH coupling to form OOH, the key intermediate for high current densities. The catalyst achieves an industrial&#8208;grade current density of 1000 mA cm&#8315;&#178; at a remarkably low potential of 1.46 V vs. RHE in furfural oxidation, with exceptional selectivity (99.4%) and Faradaic efficiency (97.7%) for furoic acid. When deployed as anode in an anion&#8208;exchange membrane reactor, the NiMoCe/NF catalyst sustains a current density of 500 and 1000 mA cm&#8315;&#178; at a cell voltage of only 1.85 and 2.15 V, respectively, surpassing most reported continuous flow electrolyzers limited to 200 mA cm&#8315;&#178;. Moreover, the system exhibits outstanding durability after 200 hours of continuous operation. This work provides critical insights into the rational design of catalysts for energy&#8208;efficient biomass valorization coupled with industrial hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Local Proton Concentration and *OOH Intermediate Generation for Efficient Acidic H2O2 Electrosynthesis at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction is a sustainable method for on&#8208;site H2O2 synthesis. The H2O2 in acidic media has wide downstream applications, but acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis suffers from poor efficiency due to high proton concentration and unfavourable *OOH (key intermediate) generation. Herein, acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis was enhanced by regulating local proton availability and *OOH generation via fluorine&#8208;doped on inner and outer walls of carbon nanotubes (F&#8208;CNTs). It was efficient and stable for H2O2 electrosynthesis with Faradaic efficiency of 95.6% and H2O2 yield of 606.6 mg cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 at 1.0 A cm&#8208;2 and 0.05 M H2SO4, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The F&#8208;doping regulated the electronic structure of CNTs with elevated p&#8208;band center, and F&#8208;doping on its inner and outer walls also enhanced nanoconfinement effect and superhydrophobicity, respectively. As a result, a local alkaline microenvironment was created on F&#8208;CNTs surface during acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis. The energy barrier for *OOH generation was significantly reduced and oxygen mass transfer was boosted. Their synergistic effects promoted acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis. This work provides new insights into the mechanism for regulating H2O2 electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered CRISPR/Cas12a for Genomic Editing and Tumor Regression</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photo&#8208;triggered CRISPR/Cas12a machinery for in vitro and in vivo gene editing is introduced. The system consists of a caged, inactive ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl phosphate ester photo&#8208;responsive crRNA, which, upon light&#8208;induced deprotection, yields the active CRISPR/Cas12a gene editing machinery (LAC12aGE). The LAC12aGE system induces specific thymidine&#8208;rich (TTTN) protospacer&#8208;adjacent motif (PAM)&#8208;guided double&#8208;stranded breaks in genomic DNA, which upon non&#8208;homologous end&#8208;joining lead to gene repair. The LAC12aGE machinery is applied for gene editing of an exogenous dual fluorescent reporter gene in living cells, as well as the endogenous gene encoding DNA methyltransferase 1. In addition, the LAC12aGE is applied for in vitro gene editing and disruption of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) gene in HepG2 cells, where knockout of the HGF gene results in inhibited cell proliferation and migration, as well as enhanced apoptosis. Moreover, the in vivo knockout and disruption of the HGF gene in HepG2 tumors by the LAC12aGE machinery is demonstrated. The cyclic temporal development of the LAC12aGE system in tumors shows effective inhibition of tumor growth and enhanced apoptosis/necrosis of tumor tissues compared to control systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective CO Electroreduction to Multicarbon Oxygenates over Atomically Dispersed Cu&#8208;Ag Sites in Alkaline Membrane Electrode Assembly Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) to produce multicarbon (C2+) oxygenates using renewable electricity is a promising carbon utilization pathway. However, the performance of this process suffers from low C2+ oxygenates selectivity and insufficient current density. Here, we employed a Cu&#8208;Ag bimetallic strategy to enhance the selectivity of C2+ oxygenates from CORR in alkaline membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer at ampere&#8208;level current densities. The Cu&#8208;Ag catalysts prepared by magnetron sputtering feature atomically dispersed Cu&#8208;Ag sites on the catalyst surface, which are key to promote the formation of C2+ oxygenates. Increasing Ag content favors C2+ oxygenates formation while inhibiting ethylene production. The optimized Cu2Ag catalyst achieved Faradaic efficiency of 71.4% for C2+ oxygenates at 2.5 A cm&#8208;2. In situ spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations revealed that atomically dispersed Cu&#8208;Ag sites on the catalyst surface promote the dissociation of *COCOH to *CCO, thus favoring C2+ oxygenates formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Silylchromium&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Semihydrogenation ofUndirected Allenes by Sila&#8208;metalation and beta&#8208;Silyl Elimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The semihydrogenation of simple allenes remains an issue because of the difficulty in control of selectivity without coordination assistance of directing groups, wherein over&#8208;hydrogenated alkanes and E/Z&#8208;mixed stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;isomers can be potentially formed. We report here an electron&#8208;rich cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;phosphine&#8208;ligated chromium(III) complex serving as precatalyst in promoting the selective semihydrogenation of undirected allenes by forming active silylchromium species. The semihydrogenation allows the selective addition of H2 to the less substituted and electron&#8208;rich alkyl&#8208;substituted C=C bonds of allenes with enabling the suppression of competitive over&#8208;hydrogenation, proving general to form trisubstituted E&#8208;alkenes in high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. By this CAAC&#8208;phosphine&#8208;Cr&#8208;catalyzed selective semihydrogenation, unsaturated nitro, nitrile, alkenyl and hydrogenation&#8208;sensitive bromide, chloride and fluoride were compatible with various substitution environments. The in&#8208;situ forming silylchromium as active catalyst by reaction of low&#8208;valent chromium complex with chlorosilane was established by studying the catalytic and stoichiometric reactivity of this species in the semihydrogenation. Deuterium labeling experiments, HRMS, XPS, EPR and magnetic susceptibility analysis of the related intermediates and theoretical studies support a pathway involving sila&#8208;metalation of allene and b&#8208;silyl elimination processes with silyl as non&#8208;innocent ligand, leading to the E&#8208;alkene products.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Intramolecular &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Polar Amino Acids Bearing &#946;&#8208;Leaving Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#945;&#8208;arylation of amino acids may be achieved by intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions of amino&#8208;acid derived enolates, but for amino acids bearing &#946;&#8208;leaving groups, such reactions are complicated by competing E1cb elimination of the &#946;&#8208;substituent. In this paper we report an approach to the arylation of the polar amino acids serine, cysteine, diaminopropionic acid, and allothreonine by inducing intramolecular SNAr reactions of heterocycles which the heteroatom substituent is stereoelectronically protected from elimination by incorporating it into the ring system of N&#8208;carbamoyl oxazolidines, thiazolidines or imidazolidines. The sequence comprises the diastereoselective formation for a heterocyclic urea followed by an intramolecular N&#8208;to&#8208;C aryl migration, yielding bicyclic hydantoins that can be further hydrolysed to afford quaternary &#945;&#8208;aryl amino acids. The method is practical and scalable, avoids the use of transition metals or chiral auxiliaries, and provides the opportunity to access a variety of &#945;&#8208;arylated products bearing electronically diverse benzenoid or heterocyclic substituents (35 examples).</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Zinc Stripping and Molecular Engineering for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unstable zinc anode is a key challenge limiting the cycle life of rechargeable zinc ion batteries. And current research primarily focuses on the zinc plating process, with strategies to induce uniform zinc deposition for stable zinc anode. Here, we demonstrate that the zinc stripping process has a more significant impact on the subsequent zinc deposition, which exacerbates the formation of by&#8208;products, dendrites, and &#8220;dead zinc&#8221;. Therefore, we propose using aspartyl&#8208;phenylalanine methyl ester (APM) molecules to regulate the zinc stripping, achieving uniform stripping of the zinc anode by increasing the stripping overpotential across high&#8208;energy barriers. Simultaneously, its localized hydrophobic functional groups effectively inhibit the byproducts triggered by solvated water molecules. The experimental results show that the Zn&#8208;APM symmetric cell exhibits excellent cycling stability, with stable cycling over 6500 h (&gt;9 months) at 1 mA cm&#8208;2 for 1 mAh cm&#8208;2 and 700 h at 70% zinc utilization with 10 &#181;m zinc. In addition, the Zn&#8208;APM||Zn0.58V2O5&#8231;H2O full cell exhibits 80% capacity retention after 500 cycles at a loading of 8.1 mg cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Chloromethylation Modified Pyranonitrile&#8208;Based Conjugated Microporous Polymers for Selective One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron O2 Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production utilizing conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs)&#8208;based photocatalysts represents a crucial green technology for achieving solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. Proper material design is paramount to improving the dispersity and charge transfer of CMPs for enhanced H2O2 production performance. Herein, a post&#8208;modification strategy employing chloromethylation reaction was proposed for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, to enhance H2O2 production. The simple one&#8208;step chloromethylation reaction simultaneously achieved two objectives: one is enhanced hydrophilicity through the hydrolysis of cyanogen groups in the pyranonitrile unit to carboxyl groups, and another one is the improved O2 adsorption and charge transfer by incorporating chloromethyl groups. The two objectives synergistically enhanced the H2O2 production rate of the chloromethylated CMP named DCM&#8208;TPA&#8208;Cl, reaching 5.01 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in air, 6.7&#8208;fold of the unmodified photocatalyst. Moreover, the rate achieved at an O2 atmosphere increased by only 1.8%, highlighting its superior O2 utilization efficiency in air. An exceptional 38.02 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 rate was further achieved in water/benzyl alcohol mixtures, exceeding most reported polymer photocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical results corroborated the predominant role of the one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron O2 reduction pathway in the H2O2 generation.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of Photoluminescence of BODIHY Dye Using Water&#8208;Soluble Coordination Cages with Different Shapes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The confinement of guest molecules within supramolecular hosts can alter their photophysical properties. However, the role of the shapes of the hosts in regulating the guest&#8216;s emission remains unexplored. Herein, we investigate how the shape of the host alters the emission behaviour of BODIHY (G1) dye encapsulated within two iso&#8208;stoichiometric water&#8208;soluble coordination cages: MC1 (Double&#8208;Square Cage) and MC2 (Octahedral Cage). Encapsulation of G1 within MC1 results in a highly emissive solution, whereas similar confinement in MC2 leads to non&#8208;emissive host&#8208;guest solution. A similar trend was observed with different set of iso&#8208;stoichiometric cages MC3 (Double&#8208;Square Cage) and MC4 (Octahedral Cage). Using a combination of femtosecond transient absorption and time&#8208;resolved florescence spectroscopy, we observed that the disparity in fluorescence behaviour of BODIHY is attributed to charge transfer interactions between the guest and ligand panels of cages. The shape of coordination cage dictating the preorganization of the guest within the cavity thereby supressing or promoting this charge transfer interactions. Moreover, we demonstrate a turn&#8208;on emission of BODIHY dye due to its preferential binding to a double&#8208; square cage. These findings provide fundamental insights into host&#8208;mediated modulation of guest&#8217;s photophysics and offers a blueprint for designing supramolecular systems with tuneable emissive behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium/Indium Heterobimetallic Alloy as an Effective Catalyst for Reductive C(sp3)&#8211;O Silylation of Ethers with Chlorosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C(sp3)&#8211;O bonds are ubiquitous in natural and synthetic small molecules as well as polymers. The methodology for functionalizing C(sp3)&#8211;O bonds is of great importance for reforming these molecular structures into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks. Here, we describe the reductive C(sp3)&#8211;O bond silylation of ethers with chlorosilanes and magnesium reductants by cooperative rhodium and indium catalysis. This methodology allows the incorporation of silyl moieties into the C(sp3)&#8211;O bond of various unactivated cyclic and acyclic alkyl ethers using chlorotriorganosilanes. Not only the mixture of rhodium complex with indium reagent but also rhodium nanoparticles supported on indium oxide showed high catalytic activity, indicating a remarkable cooperative effect by the two metals. Notably, in both cases, the generation of rhodium/indium heterobimetallic alloy nanoparticles were revealed by mechanistic studies including XRD, XAS, and TEM imaging. This research advances the development of heterogeneous nanoparticle catalysts as an option to enable organic transformations that have not yet been achieved using homogeneous catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular TADF Materials From Calix[3]acridan and Guest&#8208;Linked Polymers for Rapid and Visual Detection of Trace Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a new strategy for rapid and visual detection of trace benzene vapor was reported by utilizing supramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence (STADF) polymeric materials via luminescence change mechanism. Consequently, a new type of multi&#8208;color STADF polymeric materials GPs@C[3]A were constructed by host&#8208;guest complexation between calix[3]acridan (C[3]A) and different guest&#8208;linked polymers (GPs). Interestingly, by adjusting the added molar proportion of C[3]A, multi&#8208;color TADF property of GPs@C[3]A could also be easily tuned. Notably, when a 20% molar ratio of C[3]A was added, GP1@C[3]A exhibited white luminescence. Especially, by using the high selectivity of C[3]A toward benzene and its differential binding affinities for acceptor guests versus benzene, rapid detection of trace benzene vapor was achieved in few seconds with the naked eyes. The limit of detection concentrations for benzene reached 3.5 mg/L, indicating GPs@C[3]A could be used as an excellent sensor for rapid detection of benzene at trace level. Furthermore, GP1@C[3]A could also be fabricated into a visualized and convenient paper&#8208;based sensor strip for detecting benzene in cyclohexane. This work offers an innovative idea for the application of STADF materials in detection, and also addresses the key challenge of simultaneously improving sensitivity, selectivity and visualization in benzene detection.</dc:description>

         <title>ortho C&#8722;H Alkylation of Aryl Chlorides by a Catellani Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a general and practical palladium/norbornene catalysis system that effectively promotes difunctionalization of less reactive aryl chlorides. The key to success lies in the use of a particular NBE derivative as a powerful mediator that synergistically cooperates with the palladium catalyst and an electron&#8208;rich phosphine ligand. A broad spectrum of electronically diverse aryl chlorides (57 examples) delivered the corresponding ortho&#8208;C&#8211;H alkylation/ipso&#8208;olefination products in moderate to good yields. Notably, this protocol features excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, high concentration, scalability and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex aryl chlorides. Furthermore, by integrating this chemistry with its counterparts involving aryl iodides and bromides, an intriguing triple&#8208;Catellani reaction sequence was developed, rapidly increasing molecular complexity and diversity. Finally, DFT calculations were performed, revealing that non&#8208;covalent C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions between the XPhos ligand and the NBE mediator promote the pivotal NBE insertion step.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Structure Origins of Distinct Hydrogenation Activities Observed for Linear and Bent Bimetallic &#181;&#8208;Nitrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogenation of metal nitrides is of particular interest due to the direct relevance to Haber&#8208;Bosch ammonia synthesis. To date, for all bi&#8208; and multi&#8208;nuclear bridging nitrides reported thus far, only those featuring bent M&#8722;N&#8722;M cores can react with dihydrogen (H2) and related H2&#8208;derived species, while the vast majority of linear M&#8722;N&#8722;M congeners cannot. Herein, we present a detailed electronic&#8208;structure study of prototypical bimetallic bent &#181;&#8208;nitrides [Cp*FeIV(&#956;&#8208;SEt)2(&#956;&#8208;N)FeIVCp*][PF6] (1, Cp* = &#951;5&#8208;C5Me5) and [Cp*CoIII(&#956;&#8208;SAd)(&#956;&#8208;N)CoIIICp*] (3, Ad = adamantyl) and linear &#181;&#8208;nitride [(TPP)FeIV(&#956;&#8208;N)FeIV(TPP)][PF6] (2[PF6], TPP2&#8211; = 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraphenylporphinato), as well as &#181;&#8208;imide [Cp*CoIII(&#956;&#8208;SAd)(&#956;&#8208;NH)CoIIICp*][BPh4] (4), using various spectroscopic techniques, in particular, 15N solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, coupled with density functional theory calculations. An in&#8208;depth analysis of their distinct 15N shielding tensors revealed that bent &#181;&#8208;nitrides invariably possess a high&#8208;lying proton&#8208;accepting molecular orbital (MO) and a low&#8208;lying electron&#8208;accepting MO. These electronic&#8208;structure features are key to bent &#181;&#8208;nitrides effecting hydrogenolysis via either two&#8208;electron oxidation of H2 or H2 heterolysis. However, because of symmetry linear &#181;&#8208;nitrides lack potent proton&#8208;accepting MOs, which rationalizes their disparate hydrogenation activities.</dc:description>

Herein, we present a detailed electronic-structure study of prototypical bimetallic bent &#181;-nitrides [Cp*FeIV(&#956;-SEt)2(&#956;-N)FeIVCp*][PF6] (1, Cp* = &#951;5-C5Me5) and [Cp*CoIII(&#956;-SAd)(&#956;-N)CoIIICp*] (3, Ad = adamantyl) and linear &#181;-nitride [(TPP)FeIV(&#956;-N)FeIV(TPP)][PF6] (2[PF6], TPP2&#8211; = 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphinato), as well as &#181;-imide [Cp*CoIII(&#956;-SAd)(&#956;-NH)CoIIICp*][BPh4] (4), using various spectroscopic techniques, in particular, 15N solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, coupled with density functional theory calculations. An in-depth analysis of their distinct 15N shielding tensors revealed that bent &#181;-nitrides invariably possess a high-lying proton-accepting molecular orbital (MO) and a low-lying electron-accepting MO. These electronic-structure features are key to bent &#181;-nitrides effecting hydrogenolysis via either two-electron oxidation of H2 or H2 heterolysis. However, because of symmetry linear &#181;-nitrides lack potent proton-accepting MOs, which rationalizes their disparate hydrogenation activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Benzylic C&#8211;H Sulfation beyond the&#160;O&#8208;Sulfonation Limitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct C&#8211;H sulfation represents a valuable transformation for the synthesis of organosulfates. However, it has been challenging to achieve owing&#160;to the presence of multiple C&#8211;H bonds with comparable strengths and steric environments. Current methods for producing organosulfates primarily rely on O&#8208;sulfonation, which limits their applicability to hydroxyl&#8208;containing compounds. Herein, we report a practical and cost&#8208;efficient method for the electrochemical sulfation of benzylic C&#8211;H bonds. This reaction avoids the need for strong oxidants, demonstrating broad substrate scope, excellent chemoselectivity and site selectivity. The orthogonal reactivity of this protocol is particularly evident in the transformation of alcohol substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Turing&#8208;Structured Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Fast and Precise Peptide Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Turing structures have emerged as promising features for separation membranes enabling significantly enhanced water permeation due to their ultra&#8208;permeable internal cavities. So far, Turing structures are constrained by the highly cross&#8208;linked and heterogeneous porosities, impeding them from the application of molecular separations requiring loose but regular pore structures. This work reports a covalent organic frameworks (COFs) membrane with nanoscale striped Turing structures for fast and precise molecular separations. Porous and hydrophilic modulation layers based on metal&#8208;polyphenol chemistry are constructed on polymeric substrates, which are capable of enhancing the uptake and controlled release of the activator of amines during synthesis. The appropriately reduced diffusion rate triggers the phenomenon of &#8220;local activation and lateral inhibition&#8221; arising from thermodynamic instability, creating Turing structures with externally striped and internally cavitated architectures. The Turing&#8208;type COF membranes exhibit a water permeance of 45.0 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 bar&#8208;1, which is approximately 13 times greater than the non&#8208;Turing membranes, and an ultrahigh selectivity of up to 638 for two model peptides. This work demonstrates the feasibility that Turing structures with ultra&#8208;permeable internal cavities can be created in COF membranes, and underscores their superiority in molecular separations including but not limited to high&#8208;value pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Programming One&#8208;Dimensional Open&#8208;Channel Superlattices with Edge&#8208;Bonding of Meta&#8208;DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The physicochemical properties of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) porous nanomaterials are fundamentally influenced by their channel topological characteristics, including channel size, shape, arrangement and connectivity. However, synthesis of topologically diversified 1D porous crystals spanning the mesoporous&#8208;to&#8208;macroporous range remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a universal strategy for constructing 1D open&#8208;channel superlattices through edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge assembly (edge&#8208;bonding) of DNA&#8208;sparsely modified meta&#8208;DNA (M&#8208;DNA). By programming the rigidity and length of sparsely distributed DNA bonds on M&#8208;DNA surfaces, we achieved long&#8208;range ordered assembly of triangular M&#8208;DNA 1D single&#8208;channel superlattice (3.7 &#177; 1.2 &#956;m) with a macroporous structure. The generality of this approach was further demonstrated by assembling hexagonal M&#8208;DNA into 1D multi&#8208;channel superlattice (3.6 &#177; 1.0 &#956;m) with a mesoporous structure, thereby reducing the pore size from 140 to 29 nm and the porosity from ~94.2 to ~87.5%. Furthermore, an ultrathin gold layer grown in situ on the triangular M&#8208;DNA superlattice exhibited a ~3.3&#8208;fold enhancement in electrocatalytic activity compared to non&#8208;assembled triangular M&#8208;DNA, attributed to the increased surface area and wider bandgap. This work broadens the design framework for porous crystals assembled via DNA nanotechnology and highlights their potential applications in catalysis, energy conversion, and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Noncovalent Synthesis of Topological Heterostructures Using a Site&#8208;Selective Electrostatic Co&#8208;Assembly Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterostructured nanomaterials composed of heterogeneous zones with dramatically different chemical and/or physical properties have attracted significant attention. However, achieving controllable synthesis of heterostructures integrated with segments of different stiffness and morphologies has been highly challenging, limiting their applications. Herein, a site&#8208;selective electrostatic co&#8208;assembly strategy was developed to rationally fabricate topological heterostructures (THSs) containing rigid and flexible segments with different chemical compositions and morphologies. Cationic organometallic complexes have been employed to prepare one&#8208;dimensional crystalline supramolecular polymers (SPs), followed by electrostatic co&#8208;assembly with oppositely charged block copolymers (BCPs) of poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(acrylic acid). It has been found that the BCPs could interact and co&#8208;assemble with the complexes in SPs in situ at some specific sites bearing positively charged groups to form nanofiber&#8208;like moieties. The co&#8208;assembled nanofibers are connected to the intact parts of SPs, resulting in THSs composed of nanofibers and intact parts of SPs. The position of the defect sites on SPs and the dimension of SPs could be finely regulated by performing thermal annealing and/or sonication treatments, further enriching the architectures of the co&#8208;assembled THSs. This study unveils new topologies that exhibit enhanced higher&#8208;order structural complexity in the realm of supramolecular nanostructures, enabling the exploration of their properties and applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Highly efficient narrowband organic luminophores offer immense potentials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity of electroluminescence (EL). Appropriately controlling their structural relaxation and vibronic couplings between the excited and ground states enables the desired narrowband emissions. Herein, based on a design concept featuring dendritic modifications, we demonstrate the exquisite color tuning of narrowband emissions from deep&#8208;blue to green in non&#8208;boron ubiquitous molecular systems.

Comprehensive photophysical and computational studies revealed that the dendritic modifications do not impair the inherent narrowband emission ability of BICz, while enhancing its thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties. OLEDs incorporating BICz&#8208;1.5G and BICz&#8208;2GII demonstrated high&#8208;efficiency, high&#8208;color&#8208;purity blue and green EL, with maximum external quantum efficiencies as high as 24.0% and 28.5%, respectively, and CIE coordinates of (0.13, 0.10) and (0.21, 0.68).

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Observation of Post&#8208;CO Intermediates to Decode C&#8211;C Coupling Pathways in CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) has emerged as a promising strategy for sustainable energy conversion and carbon utilization. Despite intensive research efforts, the understanding of intermediates and pathways from CO2RR to multicarbon (C2+) chemicals remains incomplete. The challenge is to gain insight into the activation of adsorbed CO and the subsequent pathways. Here, we design a specially tailored Cu nanowire array facing a hydrophobic interface as an electrode to highly enhance Raman signals in the in&#8208;situ environment, allowing sensitive observation of the sequential change of various elusive intermediates during CO2RR, such as CO, CH2, CO coexisting with CH2, CH2CO, and CH3.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) has emerged as a promising strategy for sustainable energy conversion and carbon utilization. Despite intensive research efforts, the understanding of intermediates and pathways from CO2RR to multicarbon (C2+) chemicals remains incomplete. The challenge is to gain insight into the activation of adsorbed CO and the subsequent pathways. Here, we design a specially tailored Cu nanowire array facing a hydrophobic interface as an electrode to highly enhance Raman signals in the in-situ environment, allowing sensitive observation of the sequential change of various elusive intermediates during CO2RR, such as CO, CH2, CO coexisting with CH2, CH2CO, and CH3. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the C&#8211;C coupling during CO2RR originates from an asymmetric coupling between CH2 and CO&#160; to form CH2CO, identified as the rate-determining step in the formation of C2+ products formation.

         <title>Machine Learning Reveals In&#8208;Cavity vs Surface Activity for Selective C&#8211;H Borylation by Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide an expansive and tunable platform for heterogeneous catalysis, yet distinguishing between catalytic reactions occurring within their pores and those on their external surfaces remains a challenge. This study employs interpretable machine learning to elucidate structure&#8208;activity relationships in MOF&#8208;supported nickel (Ni) catalysts for selective sp3 and sp2 C&#8211;H borylation. By analyzing over 470,000 MOF structures, we developed a set of 45 concise and chemically meaningful descriptors that capture key structural variations across MOFs. These descriptors enabled us to identify the critical factors governing sp3 vs. sp2 selectivity, revealing distinct activation mechanisms: sp3 C&#8211;H borylation preferentially occurs within MOF cavities via a radical&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism, whereas sp2 C&#8211;H borylation is associated with surface or defect sites, favoring a concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD) pathway. Guided by these insights, we designed Ni catalysts that achieve up to 97.8% sp3 selectivity and 88.7% sp2 selectivity. This work provides a systematic framework for rational catalyst design and establishes generalizable principles for controlling activity preference in MOF&#8208;supported catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Interface Engineering and Additive&#8208;Induced Crystallinity Tuning for High&#8208;Performance Thermally Conductive Polymer Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To boost up the properties of thermally conductive polymer composites, it is essential to conduct comprehensive research focused on interface engineering between the polymer matrix and fillers. Hexagonal boron nitride (BN) or expanded graphite (EG) are commonly utilized as nanofillers to improve the thermal conductivity of polymer composites. However, the interfacial interactions between the polymer matrix and nanofillers are generally weak, making effective thermal conductivity challenging. To address this issue, we have designed and synthesized an electron&#8208;rich and aromatic tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;based reactive mesogen (TRM), which not only possesses high thermal conductivity but also exhibits excellent interfacial affinity with BN and EG at the molecular level. Systematic experiments including photophysical, thermodynamic, structural, and computational analyses reveal that the thermal conductivity of TRM&#8208;based polymer composites is substantially enhanced due to effective interfacial interactions between TRM and fillers. The TRM composites experimentally show excellent thermal conductivity based on enhanced interfacial phonon transfer, and these results are supported by theoretical interpretations. These findings underscore the critical importance of interface engineering between the polymer matrix and fillers at the molecular level in maximizing the material properties of polymer composites.</dc:description>

         <title>Cytochrome P450 Mediated Cyclohexane Ring Formation in Forazoline Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Forazoline A, produced by the marine actinomycete Actinomadura sp. WMMB&#8208;499, is a unique PK/NRP hybrid macrolactone with promising antifungal in vivo efficacy through a previously unreported mechanism.&#160;While a PKS/NRPS gene cluster was identified as a candidate for forazoline production, the precise biosynthetic pathway and the&#160;functions of the tailoring enzymes remain unclear. In this work, the functions of three cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (FrazP1P2P3) were characterized. Notably, FrazP2 was found to mediate cyclohexane ring formation from an 1,3,6&#8208;triene precursor during forazoline A biosynthesis, as confirmed by genetic and biochemical analysis. To gain structural and mechanistic insight into the activity of FrazP2, the crystal structure of a FrazP2&#8208;substrate complex has been solved at 2.3 &#197; resolution. The molecular dynamics simulations and DFT calculations revealed an unprecedented enzyme&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization reaction by FrazP2. These findings expand our understanding of the catalytic diversity of cytochrome P450s, contributing to the diversification of natural products and enabling the creation of unnatural derivatives with increased antifungal potency.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aldehyde assisted water electrolysis offers an attractive pathway for energy&#8208;saving bipolar hydrogen production with combined faradaic efficiency of 200 % while converting formaldehyde into value&#8208;added formate. Herein we report the design and synthesis of noble metal free Cu6Sn5&#160;alloy as a highly effective electrocatalyst for formaldehyde electro oxidative dehydrogenation, demonstrating a geometric current density of 915&#177;46 mA/cm2&#160;at 0.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming many noble metal electrocatalysts reported previously. The formaldehyde assisted water electrolyser delivers 100 mA/cm2&#160;at a low cell voltage of 0.124 V, and a current density of 486&#177;20 mA/cm2&#160;at a cell voltage of 0.6 V without any iR compensation, and exhibit nearly 200 % faradaic efficiency for bipolar hydrogen production at 100 mA/cm2&#160;in 88&#8208;hour long&#8208;term operation. Density functional theory calculations further confirm the notably lowered barriers for dehydrogenation and Tafel steps on the Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; surface compared to Cu, underscoring its potential as a highly active catalyst.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical encryption based on stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescence (SRL) materials has received enormous interest in the field of information security. Metal&#8211;halide perovskites, as a newly emerging SRL material, have shown great potential for confidential information encryption/decryption (InfoED) applications. However, it is rather challenging to ensure high security and achieve high readout efficiency in perovskite SRL&#8208;based InfoED. Herein, we present a unique InfoED strategy using two&#8208;dimensional hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites via delicate organic&#8208;cation engineering, benefiting from the high contrast and quick response of their photoluminescence behaviors. Indistinguishably encrypted information can be efficiently decrypted through triple&#8208;key implementation (i.e., ultraviolet&#8208;light irradiation, temperature control, and narrow&#8208;bandpass filtering) that operates in multiple switching modes, enabling us to demonstrate extremely high security by adopting dot&#8208;matrix patterning scenarios that are virtually uncrackable. As a proof of principle, a simple 2 &#215; 2 patterning can yield a code dictionary with random variants as high as ~10^{47}, which will take as long as ~10^{22}&#160;years to crack using the hitherto fastest supercomputer El Capitan.

         <title>Equalized dual emissions from copper complexes via multichannel balanced intersystem crossing: towards 100% quantum efficiencies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent materials have important applications in biology, medicine, catalysis, energy, information technology, and so on. However, to suppress quenching and improve efficiencies, how to balance singlet and triplet radiations for efficient dual emission composed of equalized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and phosphorescence remains a formidable challenge. Here we report that based on a rigid skeleton of triphosphine CuI complex, modification with carbazole donors results in high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered charge transfer states, which provide additional channels for accurately optimizing the singlet&#8208;triplet ratios. We achieve equalized dual emissions containing 53% TADF and 47% phosphorescence, ~100% photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;luminescence quantum efficiencies and record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies of ~30% for pure&#8208;yellow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Photophysical and exciton kinetics analyses indicate the incorporation of high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered triplet states into dual&#8208;emissive electroluminescence is based on energy&#8208;level matching with the first triplet states of host matrixes.</dc:description>

Here we report that based on a rigid skeleton of triphosphine CuI complex, modification with carbazole donors results in high-lying ligand-centered charge transfer states, which provide additional channels for accurately optimizing the singlet-triplet ratios. We achieve equalized dual emissions containing 53% TADF and 47% phosphorescence, ~100% photo- and electro-luminescence quantum efficiencies and record-high external quantum efficiencies of ~30% for pure-yellow organic light-emitting diodes. Photophysical and exciton kinetics analyses indicate the incorporation of high-lying ligand-centered triplet states into dual-emissive electroluminescence is based on energy-level matching with the first triplet states of host matrixes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Despite its widely appreciated significance, most research on mental health is published in journals focusing on education, social science, psychology, or psychiatry. This contribution intends to enhance discussion between those disciplines and the STEM field by pointing toward relevant studies, advocating for increased knowledge on mental health, and elaborating on what benefits improved mental health literacy could have for both the individual and the academic system in its entirety.








Abstract
In recent years, an increasing number of articles have outlined the mental health crisis in academia. Despite its widely appreciated significance, most of the related research is published in journals focusing on education, social science, psychology, or psychiatry. Despite stakeholders in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) being disproportionately affected, they are often left in the dark about important findings unless they seek out relevant information themselves. This contribution attempts to spark interdisciplinary discussion between psychology, psychiatry, and STEM by highlighting relevant research, advocating for increased knowledge on mental health, and elaborating on what benefits improved mental health literacy could have for both the individual and the academic system in its entirety.

         <title>Merging Hydrogen&#8208;Atom&#8208;Transfer and the Truce&#8208;Smiles Rearrangement for Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines from Unactivated Allylsulfonamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, photoinduced radical hydroarylation of unactivated N&#8208;allylamine derivatives is reported for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines with simple alkyl chains. DFT studies reveal that ipso attack is more favourable than ortho attack when one of the ortho positions at the aromatic group attached to sulfur was blocked.








Abstract
Arylethylamines are crucial elements in pharmaceutical molecules, making methods for their synthesis highly significant. The Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is a well&#8208;developed strategy to synthesize arylethylamine motifs via aryl migration. However, most examples require amide substrates to activate the alkene to attack by a radical precursor. This strategy both limits the product scope to amide&#8208;containing compounds as well as necessitating the incorporation of specific functional groups arising from the initial radical addition. In this work, we overcome these limitations, delivering a hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer from a cobalt catalyst to unactivated alkenes to yield &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines with simple alkyl chains. DFT studies reveal that increasing the steric hindrance in at least one of the ortho positions on the migrating aromatic group promotes ipso over ortho addition, a selectivity that contrasts with previous methods.

DFT studies reveal that &lt;i&gt;ipso&lt;/i&gt; attack is more favourable than &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; attack when one of the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; positions at the aromatic group attached to sulfur was blocked.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arylethylamines are crucial elements in pharmaceutical molecules, making methods for their synthesis highly significant. The Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is a well-developed strategy to synthesize arylethylamine motifs via aryl migration. However, most examples require amide substrates to activate the alkene to attack by a radical precursor. This strategy both limits the product scope to amide-containing compounds as well as necessitating the incorporation of specific functional groups arising from the initial radical addition. In this work, we overcome these limitations, delivering a hydrogen-atom transfer from a cobalt catalyst to unactivated alkenes to yield &#946;-arylethylamines with simple alkyl chains. DFT studies reveal that increasing the steric hindrance in at least one of the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; positions on the migrating aromatic group promotes &lt;i&gt;ipso&lt;/i&gt; over &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; addition, a selectivity that contrasts with previous methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An iron&#8208;based catalytic system can act as an efficient and selective tandem catalyst for the production of poly(silylether)s, followed by the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lactide, providing direct access to novel thermally stable copolymers. The study emphasizes the potential for chemical recycling, making these materials environmentally friendly and suitable for various applications.








Abstract
A shift from petrochemical feedstocks to renewable resources has the potential to address some of the environmental concerns associated with petrochemical extraction, thereby making the production of plastics a sustainable process. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of selective techniques for the conversion of abundant renewable feedstocks into environmentally friendly polymers. We present a one&#8208;pot iron&#8208;based catalytic system, which is active, efficient, and selective under mild conditions for producing of renewable copolymers. We demonstrate that this system can function as a tandem catalyst for the production of poly(silylether)s (PSEs), followed by the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lactide. This effective approach provides direct access to novel thermally stable copolymers. Furthermore, we detail the quantitative chemical recycling of such copolymers, underscoring their potential as new environmentally friendly materials.

         <title>Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Ethylene&#8211;Acrylate Copolymers Synthesized with Highly Active Neutral Nickel Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh molecular weight ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers are directly synthesized with outstanding catalytic activities using a highly active, neutral, single&#8208;component nickel catalyst, which maintain the essential bulk properties of UHMWPE, reach an impressive tensile strength of 44&#160;MPa, and possess improved surface and dyeing properties.








Abstract
Molecular weight is a crucial parameter in catalytic olefin polymerization to determine the thermomechanical properties of polymers. Elevating the molecular weight of ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymer, a typical polar polyolefin has been a persistent challenge. This study presents the direct synthesis of ultrahigh molecular weight (UHMW) ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers using a highly active, neutral, single&#8208;component phosphine&#8208;phenolate nickel catalyst under mild conditions. The coordination&#8208;insertion copolymerization of ethylene and various acrylates, such as methyl acrylate, n&#8208;butyl acrylate, and t&#8208;butyl acrylate, can yield ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers with UHMWs (Mn) ranging from 1000 to 2700&#160;kDa, with exceptional activities of up to 4.03&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. A relatively large&#8208;scale synthesis (30&#8211;50&#160;g) of UHMW ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers was notably achieved. The properties of these UHMW ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers were comprehensively evaluated, demonstrating that these copolymers retained the bulk properties of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) while exhibiting improved surface and dyeing properties. In particular, the tensile strength of the ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers significantly increased with higher molecular weights, reaching 44&#160;MPa (147&#160;MPa after a predrawing ratio of 3.1), which is comparable to that of UHMWPE.

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Driven Cooperative Photocatalytic Coupling of Biomass Valorization and Hydrogen Peroxide Production Using Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel singlet oxygen&#8208;promote photocatalysis on COF&#8208;N0&#8208;3 couples biomass valorization with H2O2 production, diverging from traditional H2O2 photocatalysis, which relies on photoexcited electrons and holes. Herein, singlet oxygen consumes most electron&#8211;hole pairs, facilitating an Achmatowicz rearrangement with furfuryl alcohol. This yields high&#8208;value pyranones and H2O2, surpassing traditional products by 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude in market value.








Abstract
Traditional H2O2 photocatalysis primarily depends on photoexcited electrons and holes to drive oxygen reduction and water oxidation, respectively. However, singlet oxygen (1O2), often underappreciated, plays a pivotal role in H2O2 production. Meanwhile, photocatalytic biomass conversion has attracted attention, yet studies combining H2O2 synthesis with biomass valorization remain rare and typically yield low&#8208;value products. Herein, a strategy of photocatalytic valorization of furfuryl alcohol (FFA) coupled with the efficient co&#8208;production of H2O2 is reported, enabled by covalent organic frameworks (COFs) induced, 1O2&#8208;participated Achmatowicz rearrangement. This study introduces polyimide&#8208;based COF&#8208;N0&#8208;3 with tailored nitrogen content, representing an unprecedently efficient platform for 1O2 production. Remarkably, reducing the nitrogen content of the COF enhances 1O2 production, significantly boosting the H2O2 generation rate. In FFA, the primary pathway for H2O2 production is Achmatowicz rearrangement, achieving a rate ten times higher than that reliant on oxygen reduction reaction in pure water, reaching 4549 &#181;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185;. Mechanism studies revealed 1O2 selectively engaged FFA, bypassing hole oxidation to trigger the Achmatowicz rearrangement, producing valuable 6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;(2H)&#8208;pyranone with 99% conversion and 92% selectivity. This work establishes a coupling strategy for simultaneous synthesis of H2O2 and biochemicals, offering a transformative approach to sustainable photocatalysis.

         <title>Targeted Degradation of ZBP1 with Covalent PROTACs for Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Treatment of Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a covalent PROTAC (C&#8208;PROTAC) was developed to achieve precise and efficient degradation of ZBP1 by leveraging DNA aptamer targeting and NASA&#8208;mediated covalent binding. This approach suppresses necroptosis and mitigates inflammation, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for infection&#8208;induced inflammation and diseases. The findings highlight the potential of targeted protein degradation in modulating inflammatory responses and advancing treatment options.








Abstract
Z&#8208;DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) has emerged as a critical pathogen&#8208;sensing protein that upon activation, triggers necroptotic signaling cascades, leading to a potent inflammatory response and potentially causing significant tissue damage. However, available drugs specifically developed for the effective inhibition or degradation of ZBP1 is still lacking so far. In this study, we developed a potent covalent recognition&#8208;based PROTAC (C&#8208;PROTAC) molecule for the degradation of ZBP1. It consists of a DNA aptamer as the recognition moiety and an E3 enzyme&#8208;recruiting unit, connected by a linker containing N&#8208;acyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl sulfonamides (NASA) groups. The DNA aptamer specifically binds to ZBP1, while the NASA&#8208;containing linker facilitates the formation of a covalent bond between the PROTAC and the target protein. The E3 ligase&#8208;recruiting unit then directs the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system to degrade the ZBP1&#8208;PROTAC complex. This approach combines the high specificity of DNA aptamers with the efficiency of covalent binding and the degradation&#8208;inducing capabilities of PROTACs, providing a powerful tool for targeted protein degradation. The successful application of this technology to ZBP1 highlights its potential for the selective elimination of disease&#8208;associated proteins and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

It consists of a DNA aptamer as the recognition moiety and an E3 enzyme-recruiting unit, connected by a linker containing &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl sulfonamides (NASA) groups. The DNA aptamer specifically binds to ZBP1, while the NASA-containing linker facilitates the formation of a covalent bond between the PROTAC and the target protein. The E3 ligase-recruiting unit then directs the ubiquitin-proteasome system to degrade the ZBP1-PROTAC complex. This approach combines the high specificity of DNA aptamers with the efficiency of covalent binding and the degradation-inducing capabilities of PROTACs, providing a powerful tool for targeted protein degradation. The successful application of this technology to ZBP1 highlights its potential for the selective elimination of disease-associated proteins and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elucidating Relay Catalysis on Copper Clusters With Satellite Single Atoms for Enhanced Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the relay catalysis for urea electrosynthesis on CuAC&#8208;CuSA@NC, &#8220;CuAC&#8221; sites convert NO3&#8722; to *NOx, and &#8220;CuSA&#8221; sites promote water dissociation, yielding *H for *NOx hydrogenation. The resultant *NH2 then couples with *CO2 activated by &#8220;CuAC&#8221; sites, facilitating an efficient cascade catalysis for urea production. This process highlights the synergy between &#8220;CuAC&#8221; and &#8220;CuSA&#8221; sites in enhancing catalytic performance.








Abstract
Relay catalysis represents significant efficacy in alleviating competition among different reactants during coupling reactions. However, a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism underlying relay catalysis for the urea electrosynthesis remains challenging. Herein, we have developed a catalyst (CuAC&#8208;CuSA@NC) comprising Cu atomic clusters (CuAC) with satellite Cu&#9472;N4 single atoms (CuSA) sites on the nitrogen&#8208;doped porous interconnected carbon skeleton (NC), enabling elucidation of a relay catalysis process for co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722;. The designed CuAC&#8208;CuSA@NC catalyst exhibits an approximately threefold higher urea yield rate compared to that of CuSA@NC at&#160;&#8722;1.3&#160;V versus RHE. Ex&#8208;situ experimental results and in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy analysis reveal a formation sequence between the *NH2 and *NH2CO species on CuAC&#8208;CuSA@NC with increasing reduction potential. The combination of theoretical calculations further elucidates that the relay catalysis pathway involves &#8220;CuAC&#8221; sites facilitating the conversion of *NO3 to *NOx, followed by a hydrogenation process to form *NH2 with *H from water dissociation promoted by &#8220;CuSA&#8221; sites, which subsequently couples with *CO2 to produce urea. This work provides novel insights into the investigation of coupling reactions, but not limit to, urea synthesis.

         <title>Mechanochemically Enabled Formal Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction Between Aryl Ethers and Aryl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving two electrophilic reagents are essential in modern synthetic chemistry. This study investigates a novel nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling between aryl ethers and aryl fluorides. The method is characterized by mild conditions, short reaction times, and the production of a range of aryl coupling compounds with high yields. Mechanistic studies show that nickel is involved in the activation of both C&#9472;O and C&#9472;F bonds.








Abstract
Reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving two electrophilic reagents have become increasingly important in modern synthetic chemistry. Previous studies have investigated electrophilic reagents featuring zero or one inactive bond; however, reactions involving electrophilic reagents with two inactive bonds remain unexplored. This study presents the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction under mechanical conditions, involving aryl ethers and aryl fluorides, both of which contain inactive bonds. The reaction successfully synthesized a series of multifunctional biphenyl compounds, specifically including several sparingly soluble substrates that are challenging to prepare in a solvent system. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that nickel and magnesium play a crucial role in the activation of C&#9472;F bonds. This novel coupling reaction offers a beneficial approach for polymer degradation and the development of luminescent materials.

         <title>Photo&#8208;RAFT Polymerization Under Microwatt Irradiation via Unimolecular Photoinduced Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding a base to PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization significantly enhances the reactivity of acidic CTAs with Zn&#8208;based photocatalysts, enabling polymerization under low light intensity (0.25&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). This approach outperforms traditional PET&#8208;RAFT, which showed no conversion under the same conditions. Both acrylates and methacrylates polymerized efficiently. Mechanistic studies suggest base addition shifts activation from bimolecular to more efficient unimolecular PET&#8208;RAFT.








Abstract
Photoinduced radical addition fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization typically requires high light intensity (&gt;5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), limiting energy efficiency, and scalability. We demonstrate that adding a base to PET&#8208;RAFT systems drastically enhances the reactivity of acidic chain transfer agents (CTAs) with Zn&#8208;based photocatalysts (Zn porphyrin and Zn phthalocyanine). This approach enables complete polymerization under microwatt light intensity (0.25&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), a significant improvement over traditional PET&#8208;RAFT, which showed no conversion under the same conditions. Both acrylates and methacrylates polymerized efficiently with excellent chain&#8208;end fidelity. Reactivity was triggered chemically (via base addition) or electrochemically (via electrolytic reduction). Mechanistic studies reveal that base addition promotes a CTA&#8208;Zn photocatalyst complex, shifting the activation from bimolecular to more efficient unimolecular PET&#8208;RAFT.

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Oxidative Degradation of Polycaprolactone into Adipic Acids over Pt/TiO2 in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot strategy is presented to achieve upcycling of polycaprolactone (PCL) to adipic acid (AA) using Pt/TiO2 as a catalyst in water with [BMIm][NTf2] via hydrolysis of PCL and subsequent oxidation, achieving complete conversion of PCL with an AA yield of 85.60%.








Abstract
Upgrading polyester waste into high value&#8208;added chemicals can achieve carbon recycling, which is of great significance for sustainable development. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot protocol to oxidatively degrade polycaprolactone (PCL) with air into adipic acid (AA) mediated by ionic liquid (IL, e.g., 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [BMIm][NTf2]) in water. In this protocol, IL catalyzes the hydrolysis of PCL into 6&#8208;hydroxyhexanoic acid (6&#8208;HHA) and further mediates the oxidation of 6&#8208;HHA into AA over TiO2&#8208;supported Pt nanocatalysts, reaching the highest AA yield of 85.6% under relatively mild conditions (140&#160;&#176;C, 1.5&#160;MPa). Mechanism investigation indicates that both O2&#8226;&#8211; and &#8226;OH derived from oxygen and water are involved in the oxidation of 6&#8208;HHA to form 6&#8208;oxohexanoic acid via two pathways, which further convert into AA. The IL inhibits the overoxidation of AA, thus leading to a high selectivity toward AA. This protocol provides a green and feasible way to degrade PCL and also to access AA.

         <dc:description>
Nontypical sugars represent a prominent, yet hardly, accessible class of biologically&#8208;active compounds. Here, we disclose a technology toward non&#8208;typical sugars that allows facile, and site&#8208;selective functionalization of native sugars. The protocol is compatible with a variety of unprotected carbohydrates featuring sensitive aglycons and a diverse set of coupling partners, providing a straightforward and scalable route to pharmaceutically relevant carbohydrates.








Abstract
Non&#8208;typical C&#8208;functionalized sugars represent a prominent yet hardly accessible class of biologically&#8208;active compounds. The available synthetic methodologies toward such sugar derivatives suffer either from an extensive use of protecting groups, requiring long and laborious synthetic manipulations, or from limited predictability and noncontrollable site&#8208;selectivity of the employed C&#8208;functionalization reactions. In this work, we disclose an alternative synthetic methodology toward nontypical sugars that allows facile, site&#8208;selective, and stereocontrolled C&#8208;functionalization of sugars through a traceless tethering approach. The described silyl&#8208;based redox&#8208;active tethering group appends directly to the unprotected sugar substrate and mediates the C&#8208;functionalization reaction through a photochemically&#8208;promoted 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism, while transforming into a readily&#8208;removable silyl protecting group. The protocol is compatible with a variety of unprotected carbohydrate substrates featuring sensitive aglycons and a diverse set of coupling partners, providing a straightforward and scalable route to pharmaceutically relevant C&#8208;functionalized carbohydrate conjugates.

         <title>Identifying Key Properties That Drive Redox Mediator Activity in Lactiplantibacillus Plantarum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis and isolation of structurally diverse quinones led to defining key physicochemical properties and biochemical interactions that drive type&#8208;II NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh2)&#8208;dependent extracellular electron transfer activity in Lactiplantibacillus plantarum. Analysis of lead quinones in bioelectrochemical systems revealed that the amine&#8208;containing compounds can produce stable current profiles for up to 5 days.








Abstract
Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is known to utilize exogenous small molecule quinone mediators to perform extracellular electron transfer (EET), allowing it to produce a detectable current in a bioelectrochemical system (BES). Utilization of quinone mediators by L. plantarum requires a type&#8208;II NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh2); however, structural variations in the core of 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone EET mediators have shown to yield significantly different current outputs. Herein, we assembled a library of 40 quinone&#8208;based EET mediators to probe the important physicochemical properties and biochemical interactions responsible for Ndh2&#8208;dependent EET in L. plantarum. The library was designed with inspiration from naturally occurring metabolites, and assembly was focused on structural modifications that diversified polarity, reduction potential, and predicted free energy of binding to Ndh2 (&#916;Gcomp), as these properties are hypothesized to drive EET activity. In general, Ndh2&#8208;dependent EET activity in an iron(III) nanoparticle reduction assay significantly correlates to the mediator's polarity and &#916;Gcomp. Five mediators were analyzed in BESs with L. plantarum, and each generated Ndh2&#8208;dependent current over background signal. Importantly, an amine&#8208;containing mediator yielded incredibly stable current output over the course of the experiment (up to 5 days). These findings improve our understanding of structure&#8208;activity relationships for quinone&#8208;mediated EET and provide stable mediators for bioelectronic sensing applications.

         <title>Homologation of Alkenes Using Acetylene as a C2 Feedstock</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method for the homologation of alkenes that employs acetylene as a C&#8322; feedstock and proceeds via an alkyl borane intermediate has been developed. Commercially available but expensive and unavailable alkenes can be synthesized by this methodology from their C&#8322; shorter homologues, which can be much less expensive. A variety of functional groups and a series of alkene substitution patterns were tolerated, and a chain length increase of up to twelve carbon atoms was achieved by iterative homologation.








Abstract
The preparation of diverse homologs from lead compounds has been a common and important practice in medicinal, mechano, polymeric, and many other branches of chemistry. The homologation of alkenes, though important, remains challenging due to the difficulty of (CH2)n insertion into the main carbon chain of alkenes compared to chains containing other polar functional groups. Here, we report the homologation of both terminal and internal alkenes by using acetylene as a cheap and abundant C2 feedstock. The process involves an in&#8208;situ transformation of alkenes into boranes and then into elongated alkenes, during which direct (CH2)n insertion is avoided. The reaction can be carried out iteratively to achieve up to a 12&#8208;carbon elongation.

         <title>Isoselenourea&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Pyrazolo&#8208;Heterocycle Synthesis Enabled by Self&#8208;Correcting Amide and Ester Acylation</title>

         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective isoselenourea catalyzed route to fused pyrazolo&#8208;pyridone and &#8208;pyranone heterocycles has been developed. Mechanistic and computational studies highlight the significance of an intermediate amide or ester product derived from 1,2&#8208;addition that can be diverted to the desired pathway through isoselenourea acylation.








Abstract
Pyrazole heterocycles are prevalent in a wide range of medicinal and agrochemical compounds, and as such, the development of methods for their enantioselective incorporation into molecular scaffolds is highly desirable. This manuscript describes the effective formation of fused pyrazolo&#8208;pyridones and &#8208;pyranones in high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99:1 er) via an isoselenourea (HyperSe) catalyzed enantioselective [3&#160;+&#160;3]&#8208;Michael addition&#8208;cyclization process using readily available pyrazolylsulfonamides or pyrazolones as pronucleophiles and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated anhydrides as starting materials. Mechanistic analysis indicates an unusual self&#8208;correcting reaction pathway involving preferential [1,2]&#8208;addition of the pronucleophile to initially generate an intermediate amide or ester that can be intercepted by isoselenourea acylation, leading to productive formation of the fused heterocyclic products with high enantiocontrol. The scope and limitations of this process are developed across a range of examples, with insight into the factors leading to the observed enantioselectivity provided by density functional theory (DFT) analysis.

         <title>Cleavable Strand&#8208;Fusing Cross&#8208;Linkers as Additives for Chemically Deconstructable Thermosets with Preserved Thermomechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report cleavable &#8220;strand&#8208;fusing cross&#8208;linkers&#8221; (SFCs) as additives for polydicyclopentadiene (pDCPD) thermosets. During polymerization, SFCs fuse two network strands at four&#8208;way cleavable cross&#8208;links and thereby achieve network dissolution at very low loadings without compromising thermomechanical properties. SFCs perform similarly under oven curing and frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) conditions.








Abstract
Permanently cross&#8208;linked polymer networks&#8212;thermosets&#8212;are often difficult to chemically deconstruct. The installation of cleavable bonds into the strands of thermosets using cleavable comonomers as additives can facilitate thermoset deconstruction without replacement of permanent cross&#8208;links, but such monomers can lead to reduced thermomechanical properties and require high loadings to function effectively, motivating the design of new and optimal cleavable additives. Here, we introduce &#8220;strand&#8208;fusing cross&#8208;linkers&#8221; (SFCs), which fuse two network strands via a four&#8208;way cleavable cross&#8208;link.

&lt;p&gt;We report cleavable &#8220;strand-fusing cross-linkers&#8221; (SFCs) as additives for polydicyclopentadiene (pDCPD) thermosets. During polymerization, SFCs fuse two network strands at four-way cleavable cross-links and thereby achieve network dissolution at very low loadings without compromising thermomechanical properties. SFCs perform similarly under oven curing and frontal ring-opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permanently cross-linked polymer networks&#8212;thermosets&#8212;are often difficult to chemically deconstruct. The installation of cleavable bonds into the strands of thermosets using cleavable comonomers as additives can facilitate thermoset deconstruction without replacement of permanent cross-links, but such monomers can lead to reduced thermomechanical properties and require high loadings to function effectively, motivating the design of new and optimal cleavable additives. Here, we introduce &#8220;strand-fusing cross-linkers&#8221; (SFCs), which fuse two network strands via a four-way cleavable cross-link. SFCs enable deconstruction of model polydicyclopentadiene (pDCPD) thermosets with as little as one-fifth of the molar loading needed to achieve deconstruction using traditional cleavable comonomers. SFCs function under traditional oven curing as well as low-energy frontal ring-opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) conditions and lead to improved thermomechanical properties, for example, glass transition temperatures, compared to prior cleavable comonomer designs. This work motivates the development of increasingly improved cleavable additives to enable thermoset deconstruction without compromising material performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ High Selectivity Contact&#8208;Electroreduction of CO2 to Methanol Using an Imine&#8208;Mediated Metal&#8208;Free Vitrimer Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vitrimer catalyst with C&#9552;N bond enables efficient CO2 reduction via contact&#8208;electrocatalysis, driven by water droplet&#8208;induced charges. Imine groups stabilize CO2 adsorption, enrich electrons, and mediate electron transfer, achieving &gt;90% methanol selectivity. The system demonstrates exceptional stability, recyclability, and sustained catalysis, offering a sustainable pathway for CO2 conversion to methanol.








Abstract
Metal catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) face challenges such as high cost, limited durability, and environmental impact. Although various structurally diverse and functional metal&#8208;free catalysts have been developed, they often suffer from slow kinetics, low selectivity, and nonrecyclability, significantly limiting their practical applications. In this study, we introduce a recyclable nonmetallic polymer material (vitrimer) as a catalyst for a new platform in contact&#8208;electrocatalysis. This approach harnesses the contact charges generated between water droplets and vitrimer to drive CO2RR, achieving methanol selectivity exceeding 90%. The imine groups within the vitrimer play a dual role, facilitating CO2 adsorption and enriching friction&#8208;generated electrons, thereby mediating efficient electron transfer between the imine groups and CO2 to promote CO2RR. After 84&#160;h of CO2RR, the system achieved a methanol production rate of 13 nmol&#183;h&#8722;1, demonstrating the excellent stability of the method. Moreover, the vitrimer retains its high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic activity even after recycling. Mechanistic studies reveal that, compared to traditional metal catalysts, the N&#9472;O bond in the imine, which adsorbs the key intermediate *OCH3, breaks more readily to produce methanol, resulting in enhanced product selectivity and yield. This efficient and environmentally friendly contact&#8208;electroreduction strategy for CO2 offers a promising pathway toward a circular carbon economy by leveraging natural water droplet&#8208;based contact&#8208;electrochemistry.

         <title>LIBX&#8208;A401: A Novel Selective Inhibitor of Acyl&#8208;CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) and Its Binding Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of LIBX&#8208;A401, a potent and selective ACSL4 inhibitor derived from rosiglitazone is reported. HDX&#8208;MS reveals that LIBX&#8208;A401 stabilizes the ACSL4 C&#8208;terminus and alters the fatty acid (FA) gate domain. Consistently, photoaffinity labeling, molecular dynamics, and mutagenesis identify key binding residues within the FA pocket. LIBX&#8208;A401 also exhibits ACSL4&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;ferroptotic properties in cells, supporting its therapeutic potential.








Abstract
Acyl&#8208;coenzyme A synthetase long&#8208;chain family member 4 (ACSL4), a pivotal enzyme in lipid metabolism, has emerged as a therapeutic target for ferroptosis&#8208;related conditions and cancer. However, its reference inhibitor, rosiglitazone, has off&#8208;target activity on peroxisome proliferator&#8208;activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#947;), a key regulator of lipid homeostasis. Here, the discovery of LIBX&#8208;A401, a potent ACSL4 inhibitor derived from rosiglitazone devoid of PPAR&#947; activity, is reported. Its binding to ACSL4 is ATP&#8208;dependent, stabilizing the C&#8208;terminal domain and altering the fatty acid gate region, as shown by Hydrogen&#8208;Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry. Photoaffinity labeling identified A329 within the fatty acid binding site, while molecular dynamics and mutagenesis highlighted Q302 as critical for LIBX&#8208;A401 binding. LIBX&#8208;A401 exhibits anti&#8208;ferroptotic properties in cells, supported by target engagement. These findings establish LIBX&#8208;A401 as a valuable tool to study ACSL4 in ferroptosis and cancer, while its elucidated binding mode paves the way for the rational design of improved inhibitors.

         <title>Artificial Photosynthesis of Formamide via an Oxidant&#8208;Free Photoinduced Radical Coupling Route over Pt&#8208;CdS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formamide synthesis from methanol and ammonia was successfully achieved through an oxidant&#8208;free radical coupling route on Pt&#8208;loaded CdS, with considerable value&#8208;added hydrogen production. A series of in situ characterizations revealed that the efficient C&#9472;N coupling between &#183;CH2OH and &#183;NH2 driven by photoinduced holes achieved the synthesis of formamide and hydrogen without formaldehyde, which makes the artificial photocatalytic route more competitive.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale manufacturing of formamide is always involved with the use of carbon monoxide, hence developing a series of eco&#8208;friendly synthesis routes is of great significance. Alternative feedstock of low&#8208;cost methanol is expected to fulfill this breakthrough due to its green and renewable nature; however, the overoxidation of methanol severely inhibits the efficacious formamide synthesis from methanol and ammonia through the conventional catalytic route. Herein, we report the successful development of a direct radical coupling route for converting methanol and ammonia into high&#8208;selectivity formamide and hydrogen without extra oxidants under ambient conditions. The optimized Pt&#8208;CdS photocatalysts offered an impressive formamide production rate of 1.45&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, as well as an exceptional hole selectivity reaching up to 63.5%. The oxidant&#8208;free radical mechanism of high&#8208;efficiency formamide generation as revealed by in situ characterizations (e.g., in situ electron paramagnetic resonance and in situ transient absorption spectroscopy), stems from the photogenerated holes oxidizing the methanol to hydroxymethyl radical for subsequently direct C&#9472;N coupling with amino radical. This work demonstrates an efficient oxidant&#8208;free photoinduced radical coupling strategy with the promise of an acceptable alternative to current technologies for artificial photosynthesis formamide using clean and abundant solar energy.

We report the synthesis of two novel isomeric derivatives of 5,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;a]indeneo (DHI), incorporating a thieno group to reduce torsional disorder. The anti&#8208;C16DHIT and syn&#8208;C16DHIT isomers differ in conjugation characteristics, with the anti&#8208;isomer showing fully delocalized conjugation, whereas syn isomer exhibiting cross&#8208;conjugation. The polymer based on anti&#8208;C16DHIT exhibits high hole mobility of 2.38 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, surpassing that of pIDTBT in same device structure.








Abstract
Nearly amorphous conjugated polymers, though lacking long&#8208;range order, can exhibit high charge carrier mobility and enhanced flexibility, making them ideal for flexible or stretchable OFET applications. However, research on novel structural blocks for this class of materials remains limited. We report the synthesis of two derivatives of the 5,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;a]indene (DHI) core, where two thieno groups are appended to each end to reduce torsional disorder with adjacent comonomers. The two 1,4&#8208;dihydropentalene containing isomers, anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;Br and syn&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;Br, feature distinct thieno group orientations, leading to differences in their electronic properties. The anti&#8208;isomer shows a fully delocalized conjugation pathway, whereas the syn isomer exhibits cross&#8208;conjugation, limiting delocalization along the polymer backbone. These monomers were copolymerized with benzothiadiazole (BT) to form two conjugated polymers, anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT and syn&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT, both with highly planar backbones, good solubility, and solution processability. Morphological studies reveal that anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT exhibits more ordered stacking and higher crystallinity than syn&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT. Devices based on anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT show significantly better performance, with a hole mobility of 2.38&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, slightly higher than the widely studied pIDTBT under identical conditions.

&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis of two novel isomeric derivatives of 5,10-dihydroindeno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]indeneo (DHI), incorporating a thieno group to reduce torsional disorder. The anti-C16DHIT and syn-C16DHIT isomers differ in conjugation characteristics, with the anti-isomer showing fully delocalized conjugation, whereas syn isomer exhibiting cross-conjugation. The polymer based on anti-C16DHIT exhibits high hole mobility of 2.38 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing that of pIDTBT in same device structure.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly amorphous conjugated polymers, though lacking long-range order, can exhibit high charge carrier mobility and enhanced flexibility, making them ideal for flexible or stretchable OFET applications. However, research on novel structural blocks for this class of materials remains limited. We report the synthesis of two derivatives of the 5,10-dihydroindeno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]indene (DHI) core, where two thieno groups are appended to each end to reduce torsional disorder with adjacent comonomers. The two 1,4-dihydropentalene containing isomers, anti-C16DHIT-Br and syn-C16DHIT-Br, feature distinct thieno group orientations, leading to differences in their electronic properties. The anti-isomer shows a fully delocalized conjugation pathway, whereas the syn isomer exhibits cross-conjugation, limiting delocalization along the polymer backbone. These monomers were copolymerized with benzothiadiazole (BT) to form two conjugated polymers, anti-C16DHIT-BT and syn-C16DHIT-BT, both with highly planar backbones, good solubility, and solution processability. Morphological studies reveal that anti-C16DHIT-BT exhibits more ordered stacking and higher crystallinity than syn-C16DHIT-BT. Devices based on anti-C16DHIT-BT show significantly better performance, with a hole mobility of 2.38&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, slightly higher than the widely studied pIDTBT under identical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selectively Accelerating the Generation of &#946;&#8208;Linked Residue Isoaspartate in Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isoaspartate (isoAsp), a &#946;&#8208;linked residue, widely exists in proteins. A method that allows the site&#8208;selective and rapid generation of isoAsp residues in proteins has been developed. This method leverages the genetic incorporation of a side&#8208;chain&#8208;esterified Asp derivative that undergoes a facile intramolecular reaction to form the key intermediate, aspartyl succinimide (Suc); subsequent hydrolysis of Suc gives rise to the major product isoAsp.








Abstract
Isoaspartate (isoAsp) is a &#946;&#8208;linked residue in proteins spontaneously generated through Asn deamidation or Asp dehydration and significantly affects protein properties. However, the sluggish and site&#8208;nonselective generation of isoAsp residues in proteins severely impedes in&#8208;depth biological investigations as well as the exploitation of its unique &#946;&#8208;linkage features. Herein, we introduce a method that allows site&#8208;selective and rapid generation of isoAsp residues in proteins. This method leverages the genetic incorporation of a side&#8208;chain&#8208;esterified Asp derivative (BnD), which undergoes facile intramolecular arrangement to form the key intermediate, aspartyl succinimide (Suc); subsequent hydrolysis of Suc gives rise to isoAsp as the major product. On native sites of proteins, including Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and calmodulin, we demonstrate that BnD&#8208;mediated isoAsp formation is faster than Asn deamidation generally by three orders of magnitude.

         <title>Polychromatic Electrochemiluminescence Imaging of Single Heteroligand Metal&#8211;Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a series of heteroligand MOFs composting of porphyrin and pyrene ligands as crystalline emitters for polychromatic ECL imaging. Due to rational conjugated spacing of MOF, it exhibits excellent energy transfer efficiency and unique polychromatic ECL imaging characteristics, providing the first instance of single MOF crystals in ECL imaging.








Abstract
Conventional polychromatic electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging is realized with the several separated luminophores at the different potentials. In this study, an emerging polychromatic ECL imaging system was constructed based on single heteroligand metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) crystals as nanoemitters through an intrareticular energy transfer process. The heteroligand MOF crystals, named h&#8208;NJU&#8208;241, were coassembled of meso&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) with 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(p&#8208;benzoic acid)pyrene (TBAPy) ligand using benzoic acid catalyst with coordination ability, leading to the conjugated spacing of 0.624&#160;nm between two ligands. Remarkably, an energy transfer efficiency of 92.2% was achieved when the coordination weight ratio of TCPP acceptor and TBAPy donor was only 1.87&#8240;. Different from monoligand MOFs, the heteroligand h&#8208;NJU&#8208;241 exhibits dual ECL emissions in both blue and red regions at one step applied potential, which is first example of polychromatic ECL imaging for single MOF crystals. Furthermore, by adjusting the reaction conditions, the morphology distribution of porphyrin within the crystal can be dynamically controlled, providing a tailored crystal platform for decoding fundamentals in polychromatic ECL imaging.

         <title>Uniform Ion Flow Effect of Dynamic Electrostatic Shielding Layer for Facilitating Homogeneous Nucleation and Deposition on Aluminum Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study optimizes the Al anode/electrolyte interface by incorporating anionic surfactants (sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate) to achieve stable Al anode. The alkyl chains preferentially adsorb on Al surface, forming dense adsorption layer that mitigates corrosion from the electrolyte. Additionally, &#9472;SO3 and phenyl rings provide electrostatic shielding layer with moderately electronegative that regulates ion migration. The uniform ion flow effect facilitates the uniform nucleation and deposition of Al, suppressing dendritic growth and tip effects, thereby enhancing the cycling stability and lifespan of the rechargeable aluminum battery.








Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) present considerable potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, particularly within power stations. Nonetheless, their operational lifespan and commercialization are hindered by issues like Al anode dendrite formation and electrolyte corrosion. To address the aforementioned issues, a stabilizer has been proposed to enhance the electrolyte/anode interface. Experimental and computational simulation results indicate that the surface tension of the SDBS alkyl chain facilitates its preferential adsorption onto the electrode surface, thereby establishing a protective layer that mitigates the corrosion of the chloroaluminate ionic liquid (ILs). Additionally, the suitable electronegativity of the phenyl&#8208;SO3 group generates an electrostatic shielding effect that not only dynamically regulates ion flow but also equilibrates the nucleation and deposition velocity, ultimately promoting the stable planar Al deposition. Consequently, the SDBS&#8208;modified Al//Al symmetric battery demonstrates stable cycling for 500 and 1000&#160;h under high current density (5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and large area capacity (5&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2), respectively. The Al//flake graphite full battery achieves reversible capacity of 90.01&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, significantly improving capacity retention. This study also further explores the effect of additive functional groups and ions on Al anodes, offering insights for the rational design of RABs electrolytes.

         <title>Spontaneous Anionic Double Capture/Displacement to Trigger Single&#8208;Ion Conducting Interpenetrating Polymer Networks with Desired Ionic Conductivity for Durable Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interpenetrating polymer network interface is constructed to enable a quasi&#8208;single ion conductor for the protection of the Zn anodes through an anionic double capture/displacement mechanism, and thereby inhibiting the corrosion of the Zn anode, preventing the side reaction, elevating the Zn ion transference number and stabilized the plating/striping of zinc ions.








Abstract
The engineering of single&#8208;ion conductors (SICs) is a promising strategy to stabilize the anode/electrolyte interface in zinc&#8208;ion batteries. However, the commonly employed single&#8208;ion conductive solid or quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes often lead to a significant reduction in overall ionic conductivity, thereby impeding ion diffusion kinetics. Here, we propose a compromise strategy that effectively balances ionic conductivity and ion transference number. Specifically, a single&#8208;ion conductive interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) with phase&#8208;functional decoupling is developed solely on the anode side, while a liquid electrolyte is retained on the cathode side. This design facilitates a high ion transference number (0.84) while maintaining the ionic conductivity at an optimal level (12.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1). The single&#8208;ion&#8208;conductive mechanism is unveiled as a spontaneous anionic dual capture/displacement process, which synergizes zincophilic&#8211;hydrophobic functionality to ensure efficient reversible Zn2+ stripping and plating. The modified electrode demonstrates outstanding cycling stability of 1300&#160;h at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The assembled NH4V4O10//IPNs@Zn full cell exhibits an exceptional lifespan, enduring 9000 cycles with a remarkable retention of 80.8% at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This work introduces an effective approach for balancing ionic conductivity and ion transference numbers in SICs, offering a promising pathway for the development of high&#8208;performance SICs.

&lt;p&gt;An interpenetrating polymer network interface is constructed to enable a quasi-single ion conductor for the protection of the Zn anodes through an anionic double capture/displacement mechanism, and thereby inhibiting the corrosion of the Zn anode, preventing the side reaction, elevating the Zn ion transference number and stabilized the plating/striping of zinc ions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineering of single-ion conductors (SICs) is a promising strategy to stabilize the anode/electrolyte interface in zinc-ion batteries. However, the commonly employed single-ion conductive solid or quasi-solid electrolytes often lead to a significant reduction in overall ionic conductivity, thereby impeding ion diffusion kinetics. Here, we propose a compromise strategy that effectively balances ionic conductivity and ion transference number. Specifically, a single-ion conductive interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) with phase-functional decoupling is developed solely on the anode side, while a liquid electrolyte is retained on the cathode side. This design facilitates a high ion transference number (0.84) while maintaining the ionic conductivity at an optimal level (12.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The single-ion-conductive mechanism is unveiled as a spontaneous anionic dual capture/displacement process, which synergizes zincophilic&#8211;hydrophobic functionality to ensure efficient reversible Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; stripping and plating. The modified electrode demonstrates outstanding cycling stability of 1300&#160;h at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The assembled NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;//IPNs@Zn full cell exhibits an exceptional lifespan, enduring 9000 cycles with a remarkable retention of 80.8% at 10&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work introduces an effective approach for balancing ionic conductivity and ion transference numbers in SICs, offering a promising pathway for the development of high-performance SICs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Amino&#8208;Oxygenation Cyclization via Alkene Radical Cation/Bisnucleophile Engagement to Saturated N/O&#8208;Heterocycles</title>

         <dc:description>
Electrochemical amino&#8208;oxygenation of alkene radical cations with bisnucleophiles enabled the formation of saturated N/O&#8208;heterocycles. In situ EC&#8208;MS data offered valuable insights into the radical cation&#8208;initiated difunctionalization, allowing precise control over regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.








Abstract
Regioselective functionalization of alkenes to create nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles remains a significant challenge in organic synthesis. Because of their unique electronic and biological properties, these heterocycles are crucial in pharmaceuticals and materials. Herein, we present an electrochemical amino&#8208;oxygenation of alkenes using alkene radical cations and bisnucleophiles, enabling the synthesis of saturated N/O&#8208;heterocycles in an undivided cell. This method employs readily available amides and alkenes, eliminating the need for additional oxidants or redox catalysts. The in situ generation of alkene radical cations results in high yields with excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. Our approach offers a direct route to six&#8208;, seven&#8208;, and eight&#8208;membered N/O&#8208;heterocycles from simple starting materials, broadening access to complex molecules essential for medicinal chemistry and materials science.

         <title>Rapid, Precise, and Robust Supramolecular Polymerization from Functional Oligomeric&#8208;Charged Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular design of oligomeric&#8208;charged poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) amphiphiles enables their crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly with unprecedented rapid growth kinetics and precise size control. This robust supramolecular polymerization allows access to hierarchical hairy structures with dense, uniform micellar brushes via a &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; approach initiated from the surface of two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets.








Abstract
Nature inspires the design of artificial systems with remarkable rapidity, precision, and functionality, yet achieving these attributes simultaneously remains a challenge. Living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) methods have enabled the formation of low&#8208;dispersity block copolymer nanofibers with crystalline cores, but these processes typically involve moderate or slow growth kinetics to ensure well&#8208;controlled and ordered epitaxial crystallization. Here, we report studies on the living CDSA of oligomeric&#8208;charged poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) amphiphiles, demonstrating an unprecedented combination of rapidity and precision. We show that self&#8208;seeding can produce nanofibers with controllable lengths up to &#8764;700&#160;nm within &#8764;15&#160;min (including 5&#160;min of disassembly and 10&#160;min of re&#8208;growth), while seeded growth can generate nanofibers up to &gt; 2000&#160;nm in length within &#8764;20&#8211;40&#160;min, depending on the unimer&#8208;to&#8208;seed mass ratios. Notably, this robust supramolecular polymerization can be initiated from the surfaces of two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets, resulting in hierarchical hairy structures grafted with dense, uniform micellar brushes.

         <title>Tunable Light&#8208;Activated Platform for Controlled Hydrogen Sulfide Release with Tracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable H2S releasing motif was developed, enabling the encapsulation of payloads featuring diverse functional sites. The delivery of H2S was achieved through a COS mediate pathway characterized by an adjustable releasing profile. Additionally, drugs possessing function sites could be readily integrated into this platform, thereby facilitating the construction of prodrugs.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is increasingly recognized for its critical role in various physiological and pathological processes. The development of synthetic donors with controllable release profiles is essential for elucidating H2S's complex involvement in cellular signaling, which remains a challenge. Herein, we report a diverse collection of photocaged N&#8208;methylation thiocarbamates and thiocarbonates, designed to explore how electronic properties and the leaving efficiency of payloads affect H2S release behaviors. These compounds are engineered to release carbonyl sulfide (COS) following the removal of photoprotective group (PPG). The COS could be rapidly converted into H2S by carbonic anhydrase, and the entire reaction progression was monitored by changes in fluorescence signals. Furthermore, this H2S&#8208;releasing platform is suitable for conjugation with active pharmaceutical ingredients, facilitating the creation of H2S&#8208;releasing hybrid prodrugs. Collectively, this novel class of H2S donor not only provides valuable tool for H2S&#8208;related research but also holds significant potential as therapeutic agent.

         <title>Valence Engineering via Polyoxometalate&#8208;Induced on Vanadium Centers for Efficient Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study synthesized a series of novel nanostructures with polyoxometalates (POMs) inserted into vanadate&#8208;based compounds via a solvothermal method to achieve uniform dispersion of POMs and vanadate&#8208;based compounds. The electronic synergistic effect between the POMs and vanadate&#8208;based compounds effectively reduced the Zn2&#8314; migration barrier and accelerated Zn2&#8314; migration on the cathode, resulting in a high specific capacity. This work provides a new perspective on the synergistic interaction between POMs and metal compounds and offers insights into the design of functionally rich nanomaterials.








Abstract
Layered vanadium&#8208;based compounds have attracted attention as cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) because of their low cost, high theoretical specific capacity, and abundant vanadium valence states. However, the slow migration of Zn2+ ions and their poor cycling stability hinder their practical application in AZIBs. Herein, using a one&#8208;pot solvothermal method, the polyoxometalates (POMs) were inserted into the aluminum vanadate interlayer spacing, and a series of novel 3D nanoflower cathode materials (HAVO&#8208;MMo6&#8208;X) were successfully fabricated. The unique electron&#8208;rich structure of the POMs accelerated the migration of Zn2+ on the cathode to obtain a high specific capacity. Owing to the synergistic pillar effect of POMs and HAVO, the interlayer spacing of HAVO&#8208;FeMo6&#8208;50 increased to approximately 14.33&#160;&#197;. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy was used to analyze the coordination environments of the cathode materials. A combination of in situ and ex situ characterization techniques demonstrated the storage mechanism of Zn2+ during the charge/discharge process. Furthermore, the experimental results and DFT calculations indicated that the introduction of POMs had the dual function of improving conductivity and reducing the Zn2+ migration barrier. Thus, this work provides a new perspective on the synergistic interaction between POMs and metal compounds and offers insights into the design of functionally rich nanomaterials.

An ionic liquid&#8208;driven compacting strategy was proposed to form FSI&#8722;&#8208;rich solvation structures with high&#8208;ionic conductivity and low&#8208;desolvation energy at a low concentration of 0.8 M, which enhanced K&#8208;storage thermodynamics and kinetics by promoting the formation of a robust KF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and accelerated K+ transport kinetics, enabling the PB||CSE||graphite full cell to operate for 1450 cycles at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 88%.








Abstract
The development of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) faces significant challenges due to the lack of suitable electrolytes to achieve satisfactory energy density and long&#8208;term stability. This work reports an innovative compact&#8208;solvation electrolyte (CSE) strategy leveraging ionic liquid&#8208;induced manipulation of solvation structures under low concentration for high&#8208;performance PIBs. The CSE, formulated with a low&#8208;salt concentration of 0.8&#160;M, simultaneously exhibits compact solvation structures with abundant F&#8208;rich anions, high&#8208;ionic conductivity, and low&#8208;desolvation energy. These features lead to enhanced K&#8208;storage thermodynamics and kinetics through the formation of a robust KF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) as well as accelerated K+ transport kinetics. Consequently, the graphite electrode in CSE delivers a high&#8208;reversible capacity of 252&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% after 300 cycles at 50&#160;mA&#160;g. Furthermore, the designed CSE enables the Prussian blue||graphite full cell to operate for over 1450 cycles at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1, maintaining an impressive capacity retention of 88%. This work represents a significant advance in the development of safe and compatible electrolytes for advanced PIBs.

         <title>Unravelling the Oxygen Evolution Mechanism of Lithium&#8208;Rich Antifluorite Prelithiation Agent Based on Anionic Oxidation</title>

         <dc:description>
The illustration of the intricate oxygen evolution mechanism of antifluorite Li5FeO4 (LFO) prelithiation agent, which is originally explained in a variety of novel and unconventional perspectives: lattice mismatch induced by the coexistence of Fe&#8208;O tetrahedral (tet.) and octahedral (oct.) activate the lattice oxygen, a pair of edge&#8208;sharing Li6&#8208;O&#8722; configurations dimerize to superoxide and O2, the nucleophilic reaction between superoxide and electrolyte contributes to cathode electrolyte interface (CEI), the oxidized O species shuttle to the anode side participating in the construction of solid electrolyte interface (SEI).








Abstract
Developing sacrificial cathode prelithiation technology to compensate for irreversible lithium loss is crucial for enhancing the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Antifluorite Li&#8208;rich Li5FeO4 (LFO) is a promising prelithiation agent due to its high theoretical capacity (867 mAh g&#8722;1) and superior decomposition dynamic (&lt;4.0&#160;V vs. Li/Li+). However, the oxygen evolution mechanism in LFO remains unclear, limiting its application as an ideal prelithiation agent. Herein, we systematically track the full lifecycle oxygen footprint in LFO lattice, electrolyte and solid electrolyte interface (SEI). We demonstrate the lattice mismatch induced by the quasi&#8208;disorder rocksalt intermediate phase can activate the lattice oxygen oxidation promoting the dimerization to O2. Specifically, in contrast to the O&#9472;O dimers formed within typical anionic&#8208;redox active cathodes, the oxidation of lattice oxygen in LFO generates O&#8722; stabilized in Li6&#8208;O configuration. Significantly, a pair of edge&#8208;sharing Li6&#8208;O configurations transforms into a superoxo dimer, which further evolves into O2 via a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer process. Moreover, we demonstrate that nucleophilic intermediates threaten the stability of electrolytes and SEI. Leveraging the insights above, we offer comprehensive perspectives for the modification of ideal prelithiation agents.

         <title>Electronegative Strategic Positions in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Unlocking High&#8208;Efficiency Gold Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;based COFs with an electronegative skeleton designed for selective gold recovery. The hexaazatriphenylene centers, imine linkages, and pyridine linkers generate electron&#8208;rich sites at strategic positions&#8212;vertex, linkages, and linkers&#8212;thereby enhancing the structural integrity of the framework. These features enable efficient gold capture, providing high&#8208;adsorption capacity and fast kinetics through electrostatic interactions, making the COFs highly effective for selective gold recovery.








Abstract
Gold (Au) concentrations accumulated from electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) and industrial leachates far surpass those found in natural ores, a highly valuable resource if efficient recovery methods can be developed. Despite advancements in covalent organic frameworks (COFs), achieving adsorbents with high selectivity, large capacity, and rapid adsorption kinetics remain challenging because of limitations in partial pore wall sites. Here, we present hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;based COFs (HATP&#8208;COFs) with an electronegative skeleton, specifically designed for selective Au recovery. The hexaazatriphenylene centers, imine linkages, and pyridine linkers within the COFs introduce electron&#8208;rich sites that extend across strategic positions&#8212;vertex, linkages, and linkers&#8212;thereby enhancing the overall structural integrity. These features facilitate efficient Au capture through electrostatic interactions, achieving an exceptional adsorption capacity exceeding 2366&#160;mg g&#8722;1 with rapid kinetics, making HATP&#8208;COFs one of the most efficient pure COFs reported to date. Moreover, these HATP&#8208;COFs demonstrate remarkable selectivity, stability, and scalability. Theoretical calculations reveal that the electronegative skeleton introduces critical binding sites, promoting strong electrostatic interactions with Au3+ ions and improving adsorption kinetics. This work highlights the potential of charge&#8208;interface engineering in COFs as a transformative strategy for developing next&#8208;generation materials.

         <title>A Promising Deep Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Crystal Activated by the Ordered Structure Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising deep&#8208;ultraviolet&#160;nonlinear optical crystal, Cs2KY(B3O6)2 with ordered design of the largest &#960;&#8208;conjugated B3O6 functional groups, has been successfully synthesized through utilizing the similar topological group substitution strategy. It exhibits excellent performance, i.e., the strongest second&#8208;harmonic generation response among the KBe2BO3F2&#8208;like deep&#8208;ultraviolet borates, the best crystal growth habit along the c axis, short absorption edge, and sufficient birefringence.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (DUV NLO) crystals play a vitally important role in many scientific and technological fields, yet their rational design remains an ongoing challenge. Here, through utilizing the ordered structure design, a new KBe2BO3F2&#8208;like DUV transparent NLO crystal Cs2KY(B3O6)2 has been successfully designed and synthesized, in which we first use the largest &#960;&#8208;conjugated B3O6 functional groups to substitute the BO3 to maximize the second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response and utilize the K/YO6 connecting groups to replace two BeO3F groups to optimize the layer connections. Eventually, Cs2KY(B3O6)2 exhibits not only the largest SHG responses in KBe2BO3F2&#8208;like DUV borates but also the best growth rate along c axis (the strong layer&#8208;habit along c axis has been being the greatest obstacle to prohibit the practical application of KBe2BO3F2 and its derivative). Clearly, the substitution from BO3 triangles to similar topological B3O6 groups and from (BeO3F)2 groups to similar topological K/YO6 octahedra can better modulate the functional properties of materials in the larger scale. That results in the superior comprehensive properties of Cs2KY(B3O6)2 and makes it a promising DUV NLO crystal. Therefore, the ordered structure design provides some new insights for assembling the functional and connecting groups to rationally design materials with high&#8208;performance.

Here, through utilizing the ordered structure design, a new KBe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-like DUV transparent NLO crystal Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;KY(B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been successfully designed and synthesized, in which we first use the largest &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-conjugated B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; functional groups to substitute the BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to maximize the second-harmonic generation (SHG) response and utilize the K/YO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; connecting groups to replace two BeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F groups to optimize the layer connections. Eventually, Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;KY(B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits not only the largest SHG responses in KBe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-like DUV borates but also the best growth rate along &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; axis (the strong layer-habit along &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; axis has been being the greatest obstacle to prohibit the practical application of KBe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and its derivative). Clearly, the substitution from BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; triangles to similar topological B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; groups and from (BeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups to similar topological K/YO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra can better modulate the functional properties of materials in the larger scale. That results in the superior comprehensive properties of Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;KY(B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and makes it a promising DUV NLO crystal. Therefore, the ordered structure design provides some new insights for assembling the functional and connecting groups to rationally design materials with high-performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustainability&#8208;Inspired Upcycling of Organophosphorus Pollutants into Phosphatic Fertilizer in a Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactor</title>

First report of organophosphorus pollutants selective degradation, via the synergistic effect of peroxymonosulfate and sodium percarbonate, into phosphates that are continually converted into phosphatic fertilizer by struvite precipitation on a continuous&#8208;flow reactor.








Abstract
With the increasing requirement for phosphorus resources and their shortage in nature, cyclic utilization of organophosphorus pollutants into phosphatic fertilizer might offer a sustainable approach to achieve the recycling of phosphorus. Herein, we first report the selective degradation of organophosphorus pollutants, via the synergistic effect of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and sodium percarbonate (SPC), into phosphates (o&#8208;PO43&#8722;), which are continually converted into phosphatic fertilizer by struvite precipitation on the continuous&#8208;flow reactor. Quenching experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results, electrochemical analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggest that the transfer of electrons from SPC to PMS results in the synthesis of catalytically active species (i.e., &#183;OH, &#183;O2&#8722;, 1O2, and CO3&#183;&#8722;) for hydroxyethylidene&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphosphonicacid (HEDP) degradation. For the real glyphosate wastewater, the PMS/SPC system exhibits excellent catalytic activity with 69.20% decrease in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 37.80% decrease in the total organic carbon (TOC) after 90&#160;min. Indeed, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirms that glyphosate is completely degraded in 90&#160;min with the formation of 271.93&#160;&#181;mol/L of o&#8208;PO43&#8722;, which is further converted into phosphatic fertilizer by the precipitation of struvite with 87.20% yield on continuous&#8208;flow reactor. Finally, biotoxicity of glyphosate to zebrafish and wheat seeds are significantly deceased after treatment of PMS/SPC system by zebrafish toxicology assays and germination tests of wheat seeds.

         <title>Repurposing Post&#8208;Consumer Polyethylene to Access Cross&#8208;Linked Polyethylene with Reprocessability, Recyclability, and Tunable Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successfully repurposing mixed post&#8208;consumer PE into crosslinked PE (XLPE) with reprocessability, chemical recyclability, tunable properties, and potential degradability is achieved. The approach involves catalytically converting PE into telechelic oligomers with hydroxyl chain&#8208;end groups. Subsequent cross&#8208;linking the oligomers or their mixture with commercial macrodiols using hybrid cross&#8208;linkers provides XLPE with the modular properties.








Abstract
Polyethylene (PE) is the most widely produced plastic but accumulation and resistance to degradation has significantly contributed to the plastic waste crisis. Upcycling has presented promising solutions to transform PE waste into value&#8208;added products. In this study, mixed post&#8208;consumer PE was successfully repurposed into reprocessable and chemically recyclable cross&#8208;linked polyethylene (XLPE). This process involved converting PE into telechelic oligomers, followed by repolymerization using a hybrid cross&#8208;linking system consisting of a dynamic cross&#8208;linker 2,4,6&#8208;triethoxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TETA) and non&#8208;dynamic cross&#8208;linker tris(6&#8208;isocyanatohexyl)isocyanurate (Tri&#8208;HDI). In the resulting XLPE, TETA facilitated iterative reprocessing with minimal property degradation across cycles, whereas Tri&#8208;HDI helped preserve functional performance throughout service life. Compared to PE, XLPE exhibited enhanced mechanical properties, reduced creep deformation under application&#8208;relevant temperatures, and high temperature structural stability. Notably, copolymerizing PE oligomers with commercial macrodiols was employed to create composite XLPEs, enabling tuning material properties. After use, XLPE can be efficiently and selectively depolymerized under mild conditions, even when mixed with commercial insulator cables. This depolymerization allows for the recovery of the constituent building blocks, enabling purification and subsequent repolymerization for reuse. This approach demonstrates the potential of repurposing plastic waste into sustainable materials and fostering the development of a circular economy.

         <title>Unusual 1,1&#8208;Dicarboxylation Selectivity in the Domino Hydrocarboxylation of Alkynes with Formate and Application in Polyimide Photoresists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced 1,1&#8208;dicarboxylation of alkynes using cesium formate and water was disclosed for the first time. The dicarboxylation reaction undergoes via &#945;&#8208;selective addition of CO2&#8226;&#8722; to an acrylic acid intermediate. A series of malonic acids, propionic acids, succinic acids, and drug intermediates were synthesized by the methods in good yields. It may provide a new working mode for positive&#8208;type photoresists for photolithographic processing.








Abstract
We report for the first time a photoinduced domino 1,1&#8208;dicarboxylation of alkynes for the synthesis of malonic acid derivatives using a cesium formate solution (80% w/w in water), which is different from previous 1,2&#8208;dicarboxylation methods that usually produce succinic acids. Cesium malonate precipitated directly from the diluted reaction mixture and was collected by filtration without further purification. Interestingly, solid cesium formate with additional water led to a mono&#8208;carboxylation product. The solubility of cesium formate and alkaline environment are two key factors contributing to the outcome. A series of malonic acids, propionic acids and drug intermediates were synthesized by the methods in good yields. Mechanism experiments and DFT calculations indicate that the malonic acid is formed through the &#945;&#8208;selective addition of CO2&#8226;&#8722; to a cinnamate intermediate. This method enables direct preparation of water&#8208;soluble carboxylate&#8208;functionalized molecules and polymers from hydrophobic alkyne&#8208;containing precursors, showing potential usability in photolithography for semiconductor manufacturing.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Mechanistic Control of Nonadiabatic Tunnelling in Triplet Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instanton theory is applied to study the reactivity of triplet carbenes at low temperature. We find a competition between a sequential mechanism of intersystem crossing (ISC) followed by hydrogen tunnelling and a new concerted nonadiabatic tunnelling pathway. This explains the differences in the observed reactivity of three chemically similar carbenes.








Abstract
Experiments on three chemically similar triplet carbenes observed the reaction of one at 10 K, another only when heated to 65 K, whereas the third remained stable despite heating. As the products are singlets, it is clear that the reactions involve intersystem crossing in addition to intramolecular hydrogen transfer. Here, instanton theory is used to study various possible reaction mechanisms, including sequential and concerted pathways. The latter describes a new reaction mechanism which involves changing spin state (a nonadiabatic process) while heavy atoms tunnel underneath a barrier (an adiabatic process). In each case, we find that the concerted pathway dominates the rate at low temperatures, but at higher temperatures it switches to a sequential mechanism. The existence of a crossover temperature is the key to explaining the experimental observations and demonstrates that temperature can control the reactivity of triplet carbenes via nonadiabatic&#160;tunnelling.

The latter describes a new reaction mechanism which involves changing spin state (a nonadiabatic process) while heavy atoms tunnel underneath a barrier (an adiabatic process). In each case, we find that the concerted pathway dominates the rate at low temperatures, but at higher temperatures it switches to a sequential mechanism. The existence of a crossover temperature is the key to explaining the experimental observations and demonstrates that temperature can control the reactivity of triplet carbenes via nonadiabatic&#160;tunnelling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Magnetic Field&#8208;Assisted Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries with Enhanced Reaction Kinetics by Spin&#8208;Polarization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetic field&#8208;assisted lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8208;O2) battery was established by the spin&#8208;polarization strategy. The spin&#8208;polarized catalysts are capable of promoting electron transfer and improv ing the carrier separation efficiency, contributing to the accelerated kinetics of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions for Li&#8211;O2 battery. With the magnetic field, the Li&#8211;O2 battery exhibited a low overpotential of 0.40 V, an ultralow overpotential of 0.12 V and a high energy efficiency of 96.3% under illumination. 








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries have attracted significant attention due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density, but are obstructed by the sluggish reaction kinetics at the cathode and high overpotential. Our previous researches have proved that energy fields such as light, force, and heat are effective strategies to improve the reaction kinetics of Li&#8211;O2 batteries. Herein, we proposed a novel magnetic field&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 batteries via a spin polarization strategy. By doping magnetic Mn2+ ions with spin polarization characteristics into CsPbBr3 (Mn&#8211;CsPbBr3) perovskite, a magnetic field&#8208;responsive cathode was designed and prepared. The incorporation of Mn2+ ions drives the charge redistribution and spin polarization of CsPbBr3, which remarkably improve the carrier separation efficiency and the oxygen species adsorption energy. The&#160;Increased spin&#8208;polarization of the magnetic elements by Zeeman effect in an external magnetic field results in the enhanced oxygen reduction and evolution reaction. In the magnetic field, a low overpotential of 0.40&#160;V was obtained for Li&#8211;O2 batteries with Mn&#8211;CsPbBr3 cathodes, demonstrating an ultralow overpotential of 0.12&#160;V and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 96.3% with the further illumination. The introduction of magnetic fields into the Li&#8211;O2 battery system provides a new avenue for improving the reaction kinetics of rechargeable Li&#8211;O2 battery.

         <title>Short&#8208;Path Hydrogen Spillover on CeO2&#8208;Supported PtPd Nanoclusters for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PtPd alloy clusters anchored on CeO2 enable efficient hydrogen spillover via short&#8208;path interfacial transfer, achieving near&#8208;zero Gibbs free energy (0.023 eV) for hydrogen adsorption. This design minimizes the HER energy barrier, yielding an ultralow overpotential of 5.7 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and robust stability in acidic media, offering a novel strategy for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Hydrogen spillover in supported metal electrocatalysts has garnered significant research attention for its potential to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency. However, challenges remain in facilitating hydrogen spillover and reducing the associated energy barriers. Herein, PtPd alloy clusters are anchored to the CeO2 surface, enabling short&#8208;path hydrogen spillover and lowering the reaction energy barrier in acidic environments. During HER, hydrogen is initially adsorbed on the noble metal surface and subsequently migrates to the interface, rather than precipitating directly on the CeO2 surface. This interface exhibits a near&#8208;zero Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (0.023&#160;eV). Consequently, the catalyst demonstrates an exceptionally low overpotential of only 5.7&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic media, along with remarkable long&#8208;term stability. These findings provide valuable insights into designing highly efficient HER electrocatalysts for acidic environments based on hydrogen spillover mechanisms.

         <title>Chemical Process Development in the Pharmaceutical Industry in Europe&#8212;Insights and Perspectives from Industry Scientists</title>

What are the tasks of chemical process development in the pharmaceutical industry? What are trends and challenges? This Scientific Perspective written by members of the European pharmaceutical industry introduces key concepts of drug development and key drivers for the future of chemical process development.








Abstract
Chemical process development is a critical component in the development process for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). With interfaces to drug discovery and API manufacturing, chemical process development activities must deliver scalable, safe, cost&#8208;efficient, sustainable, and reliable processes for novel as well as marketed APIs. Despite its importance for the pharmaceutical industry and society, the domain of chemical process development, together with its advances and challenges, is often not well known to nonpractitioners. As industry scientists, we provide a scientific perspective on the state of affairs in chemical process development, which we believe will be of value to a broader audience, including academic researchers, students, and professionals from related fields.

         <dc:description>
This article showcases recent breakthroughs by Scheidt and co&#8208;workers in the photoexcited structural reconstruction of carboxylic acids. By leveraging hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer and cyclization sequences, the generated diradicals facilitate the synthesis of valuable &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl and amino phosphonates in a highly efficient and sustainable manner.








Abstract
Photoexcitation of carboxylic acids is challenging due to high energy requirements and low quantum efficiency. Recently, Scheidt and co&#8208;workers reported a single&#8208;flask transformation of carboxylic acids into acyl phosphonates, which facilitates the generation of diradicals under visible light irradiation. Building on this work, an efficient strategy for the structural reconstruction of carboxylic acids has been developed.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights Into H2O Dissociation in Overall Photo&#8208;/Electro&#8208;Catalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The slow dissociation of H&#8322;O, which serves as the rate&#8208;determining step, governs the overall performance of CO&#8322; reduction. Three key regulatory mechanisms are identified as: 1) The proton&#8208;feeding effect; 2) the positive charge depletion effect; and 3) the significant reverse reaction effect. These principles universally influence catalytic systems that involve H&#8322;O activation, providing a framework for atomic&#8208;scale design strategies for energy conversion interfaces in photo/electrocatalytic systems.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction with H2O to produce fuels and chemicals offers a dual solution to address both environmental and energy challenges. For a long time, catalyst design in this reaction system has primarily focused on optimizing reduction sites to improve the efficiency or guide the reaction pathway of the CO2 reduction half&#8208;reaction. However, less attention has been paid to designing activation sites for H2O to modulate the H2O dissociation half&#8208;reaction. Impressively, the rate&#8208;determining step in overall CO2 reduction is the latter, and it influences the evolution direction and formation energy of carbon&#8208;containing intermediates through the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. Herein, we summarize the mechanism of the H2O dissociation half&#8208;reaction in modulating CO2 reduction performance based on cutting&#8208;edge research. These analyses aim to uncover the potential regulatory mechanisms by which H2O activation influences CO2 reduction pathways and conversion efficiency, and to establish a mechanism&#8208;structure&#8208;performance relationship that can guide the design and development of high&#8208;efficiency catalytic materials. A summary of advanced characterization techniques for investigating the dissociation mechanism of H2O is presented. We also discuss the challenges and offer perspectives on the future design of activation sites to improve the performance of photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Isotope Techniques in Chemical Wastewater Treatment: Opportunities and Uncertainties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we would first introduce basic knowledge about isotopic compounds and then scrutinize the physical and chemical influence induced by isotope changes. Special attention will be paid to the uncertainties in explaining the isotope results. Next, the implications in kinetic isotope effects (KIE, including solvent and nonsolvent KIE) and element tracing will be individually discussed. Notably, the combination of isotope techniques with EPR, infrared, Raman, and DFT calculation will be summarized. Finally, the limitations and outlooks will be proposed.








Abstract
A comprehensive and in&#8208;depth analysis of reaction mechanisms is essential for advancing chemical water treatment technologies. However, due to the limitations of conventional experimental and analytical methods, the types of reactive species and their generation pathways are commonly debatable in many aqueous systems. As highly sensitive diagnostic tools, isotope techniques offer deeper insights with minimal interference from reaction conditions. Nevertheless, precise interpretations of isotope results remain a significant challenge. Herein, we first scrutinized the fundamentals of isotope chemistry and highlighted key changes induced by the isotope substitution. Next, we discussed the application of isotope techniques in kinetic isotope effects, presenting a roadmap for interpreting KIE in sophisticated systems. Furthermore, we summarized the applications of isotope techniques in elemental tracing to pinpoint reaction sites and identify dominant reactive species. Lastly, we propose future research directions, highlighting critical considerations for the rational design and interpretation of isotope experiments in environmental chemistry and related fields.

         <title>Unlocking the ConPeT Mechanism: Correspondence on &#8220;Catalytic Asymmetric Redox&#8208;Neutral [3&#160;+&#160;2] Photocycloadditions of Cyclopropyl Ketones with Vinylazaarenes Enabled by Consecutive Photoinduced Electron Transfer&#8221;</title>

Ultrafast absorption spectroscopy highlights that the excited state of the radical anion of 4DPAPN, a TADF chromophore employed as a photocatalyst, is not directly involved in a ConPeT mechanism. Instead, its high reducing ability stems from the generation of solvated electrons through a two&#8208;photon process in acetonitrile solution.








Abstract
Recently, in a communication to this journal, Qiao, Jang, and coworkers described an asymmetric photoredox reaction promoted by TADF cyanoarene photocatalysts (specifically 4DPAPN (3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(diphenylamino)phthalonitrile)). The authors claimed that the high reduction potential required for the reaction in acetonitrile was achieved by the radical anion of the photocatalyst in its excited state, which initiated the reaction. This mechanism is usually named consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPeT), in which two photons are involved: the first one to excite the photocatalyst and generate the radical anion 4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; and the second photon to promote 4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; to its excited state *4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211;. Employing ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, here we report that, although two photons are indeed involved in this transformation, the excited state *4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; is short&#8208;lived, not emissive, and not quenched by the organic substrate employed in the reaction, opposite to what was claimed by the authors. The photocatalyst in the excited state *4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; can generate a solvated electron that is able to reduce the substrate involved in this chemistry. It is worth noting that a different photochemical mechanism is likely to be operative in CH2Cl2, where solvated electrons are much less stabilized and reduction of the solvent might occur.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Force Spectroscopy Uncovers Root Zone&#8208; and Bacteria&#8208;Specific Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate at the single&#8208;cell level the reversible primary attachment between plant growth&#8208;promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and plant roots. Bacterial affinities are both species&#8208; and region&#8208;specific along the root, with flagella playing a key role in mediating these interactions. The physicochemical properties of the root surface and the bacterial envelope significantly influence how these PGPR attach.








Abstract
Understanding root&#8211;bacteria interactions with plant growth&#8208;promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) is key to developing effective biofertilizers for sustainable agriculture. We performed single&#8208;cell force spectroscopy using the atomic force microscope (AFM) to study the primary attachment of two PGPR, Bacillus velezensis and Pseudomonas defensor, to different regions of Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Force measurements with individual cells uncovered distinct attachment strategies by each strain, involving binding via micrometer&#8208;long polymers from both bacteria and root surfaces. Flagella differentially affected the binding interactions of each PGPR; their removal altered binding characteristics differently for each strain, highlighting the importance of flagella in early root colonization. Using silica beads to mimic the negatively charged bacteria, we demonstrated the influence of electrostatic forces on root&#8211;bacteria interactions. We also examined interactions with abiotic surfaces of varying surface energies, revealing the roles of hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces in initial binding. Our measurements show that differences in the physicochemical properties of bacteria and roots are responsible for variations in primary attachment strategies between PGPR strains and root regions. Parallel fluorescence measurements corroborated our AFM single&#8208;cell analysis. Overall, our results provide a nanoscale view of bacterial attachment to roots, offering key insights into how beneficial bacteria colonize roots, crucial for enhancing biofertilizer effectiveness.

         <title>Rational Screening of Siloxane Molecules as Electrolyte Additives for High&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protocol is proposed for screening potential electrolyte additives from a number of siloxane molecules for high&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Octamethyltrisiloxane (MDM), as a result of this screening, greatly improves the high&#8208;temperature performance due to its preferential binding with anions, high reactivity with H2O/HF, and good interface stabilization.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries hold great promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage but face significant challenges at extreme temperatures. Especially at high temperatures, side reactions and electrode dissolution are exacerbated by repeated cycling. It is, therefore, essential to optimize the electrolyte formulation. Here, a series of siloxane molecules are screened to boost the high&#8208;temperature performance of the anode materials in SIBs. Octamethyltrisiloxane (MDM), as a result of this screening, prefers to interact with anions due to the unique electron&#8208;donating of Si&#8594;CH3. This association then weakens the P&#9472;F bond and facilitates the formation of a NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase. Additionally, MDM inhibits the hydrolysis of PF6&#8722;, reducing the deleterious species in the electrolyte. Therefore, commercial Sn microparticles show a reversible capacity of 752 mAh g&#8722;1 at 60&#160;&#176;C after 750 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1, much better than the case without MDM. This result exceeds the reported data at high temperatures. MDM as an electrolyte additive also improves the high&#8208;temperature performance of Bi and hard carbon. The results provide useful guidance for the rational selection of electrolyte additives for high&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Enantioselective Acylation of Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Enabled by a Cooperative Photoredox and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective acylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#9472;H bond via cooperative photoredox and NHC catalysis was disclosed, affording the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl ketones in high efficiency, with good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99:1 er). Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations support the radical pathway and rationalize the radical coupling via open&#8208;shell singlet transition states to be the enantiodetermining step.








Abstract
Organocatalyzed direct and asymmetric functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#9472;H bond is attractive yet challenging. Herein, we report the enantioselective acylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#9472;H bond via a cooperative photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis, affording the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl ketones in moderate to good yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99:1 er). The rational design of novel NHCs guided by the initial evaluation of available catalysts and their application promotes the asymmetric transformation. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the formation of benzyl radical and ketyl radical intermediates and rationalize the coupling of these radical species via open&#8208;shell singlet transition states to be the enantiodetermining step. This redox neutral protocol features mild conditions and is free of transition&#8208;metals (TMs) and pre&#8208;functionalized radical precursors.

         <title>Full Recovery of Epoxy Resin Wastes into Bisphenol A and Epoxy Monomers via Lewis Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and efficient recycling strategy is developed, where a commercially available boron catalyst is used to selectively break C(sp3)&#9472;O bond in epoxy resins to recover bisphenol A, and the other part of epoxy resin is recovered as epoxy monomers by the reconstruction of C(sp3)&#9472;N bond and hydroxyl cyclization, realizing the high&#8208;value and full recovery of epoxy resins.








Abstract
Epoxy resins (EPs) are important thermosetting plastics and difficult to recycle because of their stable cross&#8208;linked structure. In this study, we report a full recovery strategy for the conversion of EPs into high&#8208;value platform compounds, i.e., bisphenol A (BPA) and epoxy monomers such as 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenebis (N,N&#8242;&#8208;diglycidylaniline) (AG80), which involves the selective breaking of the C(sp3)&#9472;O bond using commercially available boron trichloride (BCl3), the reconstruction of the broken C(sp3)&#9472;N bond and the cyclization of the hydroxy groups. The yield of BPA is 93 wt% with a purity of 99%, and the yield of AG80 is 96 wt% with an epoxy value of 0.43. 100% recovery of EP elements was achieved theoretically, and the actual mass recovery of the EPs is as high as 91%. Because of its versatility, simplicity of operation, mild reaction conditions, and recyclability of all solvents and by&#8208;products, this approach shows the potential in solving the current recycling challenges associated with EP waste.

         <title>Developing the Tandem Structure to Regulate Interfacial Chemistry and Promote Ion Transport Kinetics Toward High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem separator (CYANO&#8208;COF|PP|SnF2) is designed to construct &#9472;CN&#9472;TM complexation and lithiophilic/electron&#8208;blocking interlayer for high voltage lithium metal batteries. The stable &#9472;CN&#8208;enriched CEI weakens the catalytic reaction of TM ions into the electrolyte. A hybrid SEI composed of Li&#8211;Sn alloy and LiF achieves dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition.

The chemical properties of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) are crucial for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries, especially under extreme operating conditions. Herein, we propose a delicately designed tandem separator (CYANO&#8208;COF|PP|SnF2) to regulate the chemical stability&#160;of dual interfaces. The cyano group in CYANO&#8208;COF induces a stable CN&#8208;enriched CEI on the surface of high&#8208;nickel LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode through the adsorption/coordination effect with transition metals (TMs), inhibiting irreversible phase transitions, TMs dissolution, and other side reactions. Meanwhile, a straightforward in&#8208;situ conversion is used to construct an artificial hybrid SEI layer comprising LiF and Li&#8211;Sn alloy. As demonstrated theoretically and experimentally, the hybrid SEI with enhanced electron&#8208;blocking ability and rapid transmission characteristics can decrease the electron from the Li anode into the SEI and allow Li+ to rapidly diffuse through the SEI layer, achieving even dendrite&#8208;free lithium plating at the SEI/Li interface. With the synergistic effect of dual interfaces, the NCM811||Li battery maintains a capacity retention of 81.8% within 200 cycles at 4.5&#160;V and 55&#160;&#176;C. This work emphasizes the significance of regulating the chemical properties of double interfaces and provides new insights into the rational design for tandem separators.

&lt;p&gt;A tandem separator (CYANO-COF|PP|SnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is designed to construct &#9472;CN&#9472;TM complexation and lithiophilic/electron-blocking interlayer for high voltage lithium metal batteries. The stable &#9472;CN-enriched CEI weakens the catalytic reaction of TM ions into the electrolyte. A hybrid SEI composed of Li&#8211;Sn alloy and LiF achieves dendrite-free lithium deposition. With the synergistic effect of dual interfaces, the battery shows excellent cycle performance.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Sensitized Activated Formation of Lophyl Radicals by Heptamethine Cyanines Enables Dry Film Photoresists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;intensity NIR radiation around 800&#160;nm enables the manufacture of dry film resists (DFRs) using a combination of hexa&#8208;arylbisimidazole (HABI) and N&#8208;phenyl imino acetic acid. The mechanism is based on activated electron transfer processes supported by the respective product analysis.








Abstract
The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) sensitized generation of lophyl radicals (L&#183;) by heptamethine cyanine led to initiation of radical photopolymerization of multifunctional acrylates when different hexa&#8208;arylbisimidazoles (HABIs) and N&#8208;phenylglycine (NPG) operated as coinitiator. The latter functioned as donor. For a deeper understanding, heptamethine cyanines were used following a photoinduced electron transfer (PET). HABI derivatives with electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing substituents demonstrated that those with electron acceptors resulted in a higher photopolymerization efficiency of multifunctional acrylates. Tri&#8208;(propylene glycol) diacrylate (TPGDA) and tri&#8208;methylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) served as the monomers. Sensitizers (Sens) exposed with a high intense NIR&#8208;light source at 808 nm exhibiting a positive charge in the cyanine pattern significantly operate more efficiently for radical photopolymerization than a Sens without a positive charge. Differences in efficiency of PET can give an explanation for these differences. The heat generated by the cyanine's internal conversion from S1 to S0 additionally influenced the endothermic reaction between L&#183; and NPG. These systems worked in practical applications for dry film photoresists (DFRs), reported here for the first time.

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) monolayer is electrodeposited on Fe foil and effectively functioned as a binder for a secondary layer of a cross&#8208;linked polymer network, which is photo&#8208;polymerized on the NHC monolayer. The dual coating, constructed of NHC monolayer and polymer film, as a primary and a secondary coating, respectively, effectively preventes corrosion formation on Fe.








Abstract
The development of highly stable coatings on iron is essential for mitigating corrosion formation. Herein, it is demonstrated that a self&#8208;assembled monolayer of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) can be electrodeposited on iron foil and function as a binder for a secondary, crosslinked polymer network coating. The dual layer coating, constructed of a monolayer of NHCs and a polymer film, as a primary and a secondary coating, respectively, effectively preventes corrosion formation with a protective efficiency of 99.6&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2&#160;%, as determined by polarization measurements in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. Spectroscopic analysis identified the formation of a chemical interaction between the NHC monolayer and the polymer film. The strong anchoring of NHC to iron along with its chemical interaction with the polymer film induced high stability and durability of the dual&#8208;layer coating to effectively protect the coated iron from corrosion formation.

         <title>Artificial Carbon Neutrality Through Aprotic CO2 Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the reducing hydrogen&#8208;mediated natural photosynthesis, in which CO&#8322; is converted into O&#8322; and glucose, a lithium&#8208;mediated aprotic electrochemical strategy for splitting CO&#8322; into O&#8322; and carbon taking advantage of the stronger reducibility of lithium over hydrogen is developed. Within the designed electrochemical device, CO2 is reduced sequentially into Li&#8322;CO&#8323; and Li&#8322;O, followed by the oxidation of Li2O to release O2. Moreover, the high O2 yield of over 98% can be achieved with the assistance of appropriate catalysts, significantly advancing carbon&#8208;neutral technologies.








Abstract
Global climate change mitigation necessitates global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. Natural photosynthesis exemplifies an ingenious approach to carbon neutrality, converting CO2 into O2 and glucose through light and dark reactions. Inspired by the hydrogen&#8208;involved processes in photosynthesis, an aprotic electrochemical strategy for CO2 splitting into O2 and carbon using lithium as a reducing mediator is presented. The designed electrochemical device features a gas cathode with a nanoscale Co catalyst and a metallic lithium anode. When CO2 is introduced to the cathode, it undergoes a two&#8208;step lithium&#8208;related electrochemical reduction, converting it sequentially into Li2CO3 and Li2O. Li2O is then oxidized to produce O2 gas at the expense of renewable electrical energy. This process achieves an impressive O2 yield exceeding 94.7%, significantly outperforming the efficiency of natural photosynthesis. Moreover, the O2 yield can be further increased to 98.6% by employing an optimized RuCo catalyst. This study offers a new practical and controllable pathway to produce O2 from CO2, strongly promoting the sustainable development of human society for realizing carbon neutrality as well as exploring and conquering nature.

         <title>A General and Mild Two&#8208;Step Strategy Using Bioderived Diols and CO2 for Chemically Recyclable Polycarbonates and Closed&#8208;Loop CO2 Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and mild two&#8208;step synthetic strategy was developed to synthesize chemically recyclable polycarbonates for CO2 closed&#8208;loop fixation. This approach involves the synthesis of a series of six&#8208;membered cyclic carbonate monomers from bio&#8208;derived diols and CO2, followed by organocatalytic living/controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization.








Abstract
Developing chemically recyclable polymers using CO2 and sustainable co&#8208;feedstocks is an important strategy for achieving carbon&#8208;neutral production of new polymers and mitigating plastic pollution. Herein, a series of six&#8208;membered cyclic carbonate monomers with different alkyl &#945;&#8208;substituents were synthesized using CO2 and bioderived 1,3&#8208;alkanediol as raw materials at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The organocatalytic ring&#8208;opening polymerization was systematically studied using a range of common and readily available organocatalysts. Phosphazene base (t&#8208;BuP2) was identified as the most effective catalyst, offering excellent control over the entire polymerization. The regioselectivity of the synthesized polycarbonates, ranged from 0.74 to 0.99, with the highest value achieved when the side group was isopropyl (highest steric hindrance).

     alt="A General and Mild Two-Step Strategy Using Bioderived Diols and CO2 for Chemically Recyclable Polycarbonates and Closed-Loop CO2 Fixation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general and mild two-step synthetic strategy was developed to synthesize chemically recyclable polycarbonates for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; closed-loop fixation. This approach involves the synthesis of a series of six-membered cyclic carbonate monomers from bio-derived diols and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, followed by organocatalytic living/controlled ring-opening polymerization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing chemically recyclable polymers using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and sustainable co-feedstocks is an important strategy for achieving carbon-neutral production of new polymers and mitigating plastic pollution. Herein, a series of six-membered cyclic carbonate monomers with different alkyl &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-substituents were synthesized using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and bioderived 1,3-alkanediol as raw materials at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The organocatalytic ring-opening polymerization was systematically studied using a range of common and readily available organocatalysts. Phosphazene base (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-BuP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was identified as the most effective catalyst, offering excellent control over the entire polymerization. The regioselectivity of the synthesized polycarbonates, ranged from 0.74 to 0.99, with the highest value achieved when the side group was isopropyl (highest steric hindrance). Notably, the &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-substituent in the monomers reduced the ring strains, allowing the resulting polycarbonates to be fully recycled to the monomers without decarboxylation. The recycling process effectively traps CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a closed loop between monomers and polymers, preventing its release into the atmosphere. The alkyl side groups enhanced the hydrophobicity of the polycarbonates, thereby reducing the likelihood of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release through hydrolysis during their lifecycle, achieving a robust CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; closed-loop fixation. The utility of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based aliphatic polycarbonates as adhesives and the ability of copolymerization with &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-lactide were explored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoisomerization of Azobenzene&#8208;Extended Charybdotoxin for the Optical Control of Kv1.2 Potassium Channel Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click&#8208;chemistry compatible azobenzenes are synthesized and coupled on various positions at the surface of a disulfide&#8208;bridged natural peptide. Monomers and dimers are produced and linked by azobenzene. The impact of azobenzene photoswitching on the ion channel blocking potency of the peptide is evaluated and revealed that proper positioning leads to successful photomodulation.








Abstract
Natural peptides from animal venoms effectively modulate ion channel activity. While photoswitches regulate small compound pharmacology, their application to natural peptides rich in disulfide bridges and active on ion channels is novel due to larger pharmacophores. A pilot study integrating azobenzene photoswitches into charybdotoxin (ChTx), known for blocking potassium channels is initiated. Two click&#8208;chemistry&#8208;compatible azobenzene are synthesized differing in length and amide orientation (Az1 &amp; Az2). Az1 is grafted onto ChTx at various amino acid positions using L&#8208;azidohomoalanine mutation. ChTx monomers outperformed dimers, particularly with azobenzene at position 14, by exhibiting optimal photoswitching activity. In the cis configuration, Az1 altered ChTx's pharmacophore, reducing potassium channel blockage, while conversely, Az2 increased ChTx potency. This study pioneers photoswitch application to complex peptides, leveraging structure&#8208;activity relationships. Successful integration depends on precise azobenzene positioning and chemical grafting guided by SAR insights. This advancement underscores the adaptability of photoswitch technology to intricate peptide structures, offering new avenues for pharmacological modulation.

         <title>Chlorinated Bithiophene Imide&#8208;Based n&#8208;Type Polymers: Synthesis, Structure&#8211;Property Correlations, and Applications in Organic Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chlorinated imide&#8208;functionalized electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes, ClBTI and ClBTI2, were developed, and the n&#8208;type polymers built from them showed ordered structure, high crystallinity, and sizable electron mobility. Ternary all&#8208;polymer solar cells fabricated using them as the third component delivered power conversion efficiencies up to 19.35%, much higher than that (15.84%) of the binary one.








Abstract
Developing electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)arenes with optimized geometries and electronic properties is imperative for advancing n&#8208;type polymers and organic electronic devices. We report here the design and synthesis of two chlorinated imide&#8208;functionalized electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes, namely chlorine&#8208;substituted bithiophene imide (ClBTI) and its fused dimer (ClBTI2). The corresponding polymers show a near&#8208;planar framework, appropriate frontier molecular orbital levels, and good solubility. When integrated into organic thin&#8208;film transistors, ClBTI2&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer afforded unipolar electron mobility of up to 0.48 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The binary all&#8208;PSCs based on PM6 and new polymers show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 1%. Interestingly, by introducing these polymers with ordered structure, high crystallinity, and sizable electron mobility as the third component into the host system PM6:PY&#8208;IT, continuous interpenetrating networks with large fibrillar structures can be formed. Investigations of charge transfer kinetics and energy loss analyses unveiled that ClBTI2&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer P(ClBTI2&#8208;BTI) enables optimized charge transport, reduced charge recombination, and minimized non&#8208;radiative loss within the all&#8208;polymer ternary blends, yielding a remarkable PCE of 19.35% (certified: 19.20%) through optimizing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PM6:PY&#8208;IT blend. The structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance relationships provide valuable insights into the design of electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)arenes and n&#8208;type polymers, marking a great progress in the development of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers for organic electronic devices.

         <title>Formation and Metallomimetic Reactivity of a Transient Dicoordinate Alkylborylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Generation of the first metal&#8208;free dicoordinate alkylborylene, [(CAAC)BCy] (CAAC&#160;=&#160;cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene, Cy&#160;=&#160;cyclohexyl), is reported. This species exhibits metallomimetic reactivity with donor ligands and dihydrogen and is more reactive than amino counterparts. Metallomimetic chemistry of the carbonyl&#8208;ligated borylene [(CAAC)BCy(CO)] is also demonstrated. 








Abstract
While existing literature has primarily focused on carbene&#8208;stabilized amino&#8208; and arylborylenes of the form [(carbene)BR] (R&#160;=&#160;substituent), herein we report the generation and metallomimetic reactivity of the first carbene&#8208;stabilized alkylborylene [(CAACMe)BCy] (CAACMe&#160;=&#160;1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethylpyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, Cy&#160;=&#160;cyclohexyl). Furthermore, the transition metal&#8208;like decarbonylation reactions of a borylene complex, [(CAACMe)BCy(CO)], derived from borylene [(CAACMe)BCy] and CO, are described. Additional findings described include i) the identification of the coordination stages of the ligand to boron towards forming complexes [(CAACMe)BCyL] in the reduction route from starting material [(CAACMe)BCyBr2] and in the photolysis route from carbonyl complex [(CAACMe)BCy(CO], and ii) insights from quantum&#8208;chemical computations regarding the molecular and electronic structure of the borylene at various stages.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Ammonia Synthesis by Using Zero&#8208;Valent Metal Powder with Alcohols or Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we discovered the first molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation with inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle zero&#8208;valent metal powders and alcohols or water in the presence of a catalytic amount of samarium compounds, where more than 1000 equiv of ammonia were formed based on the molybdenum atom of the catalyst. 








Abstract
We have recently achieved a highly effective ammonia formation from dinitrogen using samarium diiodide and water under ambient reaction conditions. However, further research is needed to establish a carbon&#8208;free green ammonia production route without carbon dioxide emissions. In this study, we have developed a novel molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation method using a combination of zero&#8208;valent metal powders as reductants and alcohols or H2O as a proton source under ambient reaction conditions. In this reaction system, samarium compounds serve as crucial electron mediators for the molybdenum complexes. Remarkably, the combination of zinc powder and water in the presence of samarium triiodide facilitates highly selective ammonia production over dihydrogen under ambient reaction conditions, yielding up to 900 equiv of ammonia per Mo atom in the catalyst. Intriguingly, using magnesium powder, known for its potent reducing capability, reduces the requisite amount of samarium compounds to catalytic levels. We believe that the novel insights gained from this reaction system represent a substantial step toward achieving green ammonia production.

&lt;p&gt;Here, we discovered the first molybdenum-catalyzed nitrogen fixation with inexpensive and easy-to-handle zero-valent metal powders and alcohols or water in the presence of a catalytic amount of samarium compounds, where more than 1000 equiv of ammonia were formed based on the molybdenum atom of the catalyst. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have recently achieved a highly effective ammonia formation from dinitrogen using samarium diiodide and water under ambient reaction conditions. However, further research is needed to establish a carbon-free green ammonia production route without carbon dioxide emissions. In this study, we have developed a novel molybdenum-catalyzed nitrogen fixation method using a combination of zero-valent metal powders as reductants and alcohols or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as a proton source under ambient reaction conditions. In this reaction system, samarium compounds serve as crucial electron mediators for the molybdenum complexes. Remarkably, the combination of zinc powder and water in the presence of samarium triiodide facilitates highly selective ammonia production over dihydrogen under ambient reaction conditions, yielding up to 900 equiv of ammonia per Mo atom in the catalyst. Intriguingly, using magnesium powder, known for its potent reducing capability, reduces the requisite amount of samarium compounds to catalytic levels.

         <title>Explainable Synthesizability Prediction of Inorganic Crystal Polymorphs Using Large Language Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We utilized LLMs for structure&#8208;based general synthesizability prediction along with their explanations. Fine&#8208;tuned LLMs and LLM&#8208;embedding&#8208;based bespoke ML models showed promising performance compared to the traditional graph&#8208;based bespoke ML models. Furthermore, fine&#8208;tuned LLMs can provide explainability by inferring the reasons for determining the synthesizability with simple prompts. 








Abstract
We evaluate the ability of machine learning to predict whether a hypothetical crystal structure can be synthesized and explain those predictions to scientists. Fine&#8208;tuned large language models (LLMs) trained on a human&#8208;readable text description of the target crystal structure perform comparably to previous bespoke convolutional graph neural network methods, but better prediction quality can be achieved by training a positive&#8208;unlabeled learning model on a text&#8208;embedding representation of the structure. An LLM&#8208;based workflow can then be used to generate human&#8208;readable explanations for the types of factors governing synthesizability, extract the underlying physical rules, and assess the veracity of those rules. These explanations can guide chemists in modifying or optimizing non&#8208;synthesizable hypothetical structures to make them more feasible for materials design.

         <title>Trap&#8208;Enabled Long Exciton Lifetime in Low&#8208;Toxicity Quantum Dots for Enhanced Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing surface traps onto the low&#8208;toxicity ZnSe&#8208;based quantum dots, the excitation energy circulates between exciton states and trap states, leading to trap&#8208;state&#8208;mediated thermally activated delayed photoluminescence. The applications of triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion and [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction were achieved by leveraging the long excited&#8208;state lifetime of delayed photoluminescence.








Abstract
Prolonging exciton lifetime in colloidal quantum dots (QDs) is crucial to their photochemical applications. Previously, this was achieved through a mechanism called thermally activated delayed photoluminescence (TADPL) for QDs surface&#8208;anchored with molecular triplet energy acceptors, in which the molecular triplets sensitized by QDs can repopulate QD&#8208;excitons through thermally activated reverse energy transfer. Here, we demonstrate a novel TADPL mechanism achieved by engineering the surface trap states of QDs. Rapid exciton trapping and thermally activated slow detrapping prolong the exciton lifetime of low&#8208;toxicity ZnSe&#8208;based QDs from the timescale of &#8764;10&#160;ns to &#8764;100&#160;&#181;s. Such a long exciton lifetime allows direct engagement of QDs in diffusion&#8208;assisted energy transfer, without needing surface&#8208;anchored molecules as triplet transmitters, for solution&#8208;phase photochemical applications such as photon upconversion and [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition. This advantage not only greatly streamlines the design of QD&#8208;based photochemical systems but also avoids the reliability issue associated with the anchoring between QDs and molecules, as well as enabling facile tuning of the TADPL wavelength range not limited by the availability of molecular triplet acceptors.

         <title>A Highly Crystalline Covalent Organic Framework With Rich Redox Active Sites as Cathode Material for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly crystalline truxenone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) with rich redox active sites has been designed and prepared. Experiments and calculations reveal that C&#9552;O and C&#9552;N groups are active sites during discharge/charge processes. The TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF can store 27 Li+ ions in one ring and deliver a high discharge capacity of 435 mAh g&#8722;1. This work provides a facile method to achieve high&#8208;capacity COF cathodes for lithium batteries.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been regarded as promising cathode materials for lithium batteries. However, they generally show low practical capacity. Here, the design, preparation, and battery application of a highly crystalline 2D truxenone&#8208;based COF (TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) with rich redox active sites, realizing a high practical capacity is reported. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the lithiation reaction proceeds successively on C&#9552;O and C&#9552;N groups of TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF. One ring of TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF can theoretically store 27 Li+ ions through two stages. Consequently, the highly crystalline TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF displays a high discharge capacity of 435 mAh g&#8722;1 when used as a cathode material for lithium batteries. This work provides a facile approach to achieve COF electrode materials with high practical capacity for lithium batteries.

         <title>Highly Ordered Polymorphism of Small Molecule Acceptor Delivering Efficient and Stable Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach employing 4&#8208;bromochlorobenzene as a volatile solid additive enables the formation of highly ordered BTP&#8208;eC9 polymorphic crystals at low annealing temperatures. This enhances PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 active layer morphology, achieving a PCE of 20.32% with antireflection layers and exceptional device stability, advancing scalable strategies for high&#8208;performance OSCs.








Abstract
Advancements in narrow bandgap organic small molecule acceptors (SMAs) has promoted organic solar cell (OSC) efficiencies beyond 20%. Achieving this milestone necessitates precise control over the active layer morphology, particularly its crystallinity and phase distribution, to optimize light absorption, charge transport, and suppress charge recombination. However, controlling SMA morphology remains a significant challenge due to their strong aggregation tendency. Existing methods, including high&#8208;temperature annealing, and introducing high boiling point additives, frequently yield disordered polymorphs with limited scalability. Here, we report a novel approach of utilizing 4&#8208;bromochlorobenzene as a volatile solid additive to induce the formation of a highly ordered polymorph of BTP&#8208;eC9 through mild annealing at 60 &#176;C. This marks the first demonstration of such an ordered SMA polymorph, exhibiting optical properties comparable to ideal crystals, including enhanced anisotropy, refractive index, and extinction coefficients. The specific polymorph further enables the formation of a well&#8208;organized PM6 donor arrangement, establishing an optimal bicontinuous network morphology. Consequently, the OSCs based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 achieve a power conversion efficiency of 19.53%, which further increases to 20.32% with the addition of an antireflection layer. This work provides a scalable and effective strategy for enhancing OSC performance and highlights the critical role of polymorphism in optimizing photovoltaic performance.

         <title>Prediction and Validation of Mechanical Flexibility in Molecular Crystals: Dispersion Interactions Dictate Bending</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational prediction of mechanical flexibility in molecular crystals based on anisotropy in interaction topology and their experimental validation reveals certain fundamental features of the origin of bending. Analyses based on interaction anisotropy indices and interaction components show that despite stronger electrostatic motifs, the bending in these crystals is still governed by dispersion forces. 








Abstract
Mechanically flexible crystals are a rapidly growing class of functional molecular materials. Typically, such flexible crystals are discovered by serendipity. Herein, we have predicted mechanical flexibility in a series of molecular crystals based on a structure screening approach that combines interaction topology and the presence of nitrile&#183;&#183;&#183;nitrile interactions&#8212;a supramolecular motif hitherto not associated with bending property. Further, we have experimentally validated plastic/elastic bending properties in a series of crystal structures thus predicted. However, four out of five of these crystals showed the bending direction along &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking despite the fact that the direction of strongest interaction anisotropy was rendered by the nitrile&#183;&#183;&#183;nitrile interaction motifs. This is contrary to the commonly perceived anisotropy model and underscores the dominant role of dispersion forces over the electrostatically stabilized motifs in dictating the bending phenomena in molecular crystals. The interaction energies of these motifs have been evaluated using accurate structures from X&#8208;ray quantum crystallography. Analyses combining elastic tensors, interaction anisotropy indices, thermal expansion studies, and high&#8208;pressure simulations quantify the relative roles of the nitrile&#183;&#183;&#183;nitrile motif and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking in mechanical flexibility. Our results point to the possibility of expanding the realm of flexible molecular materials to novel structural types aided by predictive computational models.

         <title>Compensating K Ions Through an Organic Salt in Electrolytes for Practical K&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
KSCN, with a low decomposition potential and high solubility in electrolytes, undergoes an oxidative reaction at 3.6&#160;V during the initial charging, releasing active K&#8208;ion and an electrolyte cosolvent (SCN)2. This electrolyte&#8208;based K&#8208;ion compensation approach is compatible with the entire battery system, allowing seamlessly integration into existing battery technologies.








Abstract
K&#8208;ion batteries face significant challenges due to a severe shortage of active K ions, with cathode materials typically containing less than 70%&#160;K ions and first&#8208;cycle irreversible reactions consuming up to 20% more. Conventional K&#8208;ion compensation methods fail to supply sufficient K ions without compromising cell integrity. To address this, we introduce potassium sulfocyanate (KSCN) as an electrolyte additive capable of delivering up to 100% active K ions. During initial charging, KSCN undergoes oxidative decomposition at 3.6&#160;V, releasing active K ions and forming the cosolvent thiocyanogen ((SCN)2). This molecule, meeting diverse electrochemical properties, was identified using unsupervised machine learning and cheminformatics. The approach demonstrated full KSCN conversion and excellent compatibility with all cell components. The presence of (SCN)2 cosolvent enhanced the rate capability of anodes by promoting K&#8208;ion desolvation. In a hard carbon|K0.5Mg0.15[Mn0.8Mg0.05]O2 pouch cell, this approach tripled the capacity through supplying 58% active K ions, showcasing a practical solution for active K&#8208;ion compensation in K&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Shelled Hollow Covalent Organic Framework Nanospheres for Stable Potassium Storage</title>

A template&#8208;free synthesis of MH&#8208;COFs is reported. Treating the designed crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneous covalent organic polymer nanospheres (COPs) with acetic acid solution produces hollow COFs. Subsequent expansion through seeded growth and acid treatment yields MH&#8208;COFs, whose applied implication is demonstrated by an MH&#8208;COFs/S composite as stable high&#8208;capacity K&#8208;ion battery anodes. 








Abstract
Multi&#8208;shelled hollow covalent organic framework nanospheres (MH&#8208;COFs) with at least two shells integrate the merits of the porous crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) matrix with the complex hollow architecture, which can motivate new functions for exceptional performance. However, the fabrication of MH&#8208;COFs is still uncultivated and remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we reported a facile template&#8208;free protocol for the general synthesis of different MH&#8208;COFs by controlling the simultaneous processes of surface crystallization and core etching of the crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneity nanospheres of COFs precursor. The crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneity solid covalent organic polymer nanospheres (COPs) with robust crystalline surface but vulnerable amorphous core were designed. Subsequently, an acetic acid aqueous solution treatment of crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneity COPs not only induced selective etching of the vulnerable cores but also promote the further crystallization of the surface layers, thereby producing hollow COFs. A further step&#8208;by&#8208;step expansion of seeded growth for inhomogeneous COP layers and then similar acid solution treatment can output the intriguing MH&#8208;COFs. An extraordinarily stable K&#8208;ion battery anode with high capacity was demonstrated with a MH&#8208;COFs/S nanocomposite fabricated by covalently bonding chain sulfur into the MH&#8208;COFs matrix. This work opened a simple but powerful avenue in designing complex hollow COFs architectures to boost their potential for applications.

         <title>Electronic Excitation and High&#8208;Energy Reactions Originate From Anionic Microdroplets Formed by Electrospray or Pneumatic Nebulization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

Droplet evaporation can lead to ion emission or droplet fission. In negatively charged droplets, charge can also be lost through electron emission. These ejected electrons can subsequently lead to ionization or electronic excitation in excess of 10&#160;eV.








Abstract
Formation of energetic species at the surface of aqueous microdroplets, including abundant hydroxyl radicals, oxidation products, and ionized N2 and O2 gas, has been previously attributed to the high electric field at the droplet surface. Here, evidence for a new mechanism for electronic excitation involving electron emission from negatively charged water droplets is shown. Droplet evaporation can lead to the emission of ions and droplet fission, but unlike positively charged droplets, negatively charged droplets can also shed charge by electron emission. With nanoelectrospray, no anions or negatively charged droplets are produced with a positive electrospray potential. In contrast, abundant O2+&#8226; and H3O+(H2O) are formed with negative electrospray. When toluene vapor is introduced with negative electrospray, abundant toluene radical cations and fragments are produced. Both O2+&#8226; and toluene radical cations are produced with pneumatic nebulization. The electrons produced from evaporating negatively charged droplets can be accelerated by an external electric field in electrospray, or by the field generated between droplets with opposite polarities produced by pneumatic nebulization. This electron emission/ionization mechanism leads to electronic excitation &gt;10&#160;eV, and it may explain some of the surprising chemistries that were previously attributed to the high intrinsic electric field at the surface of aqueous droplets.

         <title>In&#8208;Cell Fast Photochemical Oxidation Interrogates the Native Structure of Integral Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

IC&#8208;FPOMP (In&#8208;Cell Fast Photochemical Oxidation of Membrane Proteins) enables rapid, free&#8208;radical footprinting upon laser irradiation of integral membrane proteins (IMPs) in live cells by using TiO&#8322; nanoparticles or H2O2. IC&#8208;FP achieves broad coverage on a human glucose transporter and an enzyme (gamma glutamyl carboxylase), revealing conformational dynamics and interactions with drugs.








Abstract
Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are pivotal for cellular functions but challenging to investigate. Here, IC&#8208;FPOMP (in&#8208;cell fast photochemical oxidation of MPs) is introduced, a method enabling in situ footprinting of IMPs within live cells. IC&#8208;FPOMP generates reactive oxygen radicals from various precursors (TiO2 nanoparticles or H2O2) near the membrane. Leveraging a laser and a 96&#8208;well plate platform, high&#8208;throughput and rapid footprinting of IMPs are achieved. IC&#8208;FPOMP of two human IMPs (human glucose transporter&#8208;hGLUT1 and human gamma&#8208;glutamyl carboxylase&#8208;hGGCX) are successful, providing footprinting of both the transmembrane and extramembrane regions. Comparative analysis of hGLUT1 in liposomes versus cells shows that the membrane may impact the transporter&#8216;s conformation differently. In&#8208;cell drug screening targeting hGLUT1 reveals drug&#8208;binding behavior in vivo. In summary, IC&#8208;FPOMP offers insights into IMP structure&#8208;function relationships in cells and facilitates drug discovery.

&lt;p&gt;IC-FPOMP (In-Cell Fast Photochemical Oxidation of Membrane Proteins) enables rapid, free-radical footprinting upon laser irradiation of integral membrane proteins (IMPs) in live cells by using TiO&#8322; nanoparticles or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. IC-FP achieves broad coverage on a human glucose transporter and an enzyme (gamma glutamyl carboxylase), revealing conformational dynamics and interactions with drugs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are pivotal for cellular functions but challenging to investigate. Here, IC-FPOMP (in-cell fast photochemical oxidation of MPs) is introduced, a method enabling in situ footprinting of IMPs within live cells. IC-FPOMP generates reactive oxygen radicals from various precursors (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) near the membrane. Leveraging a laser and a 96-well plate platform, high-throughput and rapid footprinting of IMPs are achieved. IC-FPOMP of two human IMPs (human glucose transporter-hGLUT1 and human gamma-glutamyl carboxylase-hGGCX) are successful, providing footprinting of both the transmembrane and extramembrane regions. Comparative analysis of hGLUT1 in liposomes versus cells shows that the membrane may impact the transporter&#8216;s conformation differently. In-cell drug screening targeting hGLUT1 reveals drug-binding behavior in vivo. In summary, IC-FPOMP offers insights into IMP structure-function relationships in cells and facilitates drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This work demonstrates an unprecedented comprehensive monitoring of the elementary reaction pathways of the SN1 solvolysis on an in situ real&#8208;time single&#8208;molecule electrical detection platform. Through precise electrostatic catalysis, we capture two short&#8208;lived protonated intermediates at the single&#8208;molecule level and reveal the crucial role of the proton tunneling effect in the interconversion of these two intermediates. This study offers a unique route to discover novel phenomena and unveil the intrinsic mechanisms in the processes of material transformation and life activities.








Abstract
A central goal of chemical mechanism research is to provide a comprehensive interpretation of chemical reaction pathways to clarify the evolution patterns of reactions. In this work, we present an unprecedented comprehensive monitoring of the elementary reaction pathways of the SN1 solvolysis on an in situ real&#8208;time single&#8208;molecule electrical detection platform. Through precise control of oriented external electric fields, we capture two short&#8208;lived protonated intermediates at the single&#8208;molecule level and elucidate their roles in the reaction. Both temperature&#8208; and isotope&#8208;dependent experiments, in combination with theoretical simulations, reveal crucial roles for the hydrogen&#8208;bonded acetic&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton&#8208;transfer and the proton tunneling effect in the interconversion of these two intermediates. This work highlights the precise manipulation of chemical reactions by electrostatic fields and opens up a universal route to discover unknown intermediates or novel phenomena in the processes of material transformation and life activities.

         <title>Size Effect of Surface Defects Dictates Reactivity for Nitrogen Electrofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Medium&#8208;sized defects on VOx surfaces achieve an optimal synergy between electronic and geometric properties, enhancing N2 adsorption, activation, and hydrogenation while effectively suppressing HER. This results in remarkable eNRR activity and selectivity. A well&#8208;defined structure&#8211;activity relationship underscores the critical role of defect size in eNRR performance. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) offers a sustainable pathway for ammonia (NH3) production. Defect engineering enhances eNRR activity but can concurrently amplify the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), posing challenges for achieving high selectivity. Herein, VOx with systematically tuned defect sizes is engineered to establish a structure&#8211;activity relationship between defect size and eNRR performance. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that medium&#8208;sized defects (VOx&#8208;MD, 1&#8211;2 nm) provide an optimal electronic environment for enhanced N2 adsorption and activation while maintaining spatial flexibility to facilitate efficient hydrogenation. Consequently, VOx&#8208;MD exhibits outstanding eNRR performance, achieving an NH3 yield rate of 81.94&#160;&#177; 1.45&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 31.97&#160;&#177; 0.75&#160;% at &#8722;0.5 V (vs RHE). These findings highlight the critical role of defect size in governing eNRR activity, offering a scalable strategy for designing advanced catalysts for competitve electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Enantioconvergent Hydroallylation of Acrylates Enabled by &#947;&#8208;Silyl&#8208;Substituted Allyl Acetates</title>

         <dc:description>
Regio&#8208; and enantioconvergent hydroallylation of acylates under Cu/Pd synergistic catalysis is reported. The incorporation of a silyl group into allyl acetates precisely controls regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity through steric hindrance. Subsequent transformation of the silyl group in the product enables the regioselective synthesis of allylated products bearing two distinct yet structurally similar aryl groups.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution provides an efficient route to chiral organic molecules featuring an allyl moiety, key intermediates in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. However, the use of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allyl electrophiles has been severely constrained by the challenges of achieving both regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity simultaneously. Herein, we present &#947;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allyl acetates as highly effective electrophiles for a regio&#8208; and enantioconvergent hydroallylation, enabling the construction of vicinal stereogenic centers. This method delivers allylated products in 44%&#8211;93% yield with 79:21 to &gt;95:5 dr and 88% to &gt;99% ee. Additionally, the silyl group in the products can be readily converted into other functional groups, such as acyl and aryl groups, enhancing their synthetic utility.

         <title>Spin Polarization&#8208;Boosting Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics and Exciton Dissociation in Fe Nanoparticle&#8208;Loading Graphitic Carbon Nitride Toward Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin polarization of electrons is introduced to accelerate the exciton dissociation&#160;and the spin&#8208;selective electron transfer in CN/Fe nanohybrids to enhance selective CO2 photoreduction into CO, during which the oxidized Fe2+/Fe3+ pairs on the surface of Fe nanoparticles serve as ultrafast charge transfer shuttles via double exchange interaction.








Abstract
The regulation of exciton properties plays a crucial role in enhancing the activity of photocatalysts, primarily due to the rapid recombination of photoinduced electron&#8211;hole pairs caused by the strong Coulomb interaction between them. In this study, we explore the spin polarization effect in nanohybrids composed of graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C&#8323;N&#8324;) and iron (Fe) nanoparticles, which accelerates exciton dissociation and spin&#8208;selective electron transfer, thereby improving the selective photoreduction of CO&#8322; into CO. Mechanistic studies reveal that the Fe2&#8314;/Fe3&#8314; redox pairs, embedded in the iron oxide layer on the surface of Fe nanoparticles, function as ultrafast charge transfer shuttles via a double exchange interaction (Fe2&#8314;&#9472;O&#9472;Fe3&#8314;). This process facilitates spin&#8208;selective electron transfer from g&#8208;C&#8323;N&#8324; to Fe species, thereby contributing to the efficient conversion of CO&#8322;. This work provides novel insights into the design of spin&#8208;dependent photocatalysts for efficient solar energy conversion.

         <title>Regulating the Dynamics of Interpenetrated Porous Frameworks for Inverse C2H6/C2H4 Separation at Elevated Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust and scalable porous crystal has demonstrated an unprecedented ability for inverse separation of C2H6/C2H4 at 328&#160;K, as the shifting degree of the H&#8208;bonded interpenetrated frameworks, which determines the width of the narrow neck, can be finely regulated under the gas stimulus across a broad and elevated temperature range.








Abstract
Selective adsorption of ethane (C2H6) from mixtures containing ethylene (C2H4) is of interest for the direct production of high purity C2H4. However, the extremely similar molecular properties of these gases make this process challenging, particularly at elevated temperatures, an implication of saved energy consumption. To address such challenge, we present a new approach for regulating the temperature&#8208;dependent dynamics in hydrogen&#8208;bonded interpenetrated frameworks. As a single H&#8208;bond linked interpenetrated porous framework, NTU&#8208;101&#8208;NH2 exhibits emerging structural dynamics in response to C2H6 (37&#160;kPa) and C2H4 (53&#160;kPa) and has shown a record ability to produce polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (15.7&#160;mL g&#8722;1) at 328&#160;K, as the shifting of the interpenetrated frameworks here requires a relatively weak stimulus, allowing the optimization of adsorption at a higher temperatures range. Meanwhile, the robust and conveniently prepared NTU&#8208;101&#8208;NH2 shows good cyclic separation performance. In comparison, the framework response of the percussor NTU&#8208;101, connected by three H&#8208;bonds, occurs at 293&#160;K and has a moderate separation ability (10.2&#160;mL g&#8722;1). This work showcases the first adsorbent for direct C2H4 purification at elevated temperatures, and the insights into the hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks will pave the way for designing soft families capable of challenging separations with reduced energy requirements.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Driven Ferroelectric Coordination Polymer Exhibiting Distinct Phase Transitions Under Thermal and Pressure Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the first example of a 1D spiro&#8208;based ferroelectric coordination polymer, which exhibits distinct phase transitions under thermal or pressure stimuli, triggered by the flipping of a spiro ring fragment as well as the deformation of the main chain.








Abstract
Controllable strategies for the design of molecular ferroelectrics have been actively pursued in recent years due to their promising applications in modern electronic devices. In this work, we present a spiro&#8208;driven approach for the design of a new class of molecular ferroelectrics. Using 2&#8208;morpholinoethanol (MEO) as a bidentate chelating ligand and the SCN&#8315; anion as a bridging co&#8208;ligand, we obtained a neutral chain&#8208;like ferroelectric coordination polymer, [Cd(MEO)(SCN)&#8322;]. Interestingly, it undergoes both a thermal&#8208;induced phase transition, driven by ring&#8208;conformational flipping of the spiro&#8208;like [Cd(MEO)] fragment, and a pressure&#8208;induced transition, triggered by significant deformation of the spring&#8208;like [Cd(SCN)&#8322;]&#8734; helical chain. Unlike most previously reported ferroelectric coordination polymers, which often rely on organic cationic guests, this work introduces a new avenue for designing neutral ferroelectric coordination polymers. Overall, the spiro&#8208;driven strategy provides valuable insights and a novel structural motif for the development of advanced molecular ferroelectrics.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly for Bimodal In Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, rationally designed self&#8208;assembled dyes are introduced&#8212;which offer controllable aggregate sizes and tunable NIR absorption and emission&#8212;as a unique and efficient platform for simultaneous multimodal [fluorescence reflectance imaging (FRI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI)] and multiscale (50&#160;nm&#8211;1&#160;&#181;m) biomedical imaging.








Abstract
Contrast agents (CAs) are essential in biomedical imaging to aid in the diagnosis and therapy monitoring of disease. However, they are typically restricted to one imaging modality and have fixed properties such as size, shape, toxicity profile, or photophysical characteristics, which hampers a comprehensive view of biological processes. Herein, rationally designed dye assemblies are introduced as a unique CA platform for simultaneous multimodal and multiscale biomedical imaging. To this end, a series of amphiphilic aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes are synthesized with varying hydrophobic domains (C1, C8, C12, and C16) that self&#8208;assemble in aqueous media into nanostructures of tunable size (50&#160;nm&#8211;1&#160;&#181;m) and photophysical properties. While C1 exhibits oblique&#8208;type exciton coupling and negligible emission, C8&#8208;C16 bearing longer alkyl chains undergo J&#8208;type aggregation with NIR absorption and emission and excellent photoacoustic properties. Given these advantageous features, aza&#8208;BODIPY specific, semi&#8208;quantitative fluorescence reflectance and photoacoustic imaging both in vitro and in vivo are established. Additionally, in vitro cell viability as well as murine in vivo biodistribution analysis with ex vivo validation showed excellent biocompatibility and a size&#8208;dependent biodistribution of nanostructures to different organ beds. These results broaden the scope of aqueous self&#8208;assembly to multimodal imaging and highlight its great potential for rationalizing numerous biomedical questions.

         <title>Assembly of Functionalized Organic Fragments via Reductive Activation and (Cross)&#8208;Coupling of C2H4, CO, CO2 and/or H2 Using a Magnesium&#8208;Dinitrogen Complex</title>

A dimagnesium/dipotassium complex of N2 acts as a &#8220;masked&#8221; source of a dimagnesium(I) diradical in formal reductive coupling and cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving various combinations of the simple gaseous small molecules, C2H4, CO, CO2, and H2. A range of more complex &#8220;value&#8208;added&#8221; organic fragments have been accessed from these processes.








Abstract
Reactions of 1,2&#8208;dimagnesioethane compound [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;C2H4)] (TCHPNON = 4,5&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene), formed by the two&#8208;electron reduction of ethene with a dimagnesium/dipotassium complex of reduced N2, viz. [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)], with CO and CO2 have been explored. In the case of the reaction with CO, cross&#8208;coupling of the reduced ethene fragment with two molecules of CO gave a heterobimetallic complex of the parent cyclobutenediolate dianion, [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O2C4H4)], which when exposed to THF gave adduct [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O2C4H4)(THF)]. Treating [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;C2H4)] with CO2 led to the insertion of CO2 into both Mg&#9472;C bonds and all Mg&#9472;N bonds, yielding a magnesium succinate complex, [{K(TCHPNON&#8208;C2O4)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O4C4H4)], in which the diamide ligands have been converted to xanthene bridged dicarbamates. The reaction of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] with CO2, proceeded via reductive coupling of the heterocumulene to give the oxalate dianion, in addition to the insertion of CO2 into all Mg&#9472;N bonds of the magnesium&#8208;dinitrogen complex, forming dimeric [{K(TCHPNON&#8208;C2O4)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O4C2)]2. When treated with THF this yields monomeric [{K(THF)(TCHPNON&#8208;C2O4)Mg(THF)}2(&#956;&#8208;O4C2)]. Related chemistry results from the reaction of a dianionic magnesium(I) compound with CO2. In contrast, C&#9472;C bond formation was not observed in the reaction of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] with a CO2 analog, i.e., the carbodiimide CyNCNCy (Cy = cyclohexyl). Instead, H abstraction by a proposed radical intermediate gave polymeric formamidinate complex [K(TCHPNON)Mg{(CyN)2CH}]&#8734;. Reaction of CO2 with the magnesium hydride complex [{K(TCHPNON)Mg(&#956;&#8208;H)}2] gave the unusual trimeric magnesium formate complex [{K(TCHPNON&#8208;CO2)Mg}(&#956;&#8208;O2CH)]3 in which CO2 has inserted into only one Mg&#9472;N bond of each TCHPNON ligand. This study highlights the capacity of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] to act as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in reductive coupling or cross&#8208;coupling of the simple gaseous reagents, C2H4, CO, CO2 and H2, to give value&#8208;added organic fragments.

&lt;p&gt;Reactions of 1,2-dimagnesioethane compound [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON = 4,5-bis(2,4,6-tricyclohexylanilido)-2,7-diethyl-9,9-dimethyl-xanthene), formed by the two-electron reduction of ethene with a dimagnesium/dipotassium complex of reduced N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, viz. [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)], with CO and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have been explored. In the case of the reaction with CO, cross-coupling of the reduced ethene fragment with two molecules of CO gave a heterobimetallic complex of the parent cyclobutenediolate dianion, [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)], which when exposed to THF gave adduct [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(THF)]. Treating [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)] with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; led to the insertion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into both Mg&#9472;C bonds and all Mg&#9472;N bonds, yielding a magnesium succinate complex, [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)], in which the diamide ligands have been converted to xanthene bridged dicarbamates. The reaction of [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, proceeded via reductive coupling of the heterocumulene to give the oxalate dianion, in addition to the insertion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into all Mg&#9472;N bonds of the magnesium-dinitrogen complex, forming dimeric [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. When treated with THF this yields monomeric [{K(THF)(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)Mg(THF)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]. Related chemistry results from the reaction of a dianionic magnesium(I) compound with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In contrast, C&#9472;C bond formation was not observed in the reaction of [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] with a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; analog, i.e., the carbodiimide CyNCNCy (Cy = cyclohexyl). Instead, H abstraction by a proposed radical intermediate gave polymeric formamidinate complex [K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg{(CyN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH}]&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt;. Reaction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the magnesium hydride complex [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg(&#956;-H)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] gave the unusual trimeric magnesium formate complex [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Mg}(&#956;-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH)]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in which CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has inserted into only one Mg&#9472;N bond of each &lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON ligand. This study highlights the capacity of [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] to act as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in reductive coupling or cross-coupling of the simple gaseous reagents, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to give value-added organic fragments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advancing Propylene Epoxidation: the Role of Ethyl Acetate Autoxidation via Cobalt&#8208;Nickel Catalyzed C(acyl)&#9472;O Bond Scission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt/nickel catalytic aerobic epoxidation of propylene is described, where the autoxidation of carboxyl esters, as in ethyl acetate, ultimately provides peracetic acid as the oxidizing reagent, resulting in a remarkable epoxide selectivity. The confirmed Co(III)/Co(II) active center is stabilized through its interaction with nickel, involvement in the oxidation of the ethoxy radical (an intermediate from the ester C&#9472;O bond cleavage), as well as the single&#8208;electron reduction of oxygen.








Abstract
The selective autoxidation for the synthesis of valuable oxygenates has provoked keen interest from both academic and industrial sectors. Although the generation of reactive oxygen species via oxygen attack on C&#9472;H bonds near ester linkages is well&#8208;established, research into aliphatic ester oxidation has primarily focused on combustion, neglecting their potential utility in oxidation processes. Herein, a protocol for producing propylene oxide through the autoxidation of ethyl acetate in tandem with propylene epoxidation is demonstrated. The ethoxy radical, generated by ester C(acyl)&#9472;O bond cleavage in situ, subsequently underwent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer with the Co(OAc)(&#956;&#8208;H2O)2Ni, followed by the formation of the peracetic acid optimally suited for the epoxidation reaction. The research not only eliminates the need for co&#8208;substrates in the epoxidation process but also fills the application gap in bulk&#8208;ester autoxidation, offering insights into the effective utilization of oxy&#8208;intermediates in autoxidation reactions.

         <title>Controlled Anodic Decomposition Pathway of Supramolecular Lithium Borate for Rationally Tuned Interphase Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular lithium borate which features a polydentate structure is reported here. The reversible supramolecular chelating/de&#8208;chelating of Li&#8314; enables the sequentially controlled cleavage pathway of B&#9472;O and C&#9472;O bonds. Therefore, a homogeneous and robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase, rich in lithium boron&#8211;oxygen clusters and LiF is rationally fabricated. The precise control over interfacial chemistry significantly enhances interfacial protection, thereby improving battery cycling stability.








Abstract
The rational tailoring and molecular&#8208;level engineering of stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphases (CEIs) is paramount to advancing the performance of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy, layered nickel&#8208;rich oxide&#8208;based lithium metal batteries. However, developing well&#8208;tailored electrolyte additives with rationally controlled interfacial chemistry remains highly challenging. Here, two lithium borates: lithium (2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)trifluoroborate (C&#8208;LiMCFB) and lithium (15&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2,5,8,11,14&#8208;pentaoxahexadecan)trifluoroborate (L&#8208;LiMCFB), incorporating cyclic 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (15C5) and linear pentaethylene glycol monomethyl ether (PEGME) as respective host groups tethered to the boron center are designed and synthesized. In C&#8208;LiMCFB, the supramolecular polydentate chelation/de&#8208;chelation of the 15C5 with Li+ can sequentially deactivate/activate the anodic decomposition of the C&#9472;O bonds, therefore leading to the controlled cleavage pathway of B&#9472;O and C&#9472;O bonds. The controlled interfacial chemistry leads to the formation of a uniform CEI layer, rich in lithium boron&#8211;oxygen clusters interwoven with LiF, on the NCM811 surface. This novel CEI configuration demonstrates an exceptional balance of mechanical robustness, adhesiveness, and toughness, providing highly desirable protection for the NCM811 cathode. The discovery of these novel supramolecular boron&#8208;based lithium salts not only unlocks supramolecular chemistry for rational electrolyte tuning but also provides a deeper understanding of the CEI formation mechanism in high&#8208;energy lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Cerium&#8208;Mediated C&#9472;C Bond Cleavage for the Deconstructive Diversification of Cyclic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The decarboxylative ring&#8208;opening functionalization of strained and non&#8208;strained cyclic tertiary acids (3&#8211;12&#8208;membered rings) under Ce/photocatalysis, with air as the sole oxidant, is reported. This strategy enables the construction of C&#9472;CN, carbon&#8211;halide, C&#9472;C, C&#9472;Se, and carbon&#9472;oxime bonds to form various functionalized carbonyl compounds. Late&#8208;stage modifications generate valuable molecular modules, providing a pathway for antipsychotic drug synthesis. 








Abstract
The selective cleavage of inert carbon&#8208;carbon bonds in unstrained rings continues to pose a formidable challenge in chemical synthesis. Current methods for C(sp3) &#9472;C(sp3) bond cleavage are highly limited, typically relying on transition&#8208;metal catalysis to facilitate ring&#8208;opening via small&#8208;ring strain or inducing &#946;&#8208;fragmentation after generating radicals from oxygen or nitrogen atoms pre&#8208;installed in the substrate. Herein, we introduce an effective strategy for the decarboxylative ring&#8208;opening functionalization of &#945;&#8208;trisubstituted carboxylic acids, mediated by both light and cerium. This method enables the ring&#8208;opening of carboxylic acids with ring sizes ranging from 3 to 12 members, allowing the construction of C&#9472;CN, C&#8208;halide, C&#9472;C, C&#9472;Se, and C&#9472;oxime bonds. Notably, this reaction does not require the pre&#8208;installation of an oxygen atom in the substrate, as the carbonyl group is derived from atmospheric oxygen. Furthermore, late&#8208;stage modification establishes distally functionalized carbonyl compounds, which serve as versatile synthons for accessing valuable building blocks.

         <title>Exploiting Antisite Defects in FeWN2 Nanosheets for Enol Electro&#8208;oxidation Coupled with H2 Evolution at a Large Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel layered 2D FeWN2 electrocatalyst with a rock&#8208;salt structure and abundant antisite defects is designed to enhance the electrocatalytic upgrading of ascorbic acid (AA) to dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). The presence of antisite defects effectively modulates the electronic structure, facilitating the activation of enol groups in AA.








Abstract
Hydrogen production from biomass electro&#8208;oxidation offers a promising alternative to water electrolysis by lowering the anodic oxidation barrier and producing valuable chemicals. However, current biomass electro&#8208;oxidation systems have difficulties in achieving an industrial&#8208;scale current density due to the difficulty in cleaving high&#8208;energy C&#9472;H and O&#9472;H bonds. Here, we report a ternary layer nitride FeWN2 electrocatalyst with abundant antisite defects (ASDs), which significantly improves its electrocatalytic performance for ascorbic acid (AA) oxidation. The catalyst works at a remarkable current density of 2.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 0.69&#160;V (vs RHE) and achieves 4 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.12&#160;V in a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer at 60 &#176;C with 100% Faraday efficiency for H2 production. Theoretical calculations reveal that W atoms near antipodal Fe sites replenish the electron density of Fe, maintaining moderate Fe&#8208;DHA adsorption strength induced by ASDs that achieve superior catalytic efficiency for AA&#8208;to&#8208;DHA conversion This study provides new insight for developing high&#8208;performance organic oxidation catalysts with ASDs.

         <title>&#8220;Pulsed&#8221; Chain Transfer Anionic Polymerization: A Green and Cost&#8208;Effective Approach for Controlled Polymer Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy significantly enhances catalyst atom economy in living polymerization by introducing intermittent, switchable chain&#8208;transfer reactions. The temperature&#8208;sensitive catalytic system allows multiple regenerations of the initiator without using expensive organometallic compounds such as ZnEt2 or MgBu2. This green and cost&#8208;effective approach achieves up to 1500% initiator efficiency and enables the synthesis of polybutadiene and styrene&#8208;butadiene copolymers with narrow molecular weight distribution, providing a sustainable alternative for producing well&#8208;defined, low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers. 








Abstract
Herein, we report a method that significantly enhances the atom economy of catalysts in living polymerization. By introducing intermittent, switchable chain&#8208;transfer reactions during the polymerization process, multiple regenerations of the catalyst are achieved while preserving the &#8220;living&#8221;/controlled characteristics. The specially designed catalytic system, composed of 1,2&#8208;dipyrrolidinoethane/n&#8208;butyllithium/n&#8208;butylpotassium/toluene, exhibits a chain&#8208;transfer rate that is highly sensitive to temperature. It enables living polymerization at low temperatures, while at high temperatures, rapid chain transfer to toluene occurs. Utilizing this characteristic, polymerization is initially carried out at low temperatures; once the monomer is consumed, increasing the temperature promotes chain transfer, resulting in initiator regeneration. The regenerated initiator can then initiate new cycles of living polymerization upon the addition of fresh monomers. This process was repeated for more than a dozen cycles, achieving an initiator efficiency of up to 1500%. Using this method, we successfully synthesized polybutadiene and styrene&#8208;butadiene copolymer with an extremely narrow molecular weight distribution (&#272; = 1.1). The mechanism was investigated by in situ NMR spectroscopy, MALDI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS, and DFT calculations. This approach is particularly well&#8208;suited for the controllable, green, and cost&#8208;effective production of low&#8208; to medium&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers and block copolymers.

         <title>AIE Bottlebrush Polymers: Verification of Internal Crowdedness in Bottlebrush Polymers Using the AIE Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bottlebrush polymers are a unique class of macromolecules with densely grafted side chains along a central long backbone. A comprehensive understanding of the internal crowdedness within single bottlebrush polymer chains in dilute solutions remains challenging. Here, we synthesized AIEgen&#8208;based bottlebrush polymers using ROMP. The expected AIE phenomenon clearly visualized the steric crowding effect among the densely grafted side chains in bottlebrush polymers.








Abstract
Bottlebrush polymers, characterized by densely grafted side chains along a central backbone, have gained significant interest due to their unique properties in bulk and solution states. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive understanding of the internal crowdedness within single polymer chains in dilute solutions remains challenging, and direct evidence to visualize and manifest this effect is scarce. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) offers a novel method to address this challenge. To achieve this, a vinyl&#8208;derivatized AIE monomer was polymerized using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) in a controlled way. Afterward, the end group of the synthesized polymer chain was transformed to azide, which was coupled with an alkyne&#8208;derivatized norbornene unit using click chemistry to produce the macromonomer. Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of the norbornenyl macromonomer using Grubbs catalyst, (H2IMes)(pyr)2(Cl)2Ru&#160;=&#160;CHPh (G3), resulted in well&#8208;defined bottlebrush polymers in a highly efficient way. We studied the polymerization behavior and characterized the single chain conformation of the bottlebrush polymers in dilute solution together with coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics (CG&#8208;MD) simulation. Photoluminescence investigation of the bottlebrush polymers in dilute solution revealed the expected AIE phenomenon, thus verifying the steric crowding effects within bottlebrush polymers. This work bridges AIE technology with polymer science and especially bottlebrush polymers. By doing this, our research not only broadens the bottlebrush polymer library but also provides insights into bottlebrush polymer chain study for potential applications.

         <title>Enabling Aryl Chloride&#8208;Mediated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first general palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) catalysis with aryl chlorides is achieved by employing a secondary&#8208;amide&#8208;substituted NBE and XPhos ligand, resulting in diverse ortho/ipso difunctionalizations of arenes.








Abstract
While the palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis has become increasingly useful for arene functionalization, its substrate scope has been mainly restricted to reactive aryl iodides and bromides. Despite being a more available and attractive feedstock, common aryl chlorides have not been used as substrates for the Pd/NBE catalysis. Herein, we report the first general Pd/NBE&#8208;catalyzed vicinal difunctionalization of aryl chlorides. Enabled by the combination of secondary&#8208;amide&#8208;substituted NBEs and XPhos ligand, diverse aryl chlorides can now undergo successful ortho alkylation, amination, and acylation with different ipso terminations, including olefination, hydrogenation, and alkynylation. To show the utility of this method, late&#8208;stage derivatizations of complex bioactive compounds and sequential functionalizations of polyhaloarenes have been achieved.

         <title>Precise Tuning of Functional Group Spatial Distribution on Porphyrin Rings for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

The atropisomers o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#945;&#945;&#945; and &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) with dual effects are ingeniously designed to efficiently modulate CO2RR selectivity, leveraging hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance to provide adsorption sites and protect intermediates. As a result, the sterically symmetric o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) interacts with carbonate, prevents C&#8211;C coupling, and exhibits excellent CH4 selectivity.








Abstract
Molecular catalysts play a critical role in regulating the selectivity of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet the understanding of ligand function is largely restricted to modulating the electronic structure of the metal and reaction kinetics. Herein, a hydroxyl (&#9472;OH) ligand is introduced into a sterically hindered amino&#8208;porphyrin (o&#8208;TAPP) to synthesize the atropisomers porphyrin&#8208;salicylimine&#8208;Cu (o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa) with hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions (O&#9472;H&#8943;O), enabling efficient selection of CO and CH4 under dual effects. Detailed analysis shows that the &#9472;OH of o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) forms a noncovalent hydrogen bond with carbonate, characterized by a bond length of 2.01&#160;&#197; and an angle of 27.6&#176;, and this interaction reduces the reaction energy barrier, achieving a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 84% for CH4. Moreover, the steric hindrance effect of the symmetric distribution of &#9472;OH facilitates protonation reactions by preventing C&#8211;C coupling. In contrast, &#9472;OH aggregated on o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#945;&#945;&#945;) forms a pocket&#8208;like hydrogen bond grid, which restricts free CO2 adsorption, and the rapid dissociation of *CO also interrupts the reaction. This work highlights the pivotal role of dual effects induced by ligand atropisomerization in regulating selectivity, offering new insights for the design of efficient molecular catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;The atropisomers o-Cu-Por-Sa (&#945;&#945;&#945;&#945; and &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) with dual effects are ingeniously designed to efficiently modulate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR selectivity, leveraging hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance to provide adsorption sites and protect intermediates. As a result, the sterically symmetric o-Cu-Por-Sa (&#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) interacts with carbonate, prevents C&#8211;C coupling, and exhibits excellent CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity.

         <title>Arrangement of Ordered D&#8211;A Components in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Cocatalyst&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Efficient Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ordered D&#8211;A components in MOFs provide a driving force for the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, resulting in excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity without additional cocatalysts. Due to the arrayed uncoordinated carboxyl groups, D&#8211;A MOFs form dual channels for rapid proton transfer. Efficient charge separation and fast proton transport kinetics of the D&#8211;A MOFs promote the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The arrangement of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) components in order at a molecular level provides a means to achieve efficient electron&#8208;hole separation for promoting the activity of photocatalysts. Herein, we report the coordination assembly of D&#8211;A molecules with desired staggered energy levels in two isostructural metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) 1 and 2, which exhibit high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity without using any cocatalysts and photosensitizers. The modulation of active metal sites of the D&#8211;A MOFs leads to an increase in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates from 1260 to 3218&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1. A detailed mechanism study revealed that the energy bond defined by the D&#8211;A components assisted with metal centers is the key to efficiently generating photogenerated charge carriers, and 2 has an appropriate affinity to proton to reduce the energy barrier for hydrogen evolution. Besides, the enhanced proton transport kinetics based on the arrayed free carboxyl groups in the hydrogen&#8208;bonded network endows 2 with higher proton conductivity than 1, thus promoting the usage rate of active metal sites in 2 for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics.

P&#8594;B motifs are readily and regioselectively appended to pyrene and anthracene.

Abstract
The functionalization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with N&#8594;B Lewis pairs, so&#8208;called borylative fusion, has recently emerged as a simple and powerful means to modulate their electronic and photophysical properties thanks to the extension of the &#960; system. Herein, we considered a new class of PAHs appended with phosphine&#8594;borane Lewis pairs and investigated pyrene as well as anthracene derivatives. In these compounds, strong P&#8594;B interactions are enforced geometrically, but the &#960;&#8208;system is not extended. Nevertheless, such P&#8594;B functionalization was found to significantly impact the optical and electrochemical properties. The P,B&#8208;functionalized PAHs display noticeably reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps and enhanced fluorescence. Both the number and position of P&#8594;B units turned out to play a significant role.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Pt&#8208;based electrocatalyst from commercially available PtCl2 is reported for the electrohydrogenation of olefins under unusual high current density (JGeo up to 133&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) using protons and electrons as the hydrogen source and reductant, respectively. This reaction exhibits broad functional group compatibility and substrate scope. Additionally, highly regioselective electrocatalytic hydrogenation of olefins (r.r.&#160;&gt;&#160;19:1) is demonstrated using PtCl2 and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine.








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis offers a powerful and sustainable alternative to conventional chemical manufacturing techniques. The direct and selective electrohydrogenation of olefins has enormous potential applicability; however, this reactivity has not been sufficiently demonstrated. Herein, we show that an efficient Pt&#8208;based electrocatalyst from commercially available PtCl2 can promote such transformations. This approach enables olefins to be electrohydrogenated (often below &#8722;3.0&#160;V vs. Ag/AgCl) at high current density (JGeo up to 133&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) using protons and electrons as the hydrogen source. This reaction exhibits broad functional group compatibility, requires low catalyst loading, and affords a diverse series of valuable molecules (more than 60 examples) with high chemoselectivity. In addition, highly regioselective electrocatalytic hydrogenation of olefins (r.r.&#160;&gt;&#160;19:1) is demonstrated using PtCl2 and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine.

A readily prepared small molecule, 2,6&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;diethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine, enables rapid and highly sensitive &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence detection of PFOA in water via liquid&#8208;phase extraction. Detection limits as low as 40 ppt in deionized water and 100 ppt in tap water are achieved using a smartphone&#8208;based color scan &#8220;app&#8221;. This method offers a simple and effective approach for trace PFOA detection in aqueous environments.








Abstract
Mounting concerns regarding per&#8208;/poly&#8208;fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on human health are focusing attention on trace&#8208;level PFAS detection in aqueous environments. Here, we report a readily prepared small molecule, 2,6&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;diethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine (receptor 1), that displays high binding affinities (logKa&#160;=&#160;4.9&#8211;6.2) and produces a strong &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; emission response when exposed to representative PFAS in hexanes. The hydrophobic nature of 1, and its strong affinity for various PFAS, allowed hexanes solutions of 1 to be used as &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; emission sensors for dilute aqueous solutions of long&#8208;chain (&#8805;C8) PFAS under acidic conditions (pH 2) by liquid&#8208;phase extraction (LPE). In the case of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the response was rapid (under 10&#160;min) and sensitive. Limits of detection (LOD) as low as 250&#160;ppt were readily achievable by direct naked&#8208;eye observation. LOD as low as 40 and 100&#160;ppt, respectively, could be reached for deionized and tap water solutions of PFOA using a smartphone color&#8208;scanning application. Little change in the sensitivity was seen in the presence of a range of inorganic and organic species that could act as potential interferants. Support for the present findings came from UV&#8211;vis absorbance, fluorescence, 1H/19F NMR spectroscopic analyses, density functional theory calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses.

&lt;p&gt;A readily prepared small molecule, 2,6-bis(3,5-diethyl-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyridine, enables rapid and highly sensitive &#8220;turn-on&#8221; fluorescence detection of PFOA in water via liquid-phase extraction. Detection limits as low as 40 ppt in deionized water and 100 ppt in tap water are achieved using a smartphone-based color scan &#8220;app&#8221;. This method offers a simple and effective approach for trace PFOA detection in aqueous environments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mounting concerns regarding per-/poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on human health are focusing attention on trace-level PFAS detection in aqueous environments. Here, we report a readily prepared small molecule, 2,6-bis(3,5-diethyl-&lt;i&gt;1H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrrol-2-yl)pyridine (receptor &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), that displays high binding affinities (log&lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;4.9&#8211;6.2) and produces a strong &#8220;turn-on&#8221; emission response when exposed to representative PFAS in hexanes. The hydrophobic nature of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, and its strong affinity for various PFAS, allowed hexanes solutions of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; to be used as &#8220;turn-on&#8221; emission sensors for dilute aqueous solutions of long-chain (&#8805;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) PFAS under acidic conditions (pH 2) by liquid-phase extraction (LPE). In the case of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the response was rapid (under 10&#160;min) and sensitive. Limits of detection (LOD) as low as 250&#160;ppt were readily achievable by direct naked-eye observation. LOD as low as 40 and 100&#160;ppt, respectively, could be reached for deionized and tap water solutions of PFOA using a smartphone color-scanning application. Little change in the sensitivity was seen in the presence of a range of inorganic and organic species that could act as potential interferants. Support for the present findings came from UV&#8211;vis absorbance, fluorescence, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H/&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR spectroscopic analyses, density functional theory calculations, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The Doping Yb3&#8314; ions into Ln coordination polymers (Ln&#8208;CPs) with the formula [Y2(FCA)6]n (FCA = 9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid) has led to the preparation of 1D chain Ln&#8208;CPs of [Y2&#8208;2xYb2x(FCA)6]n. Up&#8208;conversion luminescence (UCL) of the ligand is visibly observed in [Y0.6Yb1.4(FCA)6]n, with an absolute up&#8208;conversion quantum yield (UCQY) of 0.003&#160;%.








Abstract
Ln3+&#8208;induced ligand up&#8208;conversion luminescence (UCL) in coordination polymers (CPs) effectively overcomes the inherent limitations of conventional organic UCL mechanisms. However, current research on UCL in Ln&#8208;CPs has predominantly focused on the UCL of Ln3&#8314; ions themselves, while investigations into Ln3&#8314;&#8208;induced ligand UCL is overlooked in Ln&#8208;CPs. Herein, by doping Yb3&#8314; into the Ln&#8208;CPs of [Y2(FCA)6]n 1) (FCA&#160;=&#160;9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid), Yb3+&#8208;doped 1D chain Ln&#8208;CPs of [Y2&#8208;2xYb2x(FCA)6]n (x&#160;=&#160;0.2, 2) x&#160;=&#160;0.5, 3) x&#160;=&#160;0.7, 4) x&#160;=&#160;0.9, 5) x&#160;=&#160;1, 6) are prepared. Investigation of the UCL of FCA in these CPs reveals that Ln3&#8314;&#8208;induced ligand UCL are achieved for the first time. Notably, 4 not only displays bright UCL under both 10 and 15&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 excitation power of 980&#160;nm laser but also achieves an absolute UCQY of 0.003&#160;%, opening new avenues for the development of Ln&#8208;CPs as UCL materials.

         <title>Against the Wallach's Rule Through Rational Design of Metal&#8208;Free Chiral Perovskites Toward Efficient Red Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes the cyclohexanediammonium cations to construct the chiral metal&#8208;free perovskites, thereby challenging the Wallach's rule. Highly efficient near&#8208;infrared/red circularly polarized phosphorescence is achieved by strategically weakening the interactions between adjacent chiral cations. The obtained chiral metal&#8208;free perovskite demonstrates an exceptional photoluminescence quantum yield of 71.22% together with |glum| of 9.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3.








Abstract
The potential applications of circularly polarized phosphorescent materials in chiroptical devices have attracted considerable interest. Nevertheless, the design of efficient near&#8208;infrared/red circularly polarized phosphorescent pure organic materials remains a significant challenge, largely due to the limitations imposed by the energy&#8208;gap law and Wallach's rule. In this study, the chiral metal&#8208;free perovskite strategy is employed to overcome these restrictions. The introduction of cyclohexylenediammonium cations as the A&#8208;site of chiral metal&#8208;free perovskites results in the generation of an efficient near&#8208;infrared/red phosphorescence at 637&#160;nm with a lifetime of up to 227.98 &#181;s. Furthermore, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) can reach up to 71.22%, accompanied by an anisotropy factor of 9.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. The figure of merit (FM&#160;=&#160;PLQY&#215; |glum|) is 6.98&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, which is the highest value achieved among all the pure organic circularly polarized phosphorescent materials. The work proposes a unique strategy to achieve highly efficient near&#8208;infrared/red circularly polarized phosphorescence based on non&#8208;conjugated luminophores, which is accomplished by combining the superior optical and electronic properties of metal&#8208;free perovskites with chirality based on the rational molecular design.

         <title>Simultaneous Electrochemical Upgrading of Biomass and CO2 Utilization Using Fe/Ni&#8208;Derived Carbon Nanotubes Derived from CO2</title>

         <dc:description>
Recently, fossil fuel consumption has led to petroleum shortages and high carbon emissions. Thus, this study explores renewable resources for the electrochemical synthesis of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and carbon monoxide (CO), from hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and carbon dioxide (CO2), respectively, using Fe/Ni&#8208;supported carbon nanotubes (CNTs) catalysts derived from CO2, achieving a faradaic efficiency of FDCA as 99.60% and 96.25% for CO.








Abstract
Fossil fuel consumption has caused petroleum shortages and increased carbon emissions; thus, utilizing renewable resources in biorefineries for biomass&#8208;derived chemical synthesis is promising. Among them, 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is a key alternative to terephthalic acid (PTA) for sustainable polyester production. In this work, we demonstrate an efficient approach for the simultaneous production of FDCA while utilizing carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) via an electrochemical approach. Complete electrooxidation of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) at the anode yields FDCA, while CO&#8322; reduction at the cathode produces valuable compounds such as carbon monoxide (CO). This concurrent HMF electrooxidation and CO&#8322; electroreduction strategy enables high&#8208;value chemical production at mild conditions. In addition, we developed efficient single catalysts, FeNi metals supported on CO&#8322;&#8208;derived multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes deposited on nickel foam (FeNiCNTs/NF) as both the anode and the cathode for HMF oxidation and CO2 reduction, respectively. Remarkably, faradaic efficiencies reached 99.60% for FDCA (FEFDCA) at the anode and 96.25% for CO (FECO) at the cathode. This study highlights the effective use of synthesized non&#8208;noble metals supported on CO&#8322;&#8208;derived CNTs for integrated biorefinery and CO&#8322; utilization.

         <title>Disentangling Radiative and Non&#8208;Radiative Deactivation Pathways in CuI &#8208;Based TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The temperature dependence of individual non&#8208;radiative decay rates of the lowest singlet and triplet states has been determined in a series of Cu(I) thermally activated delayed fluorescence compounds. Such temperature dependence is usually neglected, which is shown here to lead to significant errors in the determination of the singlet&#8208;triplet splittings.








Abstract
The analysis of thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters traditionally neglects the temperature dependence of the non&#8208;radiative singlet and triplet decay rates, which, for systems with quantum yields significantly departing from unity, unavoidably leads to inaccurate determination of the relevant photophysical parameters. Here we address this issue by performing a detailed photophysical study in three solid&#8208;state CuI complexes with the general formula [Cu(dmp)(PPh3)X] (X = Cl, Br, I). Decomposition of the measured temperature&#8208;dependent lifetimes &#964;(T) into their radiative and non&#8208;radiative contributions demonstrates a significant temperature dependence of the non&#8208;radiative rates, which leads to large deviations of the singlet&#8208;triplet gaps &#916;EST from those determined in the traditional way. Our detailed analysis further confirms that non&#8208;radiative parameters follow the energy gap law and that zero field splitting effects, which are unrecognizable in the bare &#964;(T) data, are governed by the heavy atom effect. Our analysis is supported by measurements of the decay of the prompt fluorescence which is dominated by kISC in the studied compounds.

         <title>Electronic Localization Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Sulfides&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an electron localization strategy to effectively suppresses the interfacial side reactions by modulating the d&#8211;p orbital hybridization within PS4 tetrahedron of Li6PS5Cl through atom&#8208;scale dual&#8208;substitution of yttrium and oxygen. This approach greatly enhances the interfacial stability and enables an ultrahigh cycling performance of 100% capacity retention after 1300 cycles at 0.5 C.








Abstract
Argyrodite&#8208;based sulfide electrolytes have received considerable attention in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries owing to their high ionic conductivity and good mechanical property. However, the reactivity between sulfide electrolytes and lithium anode leads to continuous interfacial reactions and dendrites growth, which severely hinders their practical applications. We propose an electron localization strategy by modulating the d&#8211;p orbital hybridization within the PS4 tetrahedral structure of Li6PS5Cl through homogeneous incorporation of yttrium (Y) and oxygen (O). The introduction of Y strengthens the Madelung energy with sulfur (S) atom and induces the electronic localization of S atom, which suppresses the interaction between lithium metal and S atom of the tetrahedron. The air&#8208;stability is also enhanced due to oxygen introduction. Furthermore, the in situ formation of Li2O interphase acts as a protective barrier, synergistically mitigating the interfacial reactions between lithium metal and Li6PS5Cl. The Li symmetric cell with the modulated Li6PS5Cl electrolyte achieves stable lithium plating/stripping for over 4800&#160;h. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with LiCoO2/Li&#8208;In electrode display a remarkable long cycle performance with 100% retention after 1300 cycles at 0.5 C. This study presents a distinct strategy that employs the electron localization driven by modulating orbital hybridization to achieve ultrastable interface in sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Development of Chemically Tailored Peptide Binders of RNF43/ZNRF3 to Enable Versatile Design of Membrane Protein&#8208;Targeting PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically tailored peptide binders of RNF43/ZNRF3 developed by a structure&#8208;guided design strategy are used to establish a novel E3 ligase&#8208;mediated modular platform for membrane protein degradation. This innovative system enables robust generation of synthetic bispecific chimeras featuring enhanced structural diversity and smaller size. The platform demonstrates broad applicability in degrading diverse membrane&#8208;bound therapeutic targets, including programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).








Abstract
Targeted membrane protein degradation using cell surface E3 ligases RNF43/ZNRF3 via proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represents an effective strategy for treating membrane drug targets that cannot be fully inhibited using traditional inhibitors. Several ingenious chimeras have been developed to tether RNF43/ZNRF3 to target membrane proteins, resulting in the degradation of targets at sub&#8208;nanomolar concentrations both in vitro and in vivo. However, currently available RNF43/ZNRF3 binders are genetically encoded and have poor plasticity, which limits the design and promotion of such PROTACs. Here, we exploited the AlphaFold&#8208;predicted complex structures of ligand&#8208;bound RNF43/ZNRF3 and developed a class of chemically tailored peptide binders for ZNRF3/RNF43. With these peptide binders that can be conveniently prepared by de novo peptide synthesis, we established a new membrane protein degradation platform that allows versatile modular design and targeted degradation of clinically relevant membrane proteins, i.e., PD&#8208;L1 and EGFR. This study presents a new subtype within the PROTAC field to develop therapeutic peptides targeting membrane proteins.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Meta C&#9472;H Alkoxylation and Amidation via Polarity Reversal of Nucleophilic Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the first example of the use of a nucleophilic reagent, such as an alcohol or amide, to replace the electrophilic reagent during the palladium&#8208;catalyzed meta C&#9472;H alkoxylation or amidation reaction of an arene. The reaction conditions are mild and highly site&#8208;selective, thereby facilitating the direct introduction of natural products or drug molecules containing hydroxyl or amido groups at the meta positions of arenes. In addition, the directing group is rapidly convertible into the corresponding aldehyde, which further enhances the applicability of the reaction. 








Abstract
Norbornene&#8208;mediated remote metaselective C&#9472;H functionalization of arenes have been limited to relatively weakly electronegative and &#8220;soft&#8221; species, such as aryl, alkyl, and alkylamino moieties. Herein, we describe the first example of the use of a nucleophilic reagent, such as an alcohol or amide, to replace the electrophilic reagent during the palladium&#8208;catalyzed meta C&#9472;H alkoxylation or amidation reaction of an arene. The reaction conditions are mild and highly site&#8208;selective, thereby facilitating the direct introduction of natural products or drug molecules containing hydroxyl or amido groups at the meta positions of arenes. In addition, the directing group is rapidly convertible into the corresponding aldehyde, which further enhances the applicability of the reaction. Control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that alcohol and amide polarity reversal induced by hypervalent iodine reagents and the subsequent formation of a Pd(IV) intermediate via the oxidative addition of the aryl&#8211;norbornyl&#8211;palladacycle intermediate are crucial for promoting the entire catalytic reaction cycle.

         <title>Elucidating the Boundary of Intercalation vs Sequestration in Supramolecular Polymers by Retrosynthetic Design Toward the Construction of Complex Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

By retrosynthetically analyzing the molecular structure of an intercalator, clear design principles toward supramolecular sequestration can be obtained. Investigating a model supramolecular polymer in the presence of these additives offers a general approach toward dilution&#8208;induced polymerization and complex hybrid systems of dual sequestration and hybrid mechanisms of sequestration and intercalation.








Abstract
Controlled social self&#8208;sorting by intercalation can offer distinct properties at the supramolecular level that go beyond the sum of its parts. Likewise, controlling narcissistic self&#8208;sorting by sequestration can induce unique system properties. In contrast, the interface between the two cases has hitherto remained underexplored, and clear design rules remain elusive. Herein it is demonstrated that by fine&#8208;tuning the molecular similarity of supramolecular synthons, intricate control over concerted supramolecular equilibria can be achieved. By reducing the molecular similarity, a former intercalator can be tuned to become a strong or weak sequestrator. Understanding these roles in binary mixtures allows to rationalize more complex tertiary systems. Consequently, the influence of an uncommon dual sequestration mechanism is revealed. Further, an unprecedented hybrid mechanism between supramolecular intercalation and sequestration can be demonstrated. We are hopeful that the results presented herein will contribute to the development and understanding of concerted processes in complex supramolecular systems.

         <title>Robust p&#8208;d Orbital Coupling in PtCoIn@Pt Core&#8211;Shell Catalysts for Durable Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of the p&#8208;block element indium into PtCo results in a ternary L10&#8208;PtCoIn@Pt core&#8211;shell catalyst. This integration promotes p&#8208;d orbital coupling, enhancing the ORR activity and durability. Impressively, even after 60&#8201;000 square wave potential cycles, this catalyst preserved its initial mass activity, showing no degradation in an H2&#8208;O2 fuel cell.








Abstract
Pt&#8208;based catalysts are playing increasingly important roles in fuel cells owing to their high catalytic activity. However, harsh electrocatalytic conditions often trigger atomic migration and dissolution in these catalysts, causing rapid performance deterioration. Here, a novel L10&#8208;PtCoIn@Pt core&#8211;shell catalyst is introduced, where indium (In) is incorporated into a PtCo matrix. This integration promotes p&#8211;d orbital coupling, optimizing the electronic structure of Pt and causing additional lattice strain within PtCo. Impressively, L10&#8208;PtCoIn@Pt exhibits remarkable activity and durability, with only a 5.1% reduction in mass activity (MA) after 120&#8201;000 potential cycles. In H2&#8208;O2 fuel cells, this cathode achieves a peak power density of 1.99&#160;W cm&#8722;2 and maintains a high MA of 0.73 A mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#160;V. After enduring 60&#8201;000 square wave potential cycles, the catalyst maintains its initial MA and sustains the cell voltage at 0.8 A cm&#8722;2, exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 2025 targets. Theoretical studies highlight the enhancements originating from the modulated electronic structures and shifted d&#8208;band center of Pt induced by In doping and increased vacancy formation energies in Pt and Co atoms, affirming the catalyst's superior durability.

         <title>Fully Conjugated Benzobisoxazole&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two high&#8208;quality, benzobisoxazole&#8208;bridged, fully conjugated covalent organic frameworks were constructed for the first time. COF&#8208;JLU45 displayed an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of 272.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with superior reusability via water splitting under visible&#8208;light irradiation.








Abstract
2D covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have attracted extensive interest in solar energy to hydrogen conversion. However, insufficient light harvesting and difficult exciton dissociation severely limit the improvement of photocatalytic activity for COFs, thereby impeding the progression of this advanced field. In this work, two benzobisoxazole&#8208;bridged and fully conjugated 2D&#8208;COFs with triazine (COF&#8208;JLU44) and pyrene (COF&#8208;JLU45) units were constructed for the first time via Knoevenagel polycondensation, and they hold long&#8208;range ordered structures, largely acceptable surface area, and fascinating photoelectric properties. Significantly, COF&#8208;JLU45 exhibits an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of 272.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and superior reusability in the presence of 1.0 wt% Pt under light irradiation, coupled with a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 12.9% at a long wavelength of 600&#160;nm. Multiple spectroscopy and theoretical simulation demonstrate the ingenious design of COF&#8208;JLU45 widen its light absorption and effectively promote the exciton dissociation. This finding contributes valuable insights for constructing metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and utilization.

         <title>Biphenylene Coordination and Ring&#8208;Opening by Alkali&#8208;Metal Nickelates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of aryl&#8208;alkali&#8208;metal (Li, Na, and K) nickelates that coordinate biphenylene in a &#951;4&#8208;motif have been prepared and structurally characterized. These low&#8208;valent heterobimetallic complexes undergo ring&#8208;opening and oxidative addition of the central C&#9472;C bond of biphenylene, which is highly dependent on the identity of the alkali&#8208;metal and carbanionic scaffold.








Abstract
The pre&#8208;coordination of substrates to heterobimetallic complexes plays a key role in facilitating challenging bond activations and catalytic reactions. Herein, we report a family of low&#8208;valent phenyl&#8208;alkali&#8208;metal nickelates containing a &#951;4&#8208;coordinated biphenylene ligand and demonstrate how the coordination and solvation preferences of the alkali&#8208;metal cation (Li, Na, or K) influence the rate of C&#9472;C bond oxidative addition at nickel through combined structural, spectroscopic and computational studies. The rate of C&#9472;C bond cleavage can be further manipulated by replacing the two phenyl&#8208;carbanionic ligands with a cyclic 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl scaffold, which affords thermally stable and symmetric spirocyclic nickelates upon ring&#8208;opening.

         <title>Single&#8208;Grain High&#8208;Efficiency Full&#8208;Visible&#8208;Spectrum White Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SrLiPO4/Sr9MgLi(PO4)7:Eu2+ single&#8208;grain phosphors prepared in this work have achieved remarkable full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum emission efficiency, with record internal and external quantum efficiencies of 76.1% and 56.2%, respectively. The high luminescence efficiency stems from the constructed heterojunction interface, which blocks the detrimental energy&#8208;migration process.








Abstract
Full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum emission phosphors are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs), overcoming the complex and high costs of traditional mixed phosphors. However, their practical application is hindered by low luminescence efficiency. In this regard, a generalization strategy is developed that involves creating heterostructure interfaces to prevent detrimental energy transfer processes, thereby boosting efficiency. The SrLiPO4/Sr9MgLi(PO4)7:Eu2+ single&#8208;grain phosphors prepared in this work have achieved remarkable full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum emission efficiency, with record internal and external quantum efficiencies of 76.1% and 56.2%, respectively. The WLEDs encapsulated with this phosphor feature a high color rendering index (&#8776;93.9), a low correlated color temperature (&#8776;3100&#160;K), and stable color performance, indicating that the as&#8208;synthesized single&#8208;grain phosphors are excellent candidates for healthy full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum lighting. This innovation is expected to accelerate the development of full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum phosphors technology and inspires the creation of more efficient and versatile luminescent materials in the future.

The SrLiPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Sr&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;MgLi(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; single-grain phosphors prepared in this work have achieved remarkable full-visible-spectrum emission efficiency, with record internal and external quantum efficiencies of 76.1% and 56.2%, respectively. The WLEDs encapsulated with this phosphor feature a high color rendering index (&#8776;93.9), a low correlated color temperature (&#8776;3100&#160;K), and stable color performance, indicating that the as-synthesized single-grain phosphors are excellent candidates for healthy full-visible-spectrum lighting. This innovation is expected to accelerate the development of full-visible-spectrum phosphors technology and inspires the creation of more efficient and versatile luminescent materials in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Homochiral Helical Poly(thiophene)s Accessed via Living Catalyst&#8208;Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of helical conjugated poly(thiophene)s via living catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization. The polymers have narrow dispersities (&#272;&#160;&lt;&#160;1.10), can be accessed with controlled molecular weights (n&#160;=&#160;10&#8211;100), and are stable in acids, bases, and strong nucleophiles. We envision these polymers will be useful in biomimetic and organic electronic applications due to the degree of control over the polymer structure and stability.








Abstract
Synthetic helical polymers form compact, ordered, and inherently chiral structures, enabling their uses in biomimetic applications as well as catalysis. A challenge in using synthetic helical polymers, however, is their tendency to be sensitive to pH and the presence of nucleophiles, Lewis&#8208;acids, or metal ions. We report a strategy to overcome these shortcomings by adapting catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization, a living chain&#8208;growth polymerization typically used to access linear conjugated polymers, for the synthesis of helical poly(thiophene)s. We demonstrate that the helical poly(thiophene)s can be synthesized with a single helicity, incorporated into block copolymers, and functionalized at the chain&#8208;ends, enabling further conjugation and functionalization. The helical poly(thiophene)s are stable to a variety of conditions, providing benefits over other helical polymers which contain sensitive imine or carbonyl&#8208;based functional groups. We anticipate that the ability to access homochiral, heterotelechelic helical conjugated polymers and copolymers will enable new uses of these materials in optoelectronics as well as in applications for mimicking biomacromolecules and other polymers with precisely defined sequences.

         <title>Electrochemical Pilot H2O2 Production by Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Reactor: Insights From a Hybrid Catalyst for 2&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We combined transition metal hydroxides (NiFeW LDH, NiFe LDH, Ni(OH)&#8322;) with OCNTs electrocatalysts, carefully designed water dissociation active centers, and employed an innovative membrane&#8208;free microchannel CER electrolyte configuration to generate pure H&#8322;O&#8322; in a pilot electrolyzer, achieving an industrial&#8208;relevant current of 15 A and 127.0&#160;mmol h&#8722;1.








Abstract
The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers an alluring and sustainable alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process for hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;) synthesis. However, challenges remain in developing scalable electrocatalysts and cost&#8208;effective reactors for high&#8208;purity H&#8322;O&#8322; production. This study introduces a simple yet effective mechanical mixing method to fabricate a hybrid electrocatalyst from oxidized carbon nanotubes and layered double hydroxides (LDHs). This easily accessible and low&#8208;cost catalyst achieves near&#8208;perfect Faradaic efficiency (&#8764;100%) with low overpotentials of 73&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 and 588&#160;mV at 400&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 in a solid electrolyte cell. Through theoretical calculations and in&#8208;situ analyses, we uncover the pivotal role played by the LDH co&#8208;catalyst in fine&#8208;tuning the local pH at the catalyst/solid&#8208;electrolyte interface that drives both the activity and selectivity. We also design a low&#8208;cost solid&#8208;state reactor using cation&#8208;exchange resin (CER) as both a proton conductor and a microchannel for efficient mass transfer, achieving a production rate of 5.29&#160;mmol cm&#8315;2 h&#8315;&#185; and continuous output concentrations of 11.8&#160;wt.% H&#8322;O&#8322;. Scaled to an industrial area of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;100 cm2, the pilot reactor achieves an impressive H&#8322;O&#8322; production rate of approximately 127.0&#160;mmol h&#8315;&#185; at 15 A, marking a significant advancement in sustainable H&#8322;O&#8322; production.

         <title>Synergistic Catalysts for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries: Ni Single Atom and MoC Nanoclusters Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel dual&#8208;site catalyst Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC demonstrates distinct catalytic functions, where the MoC sites exhibit high efficacy in catalyzing the reduction of long&#8208;chain LiPSs from Li2S8 to Li2S4. Concurrently, the Ni&#8208;N4 sites facilitate the reduction of short&#8208;chain LiPSs from Li2S4 to Li2S. This dual functionality synergistically enhances the overall Li&#8208;S redox process while mitigating the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites.








Abstract
The practical application of sulfur (S) cathodes in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries is hindered by the shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics. Addressing these challenges requires advanced catalytic host materials capable of trapping LiPSs and accelerating Li&#8208;S redox reactions. However, single&#8208;site catalysts struggle to effectively mediate the complex multi&#8208;step and multi&#8208;phase sulfur conversion processes. In this study, we present a novel dual&#8208;site catalyst, Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC, featuring nickel single atoms anchored to nitrogen sites (Ni&#8208;N4) within a carbon nitride (NC) matrix and molybdenum carbide (MoC) nanoclusters. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that MoC sites efficiently catalyze the reduction of long&#8208;chain LiPSs (Li&#8322;S&#8328; to Li&#8322;S&#8324;), while Ni&#8208;N4 sites drive the reduction of short&#8208;chain LiPSs (Li&#8322;S&#8324; to Li&#8322;S), resulting in a synergistic enhancement of the complete Li&#8208;S redox process. When incorporated as a coating on the cathode side of a commercial polypropylene (PP) separator, the Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC catalyst enhances sulfur utilization, suppresses LiPSs shuttling, and facilitates a uniform Li+&#8208;ion distribution, effectively mitigating the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites. Thereby, Li&#8208;S batteries employing an S/Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC cathode and a Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC@PP separator demonstrate outstanding performance, including an initial capacity of 1624&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at 0.2C and 1142&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at 1C, retaining 590&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; after 800 cycles. At a sulfur loading of 8.3&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8315;2 and an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6&#160;&#181;L mg&#8315;&#185;, the system achieves an initial areal capacity of 9.57&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8315;2 at 0.1C, showcasing significant promise for practical applications.

         <title>A Triphenylamine&#8208;Functionalized Co&#8208;Assembly Material for Record Efficiency Inverted CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
The precise regulation of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) distribution and interfacial modification is pivotal for advancing the performance of p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a new co&#8208;assembly material, 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;diphenylaniline iodide (TPAI), is developed to make SAM orderly assembled. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation and sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy reveal that TPAI binds with SAM via &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, effectively suppressing SAM aggregation and enhancing the orderliness of self&#8208;assembly.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise regulation of self-assembled monolayer (SAM) distribution and interfacial modification is pivotal for advancing the performance of p-i-n inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a new co-assembly material, 4-(aminomethyl)-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-diphenylaniline iodide (TPAI), is developed to make SAM orderly assembled. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation and sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy reveal that TPAI binds with SAM via &lt;i&gt;&#960;-&#960;&lt;/i&gt; interactions, effectively suppressing SAM aggregation and enhancing the orderliness of self-assembly. Further characterization by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrates that &#9472;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group in TPAI coordinates with undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to passivate defects of cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) film. The TPAI modification creates a defect-minimized buried interface with optimized energy alignment, significantly improving hole extraction and transport kinetics. Consequently, the TPAI-treated CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PSCs achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.60%, the highest reported value for inverted CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PSCs, maintaining 96.71% initial PCE after tracking at maximum power point (MPP) for 1400&#160;h.

         <title>Anomalous Magnetic Hysteresis up to 20&#160;K in a Non&#8208;Kramers Light&#8208;Lanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first praseodymium (Pr) single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) is designed and synthesized by confining single non&#8208;Kramers light&#8208;lanthanide Pr(III) inside an azafullerene cage, which shows an anomalously high&#8208;temperature magnetic bistability up to 20&#160;K, the highest value among all reported light&#8208;lanthanide SMMs, without employing a demanding strong axial ligand field.








Abstract
Light&#8208;lanthanides (Ln), despite their widespread uses in commercial permanent magnets, are among the least explored metal elements as building blocks of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) due to their smaller magnetic moments as well as weaker spin&#8211;orbit couplings than those of the heavy&#8208;Ln counterparts, and so far, only a neodymium (Nd) complex has been reported showing a small magnetic hysteresis at 2&#160;K. Here, we report a low&#8208;coordination praseodymium (Pr) complex, namely, Pr@C81N, featuring a non&#8208;Kramers trivalent Pr ion entrapped within an azafullerene cage and behaving as the first Pr&#8208;based SMM. Although the weak nonaxial ligand field imposed only by the carbon cage on the integer&#8208;spin Pr(III) elicits nondegenerate spin states, Pr@C81N shows an anomalous magnetic hysteresis up to 20&#160;K using a field sweep rate of 20&#160;Oe/s, which is the highest temperature among all reported light&#8208;Ln SMMs. In addition to the ideally minimized spin&#8211;phonon coupling in the low coordination, the origin of such an unexpected magnetic bistability for the non&#8208;Kramers complex likely lies in nuclear sublevels arising from a large Pr hyperfine coupling, which feature distinct electronic magnetizations within the highly mixed ground electronic state.

         <title>Concentrated Chloride Electrolytes Enable High&#8208;Efficiency, Long&#8208;Cycling, and Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Trivalent Antimony Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a concentrated chloride electrolyte to address the Sb3+ hydrolysis issue and achieved highly reversible three&#8208;electron Sb plating chemistry, leading to high efficiency (99.7%&#8211;99.8%), long life (10 months), and dendrite&#8208;free spherical morphology.








Abstract
Aqueous trivalent metal batteries are promising energy storage systems, which can leverage unique three&#8208;electron redox reactions to deliver high capacity and high energy. Among them, antimony (Sb) stands out with a high capacity (660 mAh g&#8722;1), abundant availability, and low cost. However, the severe Sb3+ hydrolysis reaction drastically hinders the development of aqueous antimony batteries. Herein, we address this issue by employing a concentrated lithium chloride electrolyte, which stabilizes reactive Sb3+ ions via forming robust antimony&#8208;chloride complexes. This approach effectively mitigates hydrolysis and achieves highly reversible Sb plating behavior, leading to high efficiency (99.7%&#8211;99.8%), long lifespan (7300 h, 10 months), and uniform spherical deposition morphology. When paired with a manganese dioxide (MnO2) cathode, the Sb&#8214;MnO2 battery demonstrates a high capacity of 309 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability of 50&#160;000 cycles (&#8764;70% retention). Additionally, Sb shows promise as a high&#8208;capacity cathode, which can integrate with low&#8208;potential zinc into novel dual&#8208;metal plating batteries with long cycling life (4,000 h). This work not only deepens our fundamental understanding of trivalent Sb3+ redox chemistry but also opens new opportunities to stabilize hydrolysable and high&#8208;charge&#8208;density cations for multivalent battery applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Pillar[5]Arenes Through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Azide&#8211;Alkyne Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel strategy is presented for synthesizing inherently chiral pillar[5]arenes through an iterative CuAAC reaction. By increasing the steric hindrance on both sides of the macrocyclic molecule, a wide range of pillar[5]arenes are efficiently prepared in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities.








Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes have been extensively investigated as carrier materials for applications in host&#8208;guest chemistry, nanoscience, information science, materials science, and other domains. Despite its success, the enantioselective synthesis of pillar[n]arenes is challenging and has not yet been achieved. Herein, a novel asymmetric extended side&#8208;arm strategy is presented for synthesizing chiral pillar[5]arenes through an iterative copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction. An increase in the steric hindrance on both sides of the macrocyclic molecule efficiently produced a wide range of pillar[5]arenes in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Moreover, this principle enables iterative copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition to enantioselectively functionalized pillar[5]arenes with different triazoles using a one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Engineering Asymmetric Electronic Structure of Co&#9472;N&#9472;C Single&#8208;Atomic Sites Toward Excellent Electrochemical H2O2 Production and Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co&#9472;N5 site with asymmetric electronic structure was built to improve the activation of O2, moderate the adsorption of *OOH intermediate, and ideally conserve the generated H2O2, achieving the excellent H2O2 selectivity by 92.5%. The 2e&#8722; ORR coupled oxidation further realized the efficient cellulosic biomass upgrading into valued formic acid with a high yield of 92.1%.








Abstract
To advance electrochemical H2O2 production and unravel catalytic mechanisms, the precise structural coordination of single&#8208;atomic M&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalysts is urgently required. Herein, the Co&#9472;N5 site with an asymmetric electronic configuration is constructed to boost the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) compared to symmetric Co&#9472;N4, effectively overcoming the trade&#8208;off between activity and selectivity in H2O2 production. Both experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that breaking the symmetry of Co&#9472;N sites promotes the activation of O2 molecules and moderates the adsorption of the key *OOH intermediate by disrupting the linear scaling relationship for intermediates&#160;adsorption. This modulation enables efficient H&#8322;O&#8322; production and its effective retention for subsequent applications. As a proof of concept, Co&#9472;N5 achieves a H2O2 production rate as high as 16.1&#160;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in a flow cell, outperforming most recently reported counterparts. Furthermore, the coupling of 2e&#8722; ORR with the oxidation of cellulose&#8208;derived carbohydrates accomplishes high formic acid yields (84.1% from glucose and 62.0%&#8211;92.1% from other substrates), underpinning the sustainable electro&#8208;refinery for biomass valorization at ambient conditions. By elucidating the intrinsic relationship between 2e&#8315; ORR and the asymmetry of single&#8208;atomic sites, this work paves the way for high&#8208;performance electrosynthesis.

&lt;p&gt;To advance electrochemical H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production and unravel catalytic mechanisms, the precise structural coordination of single-atomic M-N-C electrocatalysts is urgently required. Herein, the Co&#9472;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; site with an asymmetric electronic configuration is constructed to boost the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR) compared to symmetric Co&#9472;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, effectively overcoming the trade-off between activity and selectivity in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. Both experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that breaking the symmetry of Co&#9472;N sites promotes the activation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules and moderates the adsorption of the key *OOH intermediate by disrupting the linear scaling relationship for intermediates&#160;adsorption. This modulation enables efficient H&#8322;O&#8322; production and its effective retention for subsequent applications. As a proof of concept, Co&#9472;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; achieves a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate as high as 16.1&#160;mol&#160;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in a flow cell, outperforming most recently reported counterparts. Furthermore, the coupling of 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR with the oxidation of cellulose-derived carbohydrates accomplishes high formic acid yields (84.1% from glucose and 62.0%&#8211;92.1% from other substrates), underpinning the sustainable electro-refinery for biomass valorization at ambient conditions. By elucidating the intrinsic relationship between 2e&#8315; ORR and the asymmetry of single-atomic sites, this work paves the way for high-performance electrosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Retarding Phase Segregation via Lattice Reinforcement for Efficient and Stable Perovskite/Organic Tandems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically stable perovskite lattice was achieved by incorporating DMA+, which suppresses the halide phase segregation under both high&#8208;power illumination and high&#8208;bias voltage. The resultant perovskite/organic tandem solar cells with active areas of 0.062 and 1.004 cm2 achieved remarkable PCEs of 26.15% (certified: 25.34%) and 24.87%, respectively, and showed excellent long&#8208;term operational stability with T90 of &#8764;1350&#160;h.








Abstract
The operational perovskite/organic tandems are subjected to light irradiation and driven by a higher bias voltage than single&#8208;junction solar cells, posing a severe challenge to their stabilities. Light irradiation can trigger halide phase segregation in the perovskite subcell, exacerbated under higher bias voltage through electron&#8211;phonon coupling. To address this, dimethylammonium ion (DMA+) incorporation delays perovskite crystallization by forming an intermediate phase, enhancing crystallinity, and reducing lattice structural defects. DMA+ with a larger ionic radius entering the A&#8208;site of lattice tilts the [PbX6]4&#8722; (X: I or Br) octahedral, enlarging the perovskite bandgap, shortening Pb&#9472;I bonds, and reinforcing the lattice. This mitigates halide escaping from the lattice and subsequent ion migration. Phase segregation in the perovskite subcell is significantly suppressed under high&#8208;power irradiation and bias voltage. Consequently, the perovskite subcell exhibits increased and stable quasi&#8208;Fermi&#8208;level splitting values, delivering a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.34&#160;V. Notably, 0.062&#8208;cm2 and 1.004&#8208;cm2 perovskite/organic tandems achieved remarkable efficiencies of 26.15% (certified of 25.34%) and 24.87%, respectively, exhibiting excellent operational stability of T90 &#8764; 1350&#160;h.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated CO2 Electrolysis for Recovering Transmembrane Carbon Loss</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox mediator (RM)&#8208;coupled electrolysis strategy was proposed to address the transmembrane CO2 loss issue in alkaline CO2 electrolysis. By utilizing anthraquinone&#8208;2,7&#8208;disulfonic acid (AQDS) as the redox mediator, the system could operate continuously at 100&#160;mA/cm2, achieving a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion while simultaneously enabling efficient recovery of transmembrane CO2 gas.








Abstract
CO2 electrolysis in alkaline media presents advantages by suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and enhancing the CO2 reduction selectivity. However, it suffers from the carbonation issue, leading to substantial carbon loss due to CO2 transmembrane transport. To tackle this issue, we here put forward a redox mediator (RM)&#8208;coupled electrolysis strategy. By integrating a highly reversible redox couple, this approach spatially separates the cathodic CO2 reduction and the anodic oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) into two electrolyzers, thereby enabling the recovery and reuse of transmembrane CO2. Anthraquinone&#8208;2,7&#8208;disulfonic acid (AQDS) was chosen as the redox mediator owing to its suitable redox potential, excellent electrochemical reversibility, high solubility, and nontransmembrane shuttling characteristics. It allowed the RM&#8208;coupled electrolysis system to operate continuously at 100&#160;mA/cm2, maintaining a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion consistently around 90%, while effectively capturing the transmembrane CO2.&#160;This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration validates the feasibility of RM&#8208;coupled electrolysis and highlights its significant potential to advance the practical application of CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Improving Circularity via Chemical Recycling to all Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The initial monomer free energy of polymerization (&#8710;GROP) is traditionally regarded as the benchmark for the polymer's chemical recyclability. But if we instead consider every ring size present at equilibrium (&#8710;GRCE), a different viewpoint emerges. We found that polymers previously regarded as unsuitable for chemical recycling are highly chemically recyclable at low temperatures under the right concentration and catalytic conditions.








Abstract
Aliphatic polyesters synthesized via ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) have properties competitive to incumbent plastic (PE, PP), while simultaneously opening up for chemical recycling to monomer (CRM). However, not all aliphatic polyesters are prone to undergo CRM, and the ability to shift the equilibrium between polymer and monomer is tightly associated with the initial monomer structure. The standard strategy to measure CRM is to evaluate the change in free energy during polymerization (&#8710;GROP). However, &#8710;GROP is only one&#8208;dimensional by assessing the equilibrium between initial monomer and polymer. But under active catalytic conditions, the depolymerization of polymers can lead to formation of larger rings, such as dimers, trimers, tetramers, and so on, via the ring&#8208;chain equilibrium (RCE), meaning that the real thermodynamic recycling landscape is multi&#8208;dimensional. This work introduces a multi&#8208;dimensional chemical recycling to all rings (CRR) via a highly active catalytic system to reach RCE. Thermodynamically &#8710;GRCE is completely different from &#8710;GROP. Using &#8710;GRCE instead of &#8710;GROP allows us to achieve CRR for polymers notoriously difficult to achieve CRM for, as exemplified within by CRR for poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone), poly(pentadecalactone), and mixed polymer systems. Overall, this work provides a new general concept of closing the material loop.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Free Ethylene Dimerization Over Well&#8208;Defined Nickel&#8208;Zeolite Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>A simple two&#8208;step ion&#8208;exchange strategy for the preparation of Ni&#8208;Mg&#8208;Y zeolite containing well&#8208;defined coordinatively&#8208;unsaturated nickel centers as a promising catalyst for ethylene dimerization, which also offers valuable insights into bridging heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Ethylene dimerization is a crucial chemical process, which currently relies on organo&#8208;metallic catalysis with the assistance of overdosed additives as cocatalysts. Heterogeneous nickel catalysts have been investigated as alternatives for ethylene dimerization, however suffer from low catalytic activity and/or poor 1&#8208;butene selectivity. Herein, we report a simple two&#8208;step ion&#8208;exchange strategy for the preparation of Ni&#8208;Mg&#8208;Y zeolite containing well&#8208;defined coordinatively&#8208;unsaturated nickel centers as a promising catalyst for ethylene dimerization. Ni&#8208;Mg&#8208;Y shows unprecedent performance with 1&#8208;butene formation rate of 3.8 &#215; 105&#160;h&#8722;1 and 1&#8208;butene selectivity of 91.2&#160;%, without the assistance of any cocatalysts. With the combination of advanced characterization techniques and comprehensive theoretical simulations, it has been demonstrated for the first time that the in&#8208;situ generated Ni&#8208;alkyl motif is the intrinsic active site and ethylene dimerization proceeds dominantly via the Cossee&#8208;Arlman pathway. The dynamic hydrogen transfer between ethylene/alkyl ligand and zeolite framework dedicates to the observed catalytic performance.

&lt;p&gt;Ethylene dimerization is a crucial chemical process, which currently relies on organo-metallic catalysis with the assistance of overdosed additives as cocatalysts. Heterogeneous nickel catalysts have been investigated as alternatives for ethylene dimerization, however suffer from low catalytic activity and/or poor 1-butene selectivity. Herein, we report a simple two-step ion-exchange strategy for the preparation of Ni-Mg-Y zeolite containing well-defined coordinatively-unsaturated nickel centers as a promising catalyst for ethylene dimerization. Ni-Mg-Y shows unprecedent performance with 1-butene formation rate of 3.8 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1-butene selectivity of 91.2&#160;%, without the assistance of any cocatalysts. With the combination of advanced characterization techniques and comprehensive theoretical simulations, it has been demonstrated for the first time that the in-situ generated Ni-alkyl motif is the intrinsic active site and ethylene dimerization proceeds dominantly via the Cossee-Arlman pathway. The dynamic hydrogen transfer between ethylene/alkyl ligand and zeolite framework dedicates to the observed catalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gem&#8208;Diboronic Acids: A Motif for Anion Recognition in Competitive Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gem&#8208;diboronic acids are an anion recognition motif that provides strong and directional binding to oxoanions in aqueous media. This motif provides a selectivity profile that is distinct from other anion recognition groups, and binding affinities that are superior to those of simple amides and (thio)ureas. A simple receptor featuring two gem&#8208;diboronic acid motifs was found to be one of the most selective malonate receptors disclosed to date.








Abstract
Gem&#8208;diboronic acid derivatives have previously been demonstrated to facilitate substrate binding within a metal's secondary coordination sphere, but their use as an anion recognition motif has not been explored. Here, we introduce the gem&#8208;diboronic acid motif as a highly effective group for recognition of oxoanions in aqueous solution. Anion receptors based on this motif demonstrate higher binding affinities than other common neutral motifs such as amides and (thio)ureas, and display a unique selectivity profile. Studies with a receptor bearing two gem&#8208;diboronic acid groups, receptor 2, indicate that the interaction with anions is highly directional. Despite its simplicity, receptor 2 represents one of the most selective receptors for malonate reported to date.

         <title>Leveraging Solvent Effects for Enhanced Oxidation and Coordination in Selective Piezocatalytic Gold Recovery from End&#8208;of&#8208;Life Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The choice of solvent in piezocatalytic Au extraction is critical to electron transfer, radical generation, and mass transport. The CH3CN&#8211;water solvent system emerges as the optimal medium, achieving a balance of oxidation ability, coordination ability, scalability, and environmental safety, resulting in a highly efficient and selective Au recovery.








Abstract
Efficient gold (Au) recovery from electronic waste (E&#8208;waste) under environmentally sustainable and mild conditions presents a significant challenge in resource recycling. This study introduced a novel piezocatalytic method for Au recovery from E&#8208;waste using a mixed acetonitrile&#8211;water (CH3CN&#8208;H2O) solution. The findings emphasize the crucial role of solvent effects in modulating catalytic performance, with a 75% CH3CN solution offering the most efficient recovery. The solvent not only influenced the oxidation and coordination steps crucial for Au extraction but also facilitated electron and mass transfer, accelerating the generation of reactive species that promote Au dissolution. Furthermore, water amplified the effect of the solvent by modifying the chemical potential of surface species, thus optimizing catalytic reactivity. Under ultrasonic vibration, the piezocatalytic system achieved 100% Au recovery from various types of E&#8208;waste, exhibiting excellent adaptability across a broad pH range. Large&#8208;scale experiments at the kilogram level confirmed its practicality, with 100% recovery from printed circuit boards and 98% from central processing unit boards. This study underscores the importance of solvent effects in piezocatalysis and provides new insights into the sustainable recovery of precious metals, thereby paving the way for the design of solvent&#8208;assisted catalytic systems.

         <title>Synthesis of Glycolipid Library Reminiscent of Mycobacterial Cell Wall Motif A and Its Significance by Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of glycolipids reminiscent of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall were synthesized and their supramolecular structures in aqueous acetone were imaged by transmission electron microscopy. The self&#8208;assembled structures are affected by subtle changes in the number of sugar residues, type of glycosidic linkages, and the presence or absence of cyclopropanes in the lipid.








Abstract
The cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) is distinguished by its unique glycolipid composition, notably mycolyl arabinogalactan, which features Araf, Galf, and mycolic acid. The terminal portion of arabinogalactan (AG) is motif A, a pentaarabinofuranoside characterized by two &#946;&#8208;1,2 linkages and one each of &#945;&#8208;1,5 and &#945;&#8208;1,3 linkages. The C5 positions of motif A are esterified with mycolic acids, further enriched by unusual cyclopropanes. In this study, we synthesized a diverse array of MTb cell wall glycolipids inspired by motif A and explored their self&#8208;assembly behavior using microscopy. This collection of glycolipids includes variations with &#945; or &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;2, 3, or 5) Araf linkages in di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and penta&#8208;arabinofuranosides, esterified with saturated, doubly unsaturated, or cyclopropanated long&#8208;chain fatty acids. The TEM analysis of the resulting self&#8208;assemblies revealed that subtle modifications in the anomeric linkages, length of the glycan, and the presence or absence of cyclopropanes impacted the morphology of the self&#8208;assembled structures.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Minute Fabrication of Metal Organic Framework Membranes via Additive&#8208;Accelerated Electrodeposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sub&#8208;minute fabrication of permselective metal organic framework membranes via additive&#8208;accelerated electrodeposition is developed by using catecholamine as both biomimetic mineralization inducer and grain&#8208;boundary adhesive. The resulting ZIF&#8208;8@DA membranes exhibited excellent C3H6/C3H8 separation performance with C3H6 permeance of 145&#160;&#177;&#160;12 GPU and C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 151&#160;&#177;&#160;8, surpassing most of MOF membranes.








Abstract
Efficient fabrication of metal organic framework (MOF) membranes is important for their broad applications in molecular separations. However, current approaches for MOF membrane fabrication are usually time&#8208;consuming due to the slow, random nucleation and crystal growth, particularly the lack of in&#8208;situ defect healing ability. Here, we report an additive&#8208;accelerated electrodeposition method, which allows ultrafast fabrication of MOF membranes through the synergy of electric field and catecholamine additives. The strong electric field facilitates the directed nucleation of MOF on the substrates while the multifunctional additives accelerate the MOF crystallization, growth and grain&#8208;boundary defect healing. Consequently, we fabricate well&#8208;intergrown, uniform MOF (ZIF&#8208;8) membranes with an ultrathin thickness of &#8764;180&#160;nm in 30 s, which is the most rapid fabrication of MOF membranes till now. The membranes exhibit superior C3H6/C3H8 separation performance with a C3H6 permeance of 145 GPU and a C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 151, as well as good stability at high pressure of 7&#160;bar, and the ultrafast membrane fabrication can be achieved on commercial ceramic substrates, exhibiting the potential for practical applications. This work may establish a platform for fast and controllable fabrication of MOF membranes as well as many other membranes based on metal&#8208;coordination chemistry.

         <title>Highly Selective Electrocatalytic 1,4&#8208;NADH Regeneration Based on Host&#8211;Guest Recognition Mediated by Cucurbit[8]uril on NiO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the catalytic pocket and enzyme&#8211;substrate interaction, an electrochemical 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration route was designed based on host&#8211;guest recognition mediated by cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) on NiO. The anchored CB[8] could preorganize the NAD+ in a reaction&#8208;ready configuration to approach the Ni&#8208;Had on NiO, resulting in a high regioselectivity up to 97.8%. 








Abstract
Efficient regeneration of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) cofactors, particularly 1,4&#8208;NADH, is crucial for advancing oxidoreductase catalysis. Electrocatalysis provides a promising route for 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration, but an expensive catalyst, typically a rhodium organometallic complex, is frequently required to guarantee the high selectivity of 1,4&#8208;NADH, significantly limiting its large&#8208;scale application. Herein, inspired by the catalytic pocket and enzyme&#8211;substrate interaction in nature, a direct electrochemical 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration route was designed by modification of the surface of nickel oxide (NiO) with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) (denoted as CB[8]&#8211;NiO). The host&#8211;guest interaction between CB[8] and NAD+ was proved, which is similar in principle to substrate&#8211;enzyme&#8208;specific recognition. CB[8] acted as a catalytic pocket for NAD+, providing a suitable cavity volume to accommodate the positively charged nicotinamide part of NAD+. NAD+ entered the CB[8] cavity and approached the surface&#8208;adsorbed hydrogen atoms on NiO in a reaction&#8208;ready configuration to achieve the regioselective 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration. Remarkably higher 1,4&#8208;NADH selectivity of 97.8% on CB[8]&#8211;NiO was obtained at &#8722;0.47&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) than that of bare NiO (77.4%).

A largest all&#8208;alkynyl protected rod&#8208;shaped Au9Ag126&#8208;xCux(PhC&#63741;C)68(BF4)5 (x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;20) (1) (PhC&#63741;C&#160;=&#160;phenylacetylene) trimetallic nanocluster has been synthesized and its structure determined by SCXRD. Cluster 1 contains a concentric metal kernel in the manner of shell&#8208;by&#8208;shell arrangements of Au3Ag34@Au6Ag64@(AgCu)28. Compared to other reported Au/Ag/Cu/Pd based nanoclusters, 1 exhibits exceptional photothermal conversion capability (&#951;&#160;=&#160;84.7%, &#9651;T&#160;=&#160;51.5 &#176;C, &#955;ex&#160;=&#160;660&#160;nm, 0.5&#160;W cm&#8722;2, 12&#160;&#181;M). TA spectroscopy reveals that the &#964;e&#8208;ph of excited 1 occurs on the femtosecond timescale, resulting in an ultrafast electronic relaxation process and excellent photothermal performance. Cluster 1 shows excellent photothermal therapy of cancer cells at low concentration and low laser power.








Abstract
High&#8208;nuclearity intermetallic nanoclusters are important for investigating the evolution of alloy materials from atoms to plasmonic alloy nanoparticles. However, the synthesis of large&#8208;size alloy nanoclusters (&#8764;2&#160;nm) is still challenging. In this work, an all&#8208;alkynyl protected trimetallic nanocluster of unprecedented size, Au9Ag126&#8208;xCux(PhC&#63741;C)68(BF4)5 (x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;20) (1) (PhC&#63741;C&#160;=&#160;phenylacetylene), has been synthesized and its total structure determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD). The metal core of 1 is rod&#8208;like in structure, with a length of 1.92&#160;nm and a width of 1.45&#160;nm. Cluster 1 contains a concentric metal kernel in the manner of shell&#8208;by&#8208;shell arrangements of Au3Ag34@Au6Ag64@(AgCu)28 protected by 68 PhC&#63741;C ligands with 15 distinct alkynyl&#8211;metal binding configurations. Theoretic calculation reveals that 1 features a HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap of 0.29&#160;eV. This suggests that 1 is situated at the boundary of the transition from a molecular to a metallic state. Remarkably, compared to other reported Au/Ag/Cu/Pd based nanoclusters, 1 exhibits significantly enhanced photothermal conversion capability. A substantial temperature rise of &#8764;51.5 &#176;C within 5&#160;min (&#955;ex&#160;=&#160;660&#160;nm, 0.5&#160;W cm&#8722;2) and a record high photothermal conversion efficiency of 84.7% at 12&#160;&#181;M in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) were observed. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy reveals that the electron&#8211;phonon coupling (&#964;e&#8208;ph) of excited 1 occurs on the femtosecond timescale, resulting in an ultrafast electronic relaxation process and excellent photothermal performance. Cluster 1, when employed as a photothermal material, shows promise in biothermal therapy, photothermal catalysis, and photothermal imaging.

         <title>Balancing Hydrogen Evolution and Hydrogenation Reaction via Facet Engineering for Efficient Conversion of Nitrate to Ammonia in Actual Wastewater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a critical insight into the hydrogenation mechanism, implying that facet engineering can balance hydrogen evolution and hydrogenation reaction. The Co3O4(100) facet with abundant oxygen vacancies can not only boost water dissociation to generate active hydrogen but also effectively utilize these intermediates for nitrate reduction, thereby shifting the reaction pathway from hydrogen evolution to hydrogenation reaction.








Abstract
Due to the competitive relationship between nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the conventional approach to improve Faradaic efficiency is to select a catalyst without HER activity. Nevertheless, such a strategy not only limits the application of HER catalysts in NO3&#8722;RR, but also causes insufficient hydrogen source, thereby sacrificing ammonia yield rate. We believe that HER catalysts should not be excluded from hydrogenation reduction. Herein, taking traditional water electrolysis material Co3O4 as model system, we reveal that the oxygen vacancies on crystal facet can greatly promote water dissociation and capture HER intermediate for NO3&#8722;RR, successfully shifting the reaction pathway from hydrogen evolution to nitrate hydrogenation. Beyond material development, we construct a hybrid reactor and achieve an ammonia recovery rate of 1216.8&#160;g&#8208;N&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;d&#8722;1 in nuclear industry wastewater with ultra&#8208;high nitrate concentration. This study breaks through the limitation of HER catalyst in NO3&#8722;RR, which provides a significant insight into the catalyst designing and hydrogenation mechanism.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We first reveal an overlooked issue of water migration in decoupled systems, which leads to sulfur species dissolution and thus irreversible sulfur redox reactions. By investigating the alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;driven water migration, the MPI of the electrolyte is proposed as a universal descriptor. In practice, an alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;H2O&#8208;poor coordination strategy is proven effective in resolving water migration and constructing stable alkali ion&#8208;SABs effectively.








Abstract
Sulfur aqueous battery (SAB) is promising owing to its high theoretical capacity and cost competitiveness. Although decoupled electrolyte design has successfully endowed transition metal ion&#8208;SABs with customizability to achieve high energy density, its effectiveness in alkali ion&#8208;SABs remains problematic. Here, we identify for the first time an intractable phenomenon of alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;driven water migration between decoupled electrolytes through ex situ NMR, which is recognized as the origin of the irreversible sulfur redox reactions. To address the challenge, we propose an alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;H2O&#8208;poor coordination strategy to effectively regulate water migration by incorporating low molecular polarity index (MPI) anions. In situ Raman, synchrotron spectroscopy, and molecule dynamic simulations reveal that the repulsion of low MPI anions to water effectively disrupts the hydration patterns around the alkali cations, and thereby minimizes the concomitant water migration. The elaborated Na+&#8208;SAB achieved an ultrahigh capacity of 1634&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (97.7% sulfur utilization) and prolonged stability over 500 cycles. Furthermore, the versatility of the alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;H2O&#8208;poor coordination strategy is further substantiated in Li+&#8208;SAB and K+&#8208;SAB batteries, boosting the scope of the following SAB systems.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Ultraviolet Light&#8208;Activated Asymmetric Photopolymerization for the Synthesis of CPL&#8208;Active Materials</title>

This work develops a high&#8208;performance circularly polarized ultraviolet light (CP&#8208;UVL, &#955;em&#160;=&#160;360&#160;nm, gem&#160;=&#160;0.188), achieved through thermodynamic regulation of the chiral supramolecular assembly. The asymmetric photopolymerization of RM257&#8208;based blend film can be realized by utilizing the CP&#8208;UVL as a chiral excitation source, resulting in the generation of blue CPL (&#955;em&#160;=&#160;460&#160;nm, gem&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.072).








Abstract
Circularly polarized ultraviolet light (CP&#8208;UVL) offers significant potential for practical applications in asymmetric photocatalysis and photopolymerization. However, the development of CP&#8208;UVL&#8208;active materials has been hindered by their low emission dissymmetry factors (gem). Here, we present a high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;UVL material for asymmetric photopolymerization, achieved through thermodynamic regulation of a chiral supramolecular assembly. The chiral coassembled enantiomers, R/S&#8208;BNC/OXD&#8208;7, are synthesized using the naphthylamine derivative R/S&#8208;BNC as the chiral donor and OXD&#8208;7 as the achiral acceptor. Upon annealing at different temperatures, OXD&#8208;7 detaches from the chiral coassembly of S&#8208;BNC/OXD&#8208;7 and then self&#8208;assembles into ordered helical nanostructures, exhibiting temperature&#8208;dependent CP&#8208;UVL (&#955;em = 360&#160;nm, with gem up to&#160;+0.188). Remarkably, the strong CP&#8208;UVL emission acts as a chiral excitation source, triggering the asymmetric photopolymerization of RM257 (which contains the achiral dye TPABBI and the photoinitiator Irg651), resulting in the generation of blue CPL (&#955;em&#160;=&#160;460&#160;nm, gem&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.072). This study provides a simple yet effective strategy for designing high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;UVL materials for CPL&#8208;induced asymmetric photopolymerization.

         <title>Selectively Deoxygenative Deuteration of Aldehydes by Superwetting Porous Carbon&#8208;Supported Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a class of superwetting carbon&#8208;supported Pd catalysts, which facilitate the site&#8208;specific deoxygenative deuteration of aldehydes to aromatics with &#8208;CD3 group benefitting from the catalyst's surface polarity and electron&#8208;rich effect.








Abstract
We present a method of deoxygenative deuteration of aldehydes (DDA) over heterogeneously superwetting porous carbon&#8208;supported palladium catalyst (Pd/SPC), which is efficient for the synthesis of deuterated aromatic compounds with &#8208;CD3 group. Exemplified by the DDA reaction of 2&#8208;naphthaldehyde (2&#8208;NAL) to 2&#8208;methylnaphthalene (2&#8208;MNE), the total deuterium incorporation radio in the resultant aromatic hydrocarbons was higher than 95% and the selectivity toward 2&#8208;MNE&#8208;d3 reached 87%. The impressed catalytic activity was found relevant to the combined effect of surface wettability and the electron&#8208;rich properties of Pd species of this kind of heterogeneous Pd/SPC catalyst. Mechanistic studies suggest a successive deuteration pathway, that is, hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE), deuterium addition, and ultimate deoxygenative deuteration over Pd/SPC in the cost&#8208;effective D2O/H2 reaction conditions. The in situ&#8208;formed D2 from the first step HIE between H2 and D2O can be readily captured by the electron&#8208;rich Pd centers, which then boost the subsequent deuterogenolysis of C&#9472;O bonds through deuterated alcohol intermediates toward the formation of 2&#8208;MNE&#8208;d3. This work provides a design principle of heterogeneous catalysts for targeted deuterium labeling from aldehyde substrates and may inspire the development of alternative deuterium labeling techniques beyond dominated homogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Pd Ensemble Sites Tuned Local Environment of Cu Catalysts for Matching Propyne Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction pathways of catalytic hydrogenations exemplified by the propyne hydrogenation here are obediently regulated by manipulating the local environments. The presence of Pd ensemble sites is shown to enable a facile dissociation of hydrogen and control the hydrogenation via the semi&#8208;hydrogenation pathway, which contributes to high activity and selectivity for propyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.








Abstract
Tailoring local environments of active sites to match targeted configuration of key species is significant for controlling reaction pathways in selective hydrogenations. Herein, differently typed Pd sites are introduced onto Cu catalysts to tune the local environment of Cu sites for controlling the configuration of semi&#8208;hydrogenation pathway of propyne hydrogenation used in production of polymer&#8208;grade propylene. Detailed structure characterizations demonstrate the controllable construction of Pd single&#8208;atom and Pd ensemble sites modified Cu surfaces and PdCu alloy via fine tuning the Pd/Cu ratios. Catalytic tests, kinetics analysis, and temperature&#8208;programmed experiments demonstrate that the presence of Pd ensemble sites on Cu surface directly catalyzes the hydrogenation of propyne that occurs on the Cu sites in other cases, and enables a facile activation for hydrogen and simultaneously promotes the desorption of propylene against its hydrogenation. Accordingly, the selectivity to target propylene is up to 95.3% at the full conversion of propyne on the corresponding Pd0.1Cu catalyst. In contrast, the C&#9472;C coupling pathway is quite facile on the Cu surface tuned by single&#8208;atom Pd sites, which is similar to that on the pristine Cu sites on the Cu catalyst, and the well&#8208;defined Pd&#9472;Cu coordination on PdCu alloy catalyst leads to facile over&#8208;hydrogenation process.

         <title>Blocking Orbital &#960;&#8208;Conjugation to Boost Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling in Carbonyl&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Heteroaromatic Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective approach, i.e., blocking orbital &#960;&#8208;conjugation via either molecular&#8208;structure distortion or meta&#8208;arrangement of chemical substituents is proposed, to boost spin&#8208;orbit couplings (SOC) in carbonyl&#8208;embedded polycyclic heteroatomic emitters. This work not only provides a deep insight into the structure&#8208;property relationship on SOC but also opens the door for designing more efficient OLED emitters with large SOCs.








Abstract
Both reducing singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#916;ES1T1) and enhancing spin&#8208;orbit couplings (SOCs) are key to improving reverse intersystem crossing rates (kRISC) in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. While considerable efforts have focused on reducing &#916;ES1T1, investigations on SOCs remain limited. Here, blocking &#960;&#8208;conjugation in carbonyl&#8208;embedded polycyclic heteroaromatic (PHA) molecules as potential approach to elevate &#960;&#960;* excitation energy, allowing its hybridization with n&#960;* excitation, thereby increasing SOCs is proposed. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept isomers, DNDK&#8208;1 and DNDK&#8208;2 are synthesized, with different orientations of carbonyl units. DNDK&#8208;1 adopts a heavily twisted structure that hinders &#960;&#8208;conjugation, while DNDK&#8208;2 remains quasi&#8208;planar, maintaining stronger &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Experimental measurements reveals stark differences in their photophysical properties, with DNDK&#8208;1 exhibiting faster kRISC and much higher electroluminescence efficiency. The ab&#8208;initio calculations elucidate that hindered conjugation in DNDK&#8208;1 elevates &#960;&#960;* excitation energy, enabling n&#960;*&#8208;&#960;&#960;* mixing, thus significantly boosting SOCs. In contrast, smooth &#960;&#8208;conjugation in DNDK&#8208;2 leads to marginal n&#960;*&#8208;&#960;&#960;* mixing. In addition, utilizing groups composed of meta&#8208;arranged carbonyl&#8208;Ar&#8208;carbonyl and meta&#8208;arranged N&#8208;Ar&#8208;N units emerges as another approach to block &#960;&#8208;conjugation and enhance SOCs. This joint experimental and theoretical work provides promising pathways to enhance SOCs by blocking &#960;&#8208;conjugation, offering crucial insights for designing carbonyl&#8208;embedded PHA emitters with larger SOCs.

&lt;p&gt;An effective approach, i.e., blocking orbital &#960;-conjugation via either molecular-structure distortion or meta-arrangement of chemical substituents is proposed, to boost spin-orbit couplings (SOC) in carbonyl-embedded polycyclic heteroatomic emitters.

         <title>Impact of Hydrogen Vacancies on Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination in Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen vacancies in hybrid perovskites have a dramatic influence on the non&#8208;radiative recombination. It can exhibit multiple metastable configurations, resulting in variations in carrier capture coefficient by over 10 orders of magnitude. By uncovering the negligible role of hydrogen vacancies on the non&#8208;radiative recombination losses, this work shifts the focus toward more significant defects, for instance, iodine interstitial, thereby paving the way for optimizing perovskite solar cells (PSCs) efficiency to meet the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit.








Abstract
Hydrogen vacancies (VH) were considered major non&#8208;radiative recombination centers in hybrid perovskites. By employing a multiscale approach that combines first&#8208;principles calculations and molecular dynamics (MDs) simulations, our findings indicated that the VH impact was overestimated due to the previous metastable VH configurations. The organic molecules with VH located on either the nitrogen or carbon atom act as the ligands that form energetically stable dimers with Pb2+ cations. These dimers lower VH energy by 0.35&#8211;0.97&#160;eV in MAPbI3 and by 0.88&#8211;1.01&#160;eV in FAPbI3, compared to non&#8208;bonding configurations. These dimers significantly boosted potential energy barriers of hole capture, resulting in a dramatic reduction in carrier capture coefficients by over 10 orders of magnitude. Consequently, the total capture coefficients (Ctotal) for the dominant VH in MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 are on the order of 10&#8722;17 and 10&#8722;31 cm&#8722;3s&#8722;1, respectively. By uncovering the negligible impact of VH on non&#8208;radiative recombination, this work shifts the focus toward more significant defects, for instance, iodine interstitial (with a capture coefficient on the order of 10&#8722;8 cm&#8722;3s&#8722;1), thereby paving the way for optimizing perovskite solar cells efficiency to meet the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit.

         <title>Steering the Product Selectivity of CO2&#160;Electroreduction by Single Atom Switching in Isostructural Copper Nanocluster Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of isostructural Cu nanoclusters (Cu13 and Cu14) with one&#8208;atom&#8208;change was synthesized by precisely single atom manipulation. One atom switching steers electrochemical CO2 reduction direction, in which Cu13 shows barely activity towards only 2e product CO with a maximum 13% FE at &#8722;1.1&#160;V, while, Cu14 can promote CO2 deep reduction to hydrocarbons (CH4 and C2H4) with maximum FE of 54.3% at &#8722;1.2&#160;V.








Abstract
Even single atom manipulation can cause drastic changes in catalytic activity and selectivity, especially in atomic&#8208;level catalysts. However, it is challenging to accurately elucidate the influence of specific atoms on performance due to the intertwined factors in catalysts. Atomically precise isostructural nanoclusters (NCs) can serve as ideal platforms to uncover the impact of individual atoms on catalytic properties. Herein, a pair of isostructural Cu NCs ([Cu13(SC6H3F2)3(P(PhF)3)7H10]0 and [Cu14(SC6H3F2)3(P(PhF)3)8H10]+ namely as Cu13 and Cu14) were synthesized. In the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, Cu13 shows barely any activity toward only 2e product CO with a maximum 13% FE at &#8722;1.1&#160;V. In contrast, Cu14 can promote CO2 deep reduction to hydrocarbons (CH4 and C2H4) with maximum FE of 54.3% at &#8722;1.2&#160;V. Based on the crystallographic and computational analyses, the extra Cu at the top in Cu14 squeezes the H connected with three core Cu into the center of the same plane, optimizing the electronic structure and thereby promoting CO2 activation and H2O dissociation, which is further confirmed by comprehensive in situ characterizations, kinetic experiments, and theoretical calculations. This work provides a unique isostructural NCs system to gain fundamental insights into switching catalytic reactivity by single&#8208;atom manipulation.

         <title>Polyarylmethylpiperidinium (PAMP) for Next Generation Anion Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

Novel polyarylmethylpiperidinium (PAMP) AEM with pendant piperidinium structures are effectively designed and synthesized, laying the foundation for the development of next&#8208;generation AEMs for applications in highly stable AEM&#8208;WEs.








Abstract
Terawatt&#8208;scale hydrogen production using anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM&#8208;WEs) requires the development of facilely prepared, alkali&#8208;stable, and high&#8208;performance anion exchange membranes (AEMs). State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polyarylpiperidinium AEMs fail to match the alkaline stability of piperidinium due to conformational deformation caused by the stiff cardo structure. Herein, polyarylmethylpiperidinium (PAMP) AEM with pendant structure is constructed by utilizing 4&#8208;formylpiperidine as a functional monomer. The inclusion of an aldehyde group in the synthesis enhances polymerization reactivity, reduces the amount of superacid required, and ensures that the piperidinium is suspended from the ether&#8208;free polymer backbone.

&lt;p&gt;Novel polyarylmethylpiperidinium (PAMP) AEM with pendant piperidinium structures are effectively designed and synthesized, laying the foundation for the development of next-generation AEMs for applications in highly stable AEM-WEs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terawatt-scale hydrogen production using anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM-WEs) requires the development of facilely prepared, alkali-stable, and high-performance anion exchange membranes (AEMs). State-of-the-art polyarylpiperidinium AEMs fail to match the alkaline stability of piperidinium due to conformational deformation caused by the stiff cardo structure. Herein, polyarylmethylpiperidinium (PAMP) AEM with pendant structure is constructed by utilizing 4-formylpiperidine as a functional monomer. The inclusion of an aldehyde group in the synthesis enhances polymerization reactivity, reduces the amount of superacid required, and ensures that the piperidinium is suspended from the ether-free polymer backbone. The accelerated aging analysis demonstrates that the pendant structure of piperidinium effectively suppresses the Hofmann elimination, resulting in PAMP AEM with exceptional alkali stability, surpassing that of the commercial PiperION-A40. Most importantly, when assembled with non-noble metal OER/HER catalysts, the related AEM-WE achieves a remarkably high transient current density of 7.35 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (@2&#160;V, 80&#160;&#176;C, 1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH). Moreover, the AEM-WE can operate stably at industrial current density over 1500&#160;h (&#8776;1.70&#160;V at 1.0 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron Single&#8208;Atom Based Double&#8208;Reaction&#8208;Center Catalysis Triggers Internal&#8208;Driven and External&#8208;Driven Pathways for Green Fenton&#8208;Like Chemistry</title>

Iron single atoms in double&#8208;reaction&#8208;centers (DRCs)&#8208;based catalysts substituted the oxidants and dissolved oxygen as the predominate electron acceptors to extract the electrons from the electron&#8208;donating pollutants with iron valence decreasing from +2.37 to +2.07, and they could also be recovered under O2 atmosphere.








Abstract
Double&#8208;reaction&#8208;centers (DRCs) Fenton&#8208;like chemistry with low or zero oxidant addition has garnered increasing attentions due to their alignment with the principles of green and sustainable development. However, the regulation of such processes remains a significant challenge, primarily due to deficiencies in the microscopic interpretation of their electron migration mechanisms operating with low or zero oxidant addition. In this work, iron single&#8208;atom DRCs catalyst (Fe/N&#8208;SAC) was prepared for internal&#8208;driven system (zero oxidant addition) and external&#8208;driven system (low peroxymonosulfate [PMS] addition). Results indicated the absence of dissolved oxygen activation in the PMS&#8208;zreo Fe/N&#8208;SAC system, and the iron single atoms in the Fe/N&#8208;SAC acted as the predominate electron acceptors to extract the electrons from the electron&#8208;donating pollutants with iron valence decreasing from +2.37 to +2.07 and they could also be recovered under O2 atmosphere. In contrast, the electrons from the pollutants could be transferred to both PMS and iron atoms in the external&#8208;driven Fe/N&#8208;SAC/PMS system involving both predominant electron transfer process (ETP) and iron internal&#8208;driven. Furthermore, two experimental devices based on core mechanisms of internal&#8208;driven and external&#8208;driven systems were designed to achieve long&#8208;term operation. These studies will complement the core catalytic mechanisms and module applications of internal&#8208;driven and external&#8208;driven DRCs systems.

         <title>Engineered Polymeric Microspheres with Synergistic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Nanotraps and Multisite Adsorption for Ultrafast Herbicide Decontamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

Crosslinked polymer microsphere &#947;CD&#8208;PF was constructed utilizing hydrogen bond&#8208;incorporating cyclodextrins and conjugated hexafluorocyclotriphosphazene. The removal efficiencies exceeding 98% for PQ and DQ within 5&#160;s, with pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order adsorption kinetics constants (k2) of 127.09 and 192.64&#160;g mg&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, respectively. The ultrafast adsoprtion is facilitated by a hydrogen&#8208;bond nanotrap&#8208;dominated multisite adsorption, which follows an initial electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction&#8208;induced surface enrichment.








Abstract
The ultrafast removal of trace herbicides like paraquat (PQ) and diquat (DQ) from water is urgent yet challenging due to their highwater stability and strong&#8208;binding properties. Here, efficient PQ and DQ removal based on hydrogen&#8208;bonding nanotraps dominant multisite adsorption were developed. Two crosslinked polymeric microspheres, &#946;CD&#8208;PF and &#947;CD&#8208;PF, were synthesized from cyclodextrins (CDs) and hexafluorocyclotriphosphazene (HFP). The &#947;CD&#8208;PF microsphere with sufficient hydrogen&#8208;bonding nanotraps on the pore surface prompts adsorption kinetics constants of PQ and DQ up to 127.09 and 192.64&#160;g mg&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, achieving 99% removal efficiency for PQ and DQ within 5&#160;s. &#947;CD&#8208;PF exhibits exceptional selectivity for PQ and DQ over larger competing dyes. Importantly, trace PQ (1&#160;ppm) can be effectively treated with &#947;CD&#8208;PF to achieve a concentration far below the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard (0.003&#160;ppm) within 30&#160;s. The ultrafast adsorption is driven by a multisite mechanism: electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions from HFP promote adsorbate accumulation on the CD surface, while the high&#8208;density hydrogen&#8208;bonding nanotraps in &#947;CD&#8208;PF enhance hydrogen bond strength, enabling rapid capture. This work provides a valuable strategy for designing ultrafast adsorbents for effective herbicide removal from water.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Activated Near Infrared/Shortwave Infrared Emissive Chromophores: Synthesis of Triphenylamine&#8208;Appended Pyrazinacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active triphenylamine&#8208;appended pyrazinacenes show extreme reversible redox&#8208;coupled switching of their photophysical properties. In their reduced state, absorption and emission bands fall well within the visible region. Oxidation results in a shift in the absorption and fluorescence bands to the near infrared and short&#8208;wave infrared regions while maintaining high fluorescence quantum yields.








Abstract
Organic dyes showing absorbance and fluorescence in the near infrared and short&#8208;wave infrared regions are attractive for a variety of applications. Redox&#8208;coupled reversible switching of absorbance or fluorescence implies enhanced functionality of such dyes, especially where large changes in photophysical properties across the redox process can be realized. Here, the synthesis of two new pyrazinacenes containing four and five fused pyrazine units, appended with electron&#8208;donor triphenylamine groups, and redox&#8208;coupled switching of their photophysical properties is reported. In their reduced state, the compounds show absorbance and fluorescence in the visible region. Reversible shifts in absorbance and fluorescence from the visible to the near infrared or even short&#8208;wave infrared regions are observed upon chemical and electrochemical oxidations. Such large redox&#8208;coupled shifts in photophysical properties are unprecedented for a redox process that affects only a single, six&#8208;membered ring in which both reduced and oxidized states consist of neutral, closed&#8208;shell species. The compounds show high fluorescence quantum yields in their reduced states, and oxidized species show fluorescence quantum yields that compare well with existing near infrared and short&#8208;wave infrared active fluorescent dyes.

         <title>Universal Albumin Drugs&#8208;Cored Spherical Nucleic Acid (ad&#8208;SNA) Platform for Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By one&#8208;step aptamer modification of FDA&#8208;approved albumin drugs, we developed a versatile albumin drugs&#8208;spherical nucleic acid (adSNA) platform with tumor&#8208;targeting specificity, high aptamer&#8208;grafting efficiency, diverse drug loading capabilities, and simplified preparation with reduced costs. This platform achieves precise drug delivery, shows promising tumor mild photothermal therapy, and allows single&#8208;batch synthesis for clinical translation.








Abstract
Albumin&#8208;based drug delivery system, exemplified by FDA&#8208;approved treatments like Abraxane, have demonstrated significant potential in cancer therapy. However, albumin carriers still suffer from poor tumor&#8208;targeting capability, leading to low efficacy and systemic side effects on healthy cells in applications. Here, we report a general method for modification of albumin drugs by aptamer coating shell that are hydrophobically inserted into the albumin surface, for constructing albumin drugs&#8208;cored spherical nucleic acid (adSNA). This adSNA platform allows for the versatile loading of various therapeutic agents, including chemotherapy drugs, polyphenols, cuproptosis inducers, and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizers, enabling targeted tumor delivery. Compared with covalent method, the hydrophobic insertion method has been proven to be of greater simplicity, higher aptamer&#8208;grafting efficiency, superior tumor&#8208;targeting capabilities, and comparable stability under physiological conditions. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we delivered NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents and heat shock protein inhibitors for tumor&#8208;specific mild photothermal therapy. Compared to traditional photothermal therapy (PTT), this approach utilizes NIR&#8208;II PTT agents to achieve greater tissue penetration while downregulating heat shock proteins in tumor cells, resulting in precise thermal ablation at lower temperatures.

     alt="Universal Albumin Drugs-Cored Spherical Nucleic Acid (ad-SNA) Platform for Targeted Drug Delivery"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By one-step aptamer modification of FDA-approved albumin drugs, we developed a versatile albumin drugs-spherical nucleic acid (adSNA) platform with tumor-targeting specificity, high aptamer-grafting efficiency, diverse drug loading capabilities, and simplified preparation with reduced costs. This platform achieves precise drug delivery, shows promising tumor mild photothermal therapy, and allows single-batch synthesis for clinical translation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albumin-based drug delivery system, exemplified by FDA-approved treatments like Abraxane, have demonstrated significant potential in cancer therapy. However, albumin carriers still suffer from poor tumor-targeting capability, leading to low efficacy and systemic side effects on healthy cells in applications. Here, we report a general method for modification of albumin drugs by aptamer coating shell that are hydrophobically inserted into the albumin surface, for constructing albumin drugs-cored spherical nucleic acid (adSNA). This adSNA platform allows for the versatile loading of various therapeutic agents, including chemotherapy drugs, polyphenols, cuproptosis inducers, and near-infrared (NIR) photosensitizers, enabling targeted tumor delivery. Compared with covalent method, the hydrophobic insertion method has been proven to be of greater simplicity, higher aptamer-grafting efficiency, superior tumor-targeting capabilities, and comparable stability under physiological conditions. In a proof-of-concept study, we delivered NIR-II photothermal agents and heat shock protein inhibitors for tumor-specific mild photothermal therapy. Compared to traditional photothermal therapy (PTT), this approach utilizes NIR-II PTT agents to achieve greater tissue penetration while downregulating heat shock proteins in tumor cells, resulting in precise thermal ablation at lower temperatures.

         <title>Precise PBAEs: A Highly Efficient Single&#8208;Molecularly Defined Gene&#8208;Delivery System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, single&#8208;molecularly defined poly(&#946;&#8208;amino esters) are synthesized for gene delivery. These precisely defined polymers exhibit relatively high gene&#8208;delivery efficiency and low toxicity, highlighting their potential for advanced therapeutic applications. The precise polymers also reveal new design principles for polymer&#8208;based gene&#8208;delivery vectors, emphasizing the impact of structural precision.








Abstract
Gene&#8208;delivery polymers have wide therapeutic applications. The structures (e.g., molecular weight, polymer sequence, end groups, and topology) of gene&#8208;delivery polymers are of crucial importance to their properties including transfection efficiency, toxicity, and targeting capability. Thus, precise control over the structures of gene&#8208;delivery polymers is extremely beneficial for property optimizations and manufacturing reproducibility. However, sequence&#8208;defined gene&#8208;delivery polymers with high efficiency and low toxicity are rare, limited by synthetic strategies. In this work, we developed a method that enables poly(&#946;&#8208;amino esters), one of the most promising gene&#8208;delivery polymers, to be synthesized with precisely controlled and vastly variable molecular weight, end group, and topology. This synthetic strategy creates a new family of gene&#8208;delivery polymers with defined structures, offering significant potentials and revealing new design principles.

         <title>Kinetic Redox Shotgun Proteomics Reveals Specific Lipopolysaccharide Effects on Intestinal Epithelial Cells, Mitigated by a Mn Superoxide Dismutase Mimic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteomics and redoxomics are efficient to quantify the effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide in intestinal epithelial cells (HT29) at the proteome and at the Cys&#8208;redoxome levels. Oxidative stress is the initial trigger of LPS leading to inflammation. A Mn&#8208;based superoxide mimetic (or mimic) was able to reduce oxidative stress and to mitigate the effects at the proteome level.








Abstract
Overproduction of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant superoxide dismutases (SOD1, SOD2) dysregulation contribute to chronic inflammation such as generated in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). A kinetic redox shotgun proteomic strategy (OcSILAC for Oxidized cysteine Stable Isotope Labelling by Amino acids in Cell culture) was used to explore the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) effects including LPS&#8208;induced oxidation and inflammation cascades on a dedicated intestinal epithelial cell line (HT29&#8208;MD2) together with the potential mitigating role of a Mn&#8208;based SOD&#8208;mimic Mn1. While LPS induced transient oxidative damages at early times (15&#160;min), cells incubated with Mn1 showed, in this time frame, a significantly reduced cysteine oxidation, highlighting Mn1 antioxidant properties. Over time, cysteine oxidation of LPS&#8208;treated cells was counteracted by an overexpression of antioxidant proteins (SOD1, NQO1) and a late (6&#160;h) preponderant increase in SOD2 level. Mn1, when co&#8208;incubated with LPS, attenuated the level of most LPS&#8208;modified proteins, that is, proteins involved in the inflammatory response. Our results highlight Mn1 as a potentially effective antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory agent to consider in the treatment of IBD, as well as a useful tool for exploring the interconnection between oxidative stress and inflammation.

         <title>Establishing an Efficient Electron Transfer System for P450 Enzyme OleP to Improve the Biosynthesis of Murideoxycholic Acid by Redox Partner Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic redox partner engineering strategy is proposed for three&#8208;component P450s, including selection, reconstitution, engineering, and analysis of the most suitable redox partner. The applied engineering strategies, high&#8208;throughput screening methods, and analytical approaches provide a feasible way to construct an ideal redox partner for other P450 enzymes.








Abstract
The electron transfer from NAD(P)H to heme is a rate&#8208;limiting step in the redox partner&#8208;mediated catalysis of P450 enzyme. However, due to the lack of efficient engineering strategies, it is difficult to improve the properties of redox partner. Herein, we construct an effective approach to modify the redox partner for a typical P450 enzyme (OleP) that can catalyze the stereoselective conversion of lithocholic acid to murideoxycholic acid. First, the combination of computational modeling and experimental validation was performed to rapidly identify the most suitable redox partner (PetH/PetF). Next, the interactions between PetF and OleP were investigated and the engineering on PetF was conducted to enhance the efficiency of electron transfer. Using a novel microplate screening method, a superior mutant (PetFF64D) was efficiently selected, which exhibited a significant enhancement in MDCA conversion yield from 32.5% to 80.9% and total turnover number (TTN) from 406.2 to 1617.9. Finally, through a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, the analysis of electron transfer pathway, and the calculations of electron transfer rate, the mechanism of electron transfer was investigated. The applied engineering strategies, high&#8208;throughput screening methods, and analytical approaches provide a feasible way to construct an ideal redox partner for other P450 enzymes.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Post&#8208;Perovskite for Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Hard X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;perovskite semiconductors with densities exceeding 5&#160;g&#160;cm&#8315;3 were achieved through edge&#8208; and face&#8208;sharing connectivity of octahedra and strong polarization between metal and chalcogenide ions. These dense materials retain semiconductor properties while exhibiting superior electrical transport characteristics. The assembled BiCuSCl2 post&#8208;perovskite detector exhibited excellent X&#8208;ray absorption capacity and high X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity.








Abstract
The density properties of semiconductors play a crucial role in applications, such as radiation detection, electronic devices, and aerospace technologies. However, controlling the density of semiconductors often leads to significant alterations in their electronic structure, which can result in the loss of their original semiconductor properties. Perovskite semiconductors, known for their excellent carrier transport properties, face limitations in hard X&#8208;ray detection due to their relatively low density and loose atomic packing. This study explores a series of post&#8208;perovskite semiconductors with densities exceeding 5&#160;g&#160;cm&#8315;3, achieved through edge&#8208; and face&#8208;sharing connectivity of octahedra and strong polarization between metal and chalcogenide ions. These dense materials retain semiconductor properties while exhibiting superior electrical transport characteristics. When applied to hard X&#8208;ray detection, the post&#8208;perovskite materials demonstrated superior attenuation cross&#8208;sections compared to the heaviest 3D CsPbI3 perovskite and 0D Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite. Specifically, the BiCuSCl2 post&#8208;perovskite detector exhibited a high sensitivity of 4126&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a minimum detection limit of 4.3&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1. The enhanced density also mitigates ionic migration, ensuring excellent electrical stability. These findings underscore the potential of post&#8208;perovskite semiconductors for advanced optoelectronic and radiation detection applications.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a minimum detection limit of 4.3&#160;nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The enhanced density also mitigates ionic migration, ensuring excellent electrical stability. These findings underscore the potential of post-perovskite semiconductors for advanced optoelectronic and radiation detection applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nonmetallic High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Engineered Nanocarbons for Advanced ORR Electrocatalysis</title>

B, F, P, S, and N co&#8208;doped high&#8208;entropy nanocarbon (HENC) is synthesized through ZIF&#8208;8 modification and pyrolysis. It exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction, rivaling Pt/C, and notable stability. Simulations highlight synergistic heteroatom effects and entropy enhancement, with N, P, and S as crucial active sites. In zinc&#8211;air batteries, HENC achieves a peak power density of 604 mW cm&#8722;2, surpassing Pt/C (542 mW cm&#8722;2), while maintaining durability. This study introduces a novel route for high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective catalysts.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials are poised to revolutionize materials science and industrial applications due to their design flexibility, peculiar performance, and broad applicability. In this study, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept high&#8208;entropy engineered nanocarbon (HENC) co&#8208;doped with five nonmetal elements (B, F, P, S, and N), synthesized via in situ polymerization modification of ZIF&#8208;8 followed by pyrolysis. The HENC exhibits outstanding performance as a nonmetal electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with activity on par with benchmark Pt/C electrocatalysts and superior cyclic stability. Simulations and all&#8208;site calculations reveal that the synergistic effects of abundant heteroatoms and increased system entropy facilitate the formation of *O2 species, with N, P, and S acting as the key active elements, while co&#8208;doping with B and F further enhances stability. Notably, HENCs have been validated as cathode catalysts in zinc&#8211;air batteries, achieving an impressive peak power density of 604 mW cm&#8722;2 and demonstrating long&#8208;term stability over a 16&#8208;day period, outpacing the commercial Pt/C catalyst (542 mW cm&#8722;2). This work not only enriches the concept of high entropy and advances the understanding of high&#8208;entropy materials but also opens a new avenue for the development of high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost catalysts.

         <title>Thiazolium&#8208;Linked Crystalline Porous Covalent Organic Frameworks for Mixed Electronic&#8208;Ionic Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

The new thiazolium&#8208;linked COFs (MEICOFs) were synthesized by a &#8220;pre&#8208;polymerization followed by self&#8208;ionization&#8221; approach with well crystallinity, and high chemical stability, where the ionic groups synthesized following the connection of building blocks. Ionic thiazolium linkage endow these MEICOFs with recorded electronic (55.2 S m&#8722;1) and well ionic conductivity, thereby enabling ORR catalysis without additional conductive agent and the rotation of electrode.








Abstract
Developing efficiently mixed electronic&#8208;ionic (MEI) conductive microcosmic pathways within a single functional material is essential yet challenging for electronic devices. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) feature pre&#8208;designed functionalities and uniform pores, making them highly desirable platforms for transporting electrons and ions. However, for MEI conductive COFs, achieving high crystallinity when incorporating high&#8208;density ionic groups within the extensively &#960;&#8208;electron delocalized skeletons remain a challenge due to intermolecular interactions. Herein, we reported a &#8220;pre&#8208;polymerization followed by self&#8208;ionization&#8221; approach to synthesize new thiazolium&#8208;linked COFs (MEICOFs, M&#9552;Cu, Co, Fe), where the ionic groups synthesized following the connection of building blocks. MEICOFs demonstrated broad ultraviolet&#8208;visible&#8208;near&#8208;infrared absorption bands and narrow bandgaps. As a proof of concept, the mixed electronic and hydroxide ionic conductivity of CuEICOF was determined to be 55.2 and 0.01 S m&#8722;1, respectively. Moreover, MEICOFs film could directly catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction without additional conductive agent and the rotation of the electrode.

         <title>Chiral Bimetallic Pt@Au Octapods with Spiral Four&#8208;Petal Flower&#8208;Like Symmetric Configuration as Sensitive SERS Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral bimetallic Pt@Au octapods with a g&#8208;factor of 0.026 at 724 nm have been fabricated, which endow the strong SERS signal due to the chiral selective enhancement of localized electromagnetic fields. Thus, an ultrasensitive detection method for the early clinical detection of AD is presented.








Abstract
Here, we synthesized chiral bimetallic Pt@Au octapods by using l/d&#8208;cysteine&#8211;threonine (CT) dipeptide as chiral ligands. These had a distinct spiral four&#8208;petal flower&#8208;like symmetric configuration with a twisted concave morphology on each facet. The twisted concave structure of the Pt@Au octapods facilitated intraparticle coupling, resulting in highly concentrated electric fields within the concave regions, thus creating &#8220;hot spots&#8221; that produced a potent surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect. The l&#8208;Pt@Au octapods showed a nearly twofold stronger SERS response to A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 monomers and fibrils than the d&#8208;Pt@Au octapods. The different association constants arose from the unique chiral recognition capabilities of the CT ligands on the surfaces of the l&#8208;Pt@Au octapods, which allowed them to form specific hydrogen bonds with A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 monomers and fibrils, producing significant differences in their Raman spectra. The data from clinical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples showed that the quantitative analysis of the A&#946;42/A&#946;40 ratio with Raman spectroscopy can be used as an effective biomarker for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a cut&#8208;off value of 0.085. Our results pave the way for the use of chiral nanomaterials with strong optical activities in the development of clinical testing instruments with biomedical applications.

         <title>Hybrid Linking Sites Constructed Non&#8208;Fully Conjugated Asymmetric Dimerized Giant Molecule Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells with an Efficiency of &#8776;20%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid linking site engineering was developed for the first time to construct nonfully conjugated asymmetric dimeric giant molecule acceptor (GMA) named 2Y&#8208;we, and the related organic solar cells achieved an efficiency of 19.9%, which is the highest value in the reported non&#8208;fully conjugated GMAs to date.








Abstract
Linking&#8208;site engineering, used to graft two or more monomers, is crucial for achieving high&#8208;performance Y&#8208;series giant molecule acceptors (Y&#8208;GMAs). However, the reported Y&#8208;GMAs all use a single&#8208;typed linking site, making it difficult to finely&#8208;tune their optoelectronic properties. Herein, we develop a non&#8208;fully conjugated Y&#8208;GMA (named 2Y&#8208;we), with hybrid linking sites at the wing and end&#8208;group of monomers, to combine the respective advantages of the wing and end&#8208;group site linked counterparts. Compared to its parental monomer, 2Y&#8208;we shows different intermolecular interactions, crystallinity, packing, and glass transition temperature, allowing optimized active layer morphology (including appropriate phase separation and ordered molecular packing) and stability. Consequently, the D18/2Y&#8208;we&#8208;based organic solar cells (OSCs) obtain an improved power&#8208;conversion&#8208;efficiency (PCE) of 17.4% with both higher open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC), due to the reduced energy loss and efficient exciton dissociation. Inspired by its high VOC&#160;&#215;&#160;JSC, 2Y&#8208;we is introduced into D18:L8&#8208;BO to fabricate ternary devices. Thanks to the further optimized morphology and improved charge transport, the ternary OSCs achieve a superior PCE of 19.9%, which is the highest value among the reported nonfully conjugated Y&#8208;GMAs. Our developed hybrid linking&#8208;site engineering for constructing high&#8208;performance Y&#8208;GMAs offers an approach to boost device efficiency.

&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) and short-circuit current density (&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;), due to the reduced energy loss and efficient exciton dissociation. Inspired by its high &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&#160;&lt;/sub&gt;&#215;&#160;&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;, 2Y-we is introduced into D18:L8-BO to fabricate ternary devices. Thanks to the further optimized morphology and improved charge transport, the ternary OSCs achieve a superior PCE of 19.9%, which is the highest value among the reported nonfully conjugated Y-GMAs. Our developed hybrid linking-site engineering for constructing high-performance Y-GMAs offers an approach to boost device efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
