      <title>A General Strategy for Hollow Metal&#8208;Phytate Coordination Complex Micropolyhedra Enabled by Cation Exchange</title>
      <dc:description>The ability to incorporate functional metal ions (M  n+  ) into metal&#8208;organic coordination complexes adds remarkable flexibility in the synthesis of multifunctional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with tailorable electronic, optical, and magnetic properties.

The attributes of the incoming M  n+  , namely Lewis acidity and ionic radius, determine not only the feasibility of achieving complete exchange of the parent Co  2+  ions but also the degree of morphological deformation of the resulting hollow micropolyhedra. New functions can be obtained for both completely and partially exchanged products, as supported by the observation of Ln  3+  (Ln  3+  = Tb  3+  , Eu  3+  , and Sm  3+  ) luminescence from the as&#8208;prepared hollow Ln  3+  &#8208;PA micropolyhedra after surface modification with dipicolinic acid as an antenna and by the achievement of new potential application of the resulting Fe  3+  &#8208; and Mn  2+  &#8208;PA polyhedral complexes as magnetic contrast agents. These advances allow one to use cation exchange to facilely synthesize multifunctional hollow M  n+  &#8208;PA micropolyhedra with an additional control of their physicochemical attributes, enabling exciting opportunities for them in biological and medical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>LaOCl&#8208;coupled polymeric carbon nitride for overall water splitting through a  one&#8208;photon excitation pathway</title>
      <dc:description>Sun&#8208;light driven water splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen gases in a large scale is a promising method for solar energy conversion. However, it is still a challenge to explore photocatalytic materials for overall water splitting due to the limited choice of a single semiconductor with suitable band energy levels (matching with water redox splitting potentials) while with minimized band gap for light harvesting. Here, we report a one&#8208;photon excitation pathway by coupling polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) with LaOCl semiconductor to achieve overall water splitting. This artificial photosynthesis composite catalyzes the decomposition of H2O into H2 and O2, with evolution rates of 22.3 and 10.7 &#956;mol h&#8208;1, respectively, outperforming most of the PCN&#8208;based materials. The high photocatalytic performance of PCN/LaOCl can be ascribed to the simultaneously accomplished reduction and oxidation of water on LaOCl and PCN domains, respectively, as well as the fast charge separation and migration induced by the interfacial electric field related to LaOCl modification. This study provides new insights on the development &#160;of composite photocatalysts for pure water splitting on the basis of polymer&#8208;based materials via charge modulation.</dc:description>

      <title>Tailoring Spectral and Photochemical Properties of Bio&#8208;inspired Retinal Mimics via in Silico Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>Controlling the spectral tunability and isomerization activity is currently one of the hot topics in the design of photo&#8208;reversible molecular switches for application in optoelectronic devices. The present work demonstrates how to manipulate the absorption of the retinal protonated Schiff base (rPSB) chromophore over the entire visible range by targeted functionalization of the retinal backbone. Moreover, we establish a correlation between the vertical excitation energy and the profile of the potential energy surface of the bright excited state responsible for the photoreactivity of rPSB. We exploited this correlation to rank the functionalized rPSB into different classes with characteristic photoisomerization activity. Eventually, the synergic effects of functionalization and of external electric fields in the few MV/cm range have been applied to achieve a reversable and regioselective control of the photoisomerization propensity of selected rPBS derivatives.</dc:description>

      <title>Posttranslational arginases provide a ribosomal route to non&#8208;proteinogenic ornithine residues in diverse peptide sequences</title>
      <dc:description>Ornithine is a component of many bioactive nonribosomal peptides but has been challenging to incorporate into ribosomal products. We recently identified OspR, a cyanobacterial arginase&#8208;like enzyme that installs ornithines in the antiviral ribosomally synthesised and posttranslationally modified peptide (RiPP) landornamide A. Here we report that OspR belongs to a larger family of peptide arginases from diverse organisms and RiPP types. In  E.&#160;coli  expressions, seven selected enzymes converted arginine residues to ornithines with little preference for the leader type. A diverse range of peptide sequences was modified, including polyarginine repeats. Further exploring the synthetic potential of OspR, we generated analogues of ornithine&#8208;containing nonribosomal peptides using RiPP technology. Five pseudo&#8208;nonribosomal products with ornithines at correct positions were obtained.

The wavelength, brightness, and stability are three crucial factors that determine the performance of a NIR&#8208;II fluorophore. Up to now, significant progress has been made in the development of NIR&#8208;II fluorescence molecular probes, including the synthesis of D&#8208;A&#8208;D and D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorophores with improved NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging performance and the construction of the off&#8208;on probe and ratiometric probe via energy transfer or molecular structure modification. In this Review, we summarize the most recent advances in molecular engineering design strategies of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores and probes, then highlight a selection of bioimaging and biosensing applications. We also provide perspectives on potential challenges and opportunities in this emerging field.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantiospecific solid solution formation triggers the propagation of homochirality</title>
      <dc:description>Propagation of homochirality plays a crucial role in the discussion on the origin of life. We here investigate the role of structurally related enantiopure additives in chiral symmetry breaking during reactive crystallizations. We demonstrate that a symmetry breaking process can be driven towards the same absolute configuration as the additive if this additive forms an enantiospecific solid solution with the racemate. We observe two antagonistic processes: enantiospecific growth inhibition directs symmetry breaking to the opposite enantiomer following &#8220;the rule of reversal&#8221; and enantiospecific solid solution formation that favors homochiral outcomes. During continuous grinding, contributions of solid solution formation override contributions of enantiospecific growth inhibition, directing the process towards the absolute configuration of the additive. Collectively, our findings offer a potential mechanism for propagation of homochirality.</dc:description>

Here, a carbazole&#8208;derived scaffold was used to isolate salts with a mono&#8208;coordinated silicon(II) cation, [RSi]+ (R = bulky carbazolyl substituent), by halide abstraction from a base&#8208;free halosilylene, RSiI, with the Ag[Al(O t BuF)4]. Despite the bulk of the carbazolyl moiety, the silylenylium cation [RSi]+ retains high reactivity. It was shown to react with an amine to form three bonds at the silicon atom in one reaction which conforms with the notion of a &#8220;supersilylene&#8221;. The resulting silylium cation [RSi(H)NR&#8217;2]+ (in the formal oxidation state SiIV) obtained by oxidative addition of an NH bond at [RSi]+ is even more acidic than the silylenylium cation (SiII) due to the absence of a lone pair of electrons the silicon atom.</dc:description>

      <title>Magnetic Levitation in Chemistry, Materials Science, and Biochemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
A density&#8208;based technique&#8212;magnetic levitation (MagLev)&#8212;developed and used to solve problems in the fields of chemistry, materials science, and biochemistry is described in this Review. MagLev has two principal characteristics: i)&#8197;it is density&#8208;based, and thus in principle applicable to all materials, and ii)&#8197;it is simple&#8212;a characteristic that makes it useful for a number of applications.







Abstract
All matter has density. The recorded uses of density to characterize matter date back to as early as ca. 250 BC, when Archimedes was believed to have solved &#8220;The Puzzle of The King's Crown&#8221; using density.[1] Today, measurements of density are used to separate and characterize a range of materials (including cells and organisms), and their chemical and/or physical changes in time and space. This Review describes a density&#8208;based technique&#8212;magnetic levitation (which we call &#8220;MagLev&#8221; for simplicity)&#8212;developed and used to solve problems in the fields of chemistry, materials science, and biochemistry. MagLev has two principal characteristics&#8212;simplicity, and applicability to a wide range of materials&#8212;that make it useful for a number of applications (for example, characterization of materials, quality control of manufactured plastic parts, self&#8208;assembly of objects in 3D, separation of different types of biological cells, and bioanalyses). Its simplicity and breadth of applications also enable its use in low&#8208;resource settings (for example&#8212;in economically developing regions&#8212;in evaluating water/food quality, and in diagnosing disease).

      <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Hyperpolarization of Gases</title>
      <dc:description>
PHIP and SABRE: This Minireview gives a selective overview of two hyperpolarization techniques: ParaHydrogen Induced Polarization (PHIP) and Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) in the context of production of hyperpolarized gases for potential applications in bioimaging and beyond.







Abstract
Imaging of gases is a major challenge for any modality including MRI. NMR and MRI signals are directly proportional to the nuclear spin density and the degree of alignment of nuclear spins with applied static magnetic field, which is called nuclear spin polarization. The level of nuclear spin polarization is typically very low, i.e., one hundred thousandth of the potential maximum at 1.5&#8201;T and a physiologically relevant temperature. As a result, MRI typically focusses on imaging highly concentrated tissue water. Hyperpolarization methods transiently increase nuclear spin polarizations up to unity, yielding corresponding gains in MRI signal level of several orders of magnitude that enable the 3D imaging of dilute biomolecules including gases. Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization is a fast, highly scalable, and low&#8208;cost hyperpolarization technique. The focus of this Minireview is to highlight selected advances in the field of parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization for the production of hyperpolarized compounds, which can be potentially employed as inhalable contrast agents.

The level of nuclear spin polarization is typically very low, i.e., one hundred thousandth of the potential maximum at 1.5&#8201;T and a physiologically relevant temperature. As a result, MRI typically focusses on imaging highly concentrated tissue water. Hyperpolarization methods transiently increase nuclear spin polarizations up to unity, yielding corresponding gains in MRI signal level of several orders of magnitude that enable the 3D imaging of dilute biomolecules including gases. Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization is a fast, highly scalable, and low&#8208;cost hyperpolarization technique. The focus of this Minireview is to highlight selected advances in the field of parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization for the production of hyperpolarized compounds, which can be potentially employed as inhalable contrast agents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Food&#8208;Poisoning Bacteria Employ a Citrate Synthase and a Type II NRPS to Synthesize Bolaamphiphilic Lipopeptide Antibiotics</title>
      <dc:description>Mining the genome of the food&#8208;spoiling bacterium  Burkholderia gladioli  pv.  cocovenenans  revealed five non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene clusters, including an orphan gene locus (  bol  ). Gene inactivation and metabolic profiling linked the  bol  gene cluster to novel bolaamphiphilic lipopeptides with antimycobacterial activity. A combination of chemical analyses and bioinformatics elucidated the structures of bolagladin A and B, lipocyclopeptides featuring an unusual dehydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;alanine enamide linker fused to an unprecedented tricarboxylic fatty acid tail. Through a series of targeted gene deletions we proved the involvement of a designated citrate synthase (CS), priming ketosynthases (KS III), a type II NRPS including a novel desaturase for enamide formation, and a multimodular NRPS generating the cyclopeptide. Network analyses revealed the evolutionary origin of the CS and identified cryptic CS/NRPS gene loci in various bacterial genomes.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Two  Burkholderia gladioli  strains isolated from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients were found to produce unusual lipodepsipeptides containing a unique citrate&#8208;derived fatty acid and a rare dehydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;alanine residue.

      <title>Hydroxamic Acids Immobilized on Resins (HAIRs): A Toolbox for the Synthesis of Dual&#8208;Targeting HDAC Inhibitors and HDAC Degraders (PROTACs)</title>
      <dc:description>Inhibition of more than one cancer&#8208;related pathway by multi&#8208;target agents is an emerging approach in modern anticancer drug discovery. Here, based on the well&#8208;established synergy between histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and alkylating agents, we present the discovery of a series of alkylating HDACi using a pharmacophore&#8208;linking strategy. For the parallel synthesis of the target compounds, we developed an efficient solid&#8208;phase supported protocol using hydroxamic acids immobilized on resins (HAIRs) as stable and versatile building blocks for the preparation of functionalized HDACi. The most promising compound, 3n, was significantly more active in apoptosis induction, activation of caspase 3/7, and formation of DNA damage (&#947;&#8208;H2AX) than the sum of the activities of either active principle alone. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of our preloaded resins, the HAIR approach was successfully extended to the synthesis of a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC), which efficiently degrades histone deacetylases.</dc:description>

Herein we report a Cu  II  &#8208;responsive DNAzyme rationally designed by incorporating one of the most stabilizing artificial metallo&#8208;base pairs, a Cu  II  &#8208;mediated carboxyimidazole base pair (  Im  C  &#8211;Cu  II  &#8211;  Im  C  ), into a known RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme. Cleavage of the substrate was suppressed without Cu  II  , but the reaction proceeded efficiently in the presence of Cu  II  ions. This is due to the induction of a catalytically active structure by  Im  C  &#8211;Cu  II  &#8211;  Im  C  pairing. The on&#8211;off ratio was as high as 12&#8208;fold, which far exceeds that of the previous DNAzyme having a Cu  II  &#8208;mediated hydroxypyridone base pair. The DNAzyme activity was regulated in response specifically to Cu  II  ions during the reaction via addition, removal, and reduction of Cu  II  . This approach would advance the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA systems with a sharp switching function.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective Transfer Semihydrogenation of Alkynes with H2O (D2O) as the H (D) Source over a Pd&#8208;P Cathode</title>
      <dc:description>Developing a facile controllable avenue to selective semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes with a defined configuration using a cheap and safe hydrogen donor is highly desirable, but remains a big challenge. Here, we reported a selective semihydrogenation (deuteration) of numerous terminal and internal alkynes using H  2  O (D  2  O) as the H (D) source over a Pd&#8208;P alloy cathode at a lower potential. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that the doping of P caused the enhanced specific adsorption of alkynes and the promoted intrinsic activity for producing adsorbed atomic hydrogen (H*  ads  ) from water electrolysis. The semihydrogenation of alkynes could be accomplished at a lower potential with up to 99% selectivity and 78% Faraday efficiency of alkene products, outperforming pure Pd and commercial Pd/C. This electrochemical semihydrogenation of alkynes might proceed via a H*  ads  addition pathway rather than a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. The decreased amount of H  ads  at lower potential and the more preferential adsorption of the Pd&#8208;P to C&#8801;C &#960; bond than C=C moiety resulted in the excellent alkene selectivity. The thermodynamically unstable but synthetically significant  Z  &#8208;alkenes with &gt; 99%  Z  selectivity were expediently accessed. This method is capable of producing the synthetically more useful but highly challenged mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;deuterated alkenes with up to 99% deuterium incorporation. The paired production of crucial industrial feedstock adiponitrile at anode and alkene at the cathode in a Pd&#8208;P || NiSe two&#8208;electrode system demonstrated its promising potential.</dc:description>

Physical separations can be superior to chemical separations when it comes to energetics and kinetics, especially when ideal sieving is feasible among hard&#8208;to&#8208;separate gas mixtures.

&lt;p&gt;Physical separations can be superior to chemical separations when it comes to energetics and kinetics, especially when ideal sieving is feasible among hard&#8208;to&#8208;separate gas mixtures. Unfortunately, for industrial gases a very precise pore window size which must be ultramicroporous is needed for ideal sieving. In their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.20200641410.1002/anie.202006414&lt;/a&gt;), Y. Huang, M.&#8197;J.

      <title>How far does energy migrate in DNA and cause damage? Evidence for long&#8208;range photodamage to DNA</title>
      <dc:description>A new DNA architecture addresses the question, how far energy migrates in DNA and forms cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) as photodamages causing skin cancer. The 3&#8208;methoxyxanthone nucleoside allows site&#8208;selective photoenergy injection into DNA. The designated CPD site lacks the phosphodiester bond and can be placed in defined distances. The CPD formation links two oligonucleotides together and allows probing by gel electrophoresis. We obtained a sigmoidal distance dependence with R  0  of 25&#177;3 &#197;. Below R  0  , short&#8208;range energy migration occurs with high CPD yields and shallow distance dependence, characteristic for a coherent process. 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;C as epigenetic modification on the 3&#8217;&#8208;side facilitates CPD formation. Above R  0  , long&#8208;range incoherent energy migration occurs over 30 A&#8208;T pairs (105.4 &#197;). The evidence of long&#8208;range CPD formation is fundamental for our understanding of DNA photodamaging.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Previously described Lewis superacids are moisture sensitive and predominantly hard in character &#8211; features that are severely limiting their widespread use in orbital controlled reactions and under non&#8208;inert conditions. Herein, we describe adducts of bis(perchlorocatecholato)germane, the first hard and soft Lewis superacid based on germanium. Remarkably, the synthesis of this compound is performed in water, and the obtained H  2  O&#8208;adduct constitutes a strong Br&#248;nsted acid. If applied as adduct with aprotic donors, it displays excellent activity in a diverse set of Lewis acid catalyzed transformations, covering hydrosilylation, hydrodefluorination, transfer hydrogenation, and carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis. Given the very straightforward synthetic access from two commercially available precursors, the unlimited water stability and the soft Lewis acidic character, it promotes the transfer of Lewis superacidity into organic synthesis and materials science.</dc:description>

      <title>The Nature of Strong Chalcogen Bonds Involving Chalcogen&#8208;Containing Heterocycles</title>
      <dc:description>Chalcogen bonds are &#963; hole interactions and have been used in recent years as an alternative to hydrogen bonds. In general, the electrostatic potential at the chalcogen atom and orbital delocalization effects are made responsible for the orientation of the chalcogen bond. Here, we were able to show by means of SAPT calculations that neither the induction (orbital delocalization effects) nor the electrostatic term is causing the spatial orientation of strong chalcogen bonds in tellurium&#8208;containing aromatics. Instead, steric interactions (Pauli repulsion) are responsible for the orientation. Against chemical intuition the dispersion energies of the examined tellurium&#8208;containing aromatics are far less important for the net attractive forces compared to the energies in the corresponding sulfur and selenium compounds. Our results underline the importance of often overlooked steric interactions (Pauli repulsion) in conformational control of &#963; hole interactions.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Many inorganic materials can form crystals but little is known about their enantioselective crystallization. In this article, we report on the enantioselective crystallization of &#949;&#8208;Zn(OH)  2  (Wulfingite) chiral crystals using amino acids. Crystals of &#949;&#8208;Zn(OH)  2  were crystallized from supersaturated sodium&#8208;hydroxide and zinc&#8208;nitrate aqueous solutions in the presence of L&#8208; or D&#8208;Arginine. All our chiral measurements, such as selective chiral adsorption by circular dichroisem (CD) /chiral chromatography and polarimetry measurements, clearly show chiral discrimination during the crystallization of &#949;&#8208;Zn(OH)  2  . In addition, we have developed a new method for identifying chirality in crystals using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Although the values of chiral induction of the &#949;&#8208;Zn(OH)  2  crystals we obtained are somewhat low, they are still significant since they demonstrate that enantioselectivity during crystallization of chiral inorganic crystals with chiral additives can be achieved. The method is quite general and can be applied to many chiral inorganic systems. Understanding and controlling the crystallization of chiral inorganic crystals is of importance for gaining knowledge on the interaction of chiral molecules with inorganic surfaces. This can lead to understanding basic scientific questions such as the evolution of homochirality in biomolecules and developing chiral inorganic crystals for a variety of purposes such as asymmetric catalysis, optical applications and more.</dc:description>

      <title>Disulfide&#8208;linked allosteric modulators for multi&#8208;cycle kinetic control of DNA&#8208;based nanodevices</title>
      <dc:description>Nature employs sulfur switches, i.e. redox&#8208;active disulfides, to kinetically control biological pathways in a highly efficient and reversible way. Inspired by this mechanism we describe here a DNA&#8208;based synthetic nanodevice that acts as a sulfur switch and can be temporally controlled though redox regulation. To do this we rationally designed disulfide DNA strands (modulators) that hybridize to a ligand&#8208;binding DNA nanodevice and act as redox&#8208;active allosteric regulators inducing the nanodevice to release or load its ligand. Upon reduction, the allosteric modulator spontaneously de&#8208;hybridizes from the nanodevice and, as a result, its effect is transient. The system is reversible and has an unprecedented high tolerance to waste products and displays transient behavior for over 40 cycles without significant loss of efficiency. Kinetic control of DNA&#8208;based ligand&#8208;binding nanodevices through purely chemical reactions paves the way for temporal regulation of more complex chemical pathways.</dc:description>

      <title>Zeolite&#8208;Encaged Pd&#8208;Mn Nanocatalysts for CO2 Hydrogenation and Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
      <dc:description>CO2&#8208;mediated hydrogen storage energy cycle is a promising way to implement the hydrogen economy, but the exploration of efficient catalysts to achieve this process remains challenging. Herein, sub&#8208;nanometer Pd&#8208;Mn clusters were encaged within silicalite&#8208;1 (S&#8208;1) zeolites by a ligand&#8208;protected method under direct hydrothermal conditions. The obtained zeolite&#8208;encaged metallic nanocatalysts exhibited extraordinary catalytic activity and durability in both CO2 hydrogenation into formate and formic acid (FA) dehydrogenation back to CO2 and hydrogen. Thanks to the formation of ultrasmall metal clusters and the synergic effect of bi&#8208;metallic components, the PdMn0.6@S&#8208;1 catalyst afforded a formate generation rate of 2151 molformate molPd&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 at 353 K, and an initial turnover frequency of 6860 molH2 molPd&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for CO&#8208;free FA decomposition at 333 K without any additive. Both values represent the top levels among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art heterogeneous catalysts under similar conditions. This work demonstrates that zeolite&#8208;encaged metallic catalysts hold great promise to realize CO2&#8208;mediated hydrogen energy cycles in the future featuring fast charging and releasing kinetics.</dc:description>

      <title>Total Synthesis of Zephycarinatines via Photocatalytic Reductive Radical ipso&#8208;Cyclization</title>
      <dc:description>We report herein a nonbiomimetic strategy for the total synthesis of the plicamine&#8208;type alkaloids, zephycarinatines C and D. The key feature of the synthesis was the stereoselective reductive radical  ipso&#8208;cyclization using visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis. This cyclization enabled the construction of a 6,6&#8208;spirocyclic core structure by the addition of the carbon&#8208;centered radical onto the aromatic ring. The biological evaluation of zephycarinatines and their derivatives revealed that the synthetic derivative having a keto group displayed moderate inhibitory activity against LPS&#8208;induced NO production.

      <title>Hydrogen bonding enhances the electrochemical hydrogenation of benzaldehyde in the aqueous phase</title>
      <dc:description>The hydrogenation of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol on carbon&#8208;supported metals in water, enabled by an external potential, is markedly promoted by polarization of the functional groups. The presence of polar co&#8208;adsorbates such as substituted phenols enhances the hydrogenation rate of the aldehyde via two effects&#8211;polarizing the carbonyl group and increasing the probability of forming a transition state for H addition. These two effects enable a hydrogenation route, in which phenol acts as a conduit for proton addition, with a higher rate than the direct proton transfer from hydronium ions. The fast hydrogenation enabled by the presence of phenol and applied potential overcompensates for the decrease in coverage of benzaldehyde caused by competitive adsorption. A higher acid strength of the co&#8208;adsorbate increases the intensity of interactions and the rates of selective carbonyl reduction.</dc:description>

These two effects enable a hydrogenation route, in which phenol acts as a conduit for proton addition, with a higher rate than the direct proton transfer from hydronium ions. The fast hydrogenation enabled by the presence of phenol and applied potential overcompensates for the decrease in coverage of benzaldehyde caused by competitive adsorption. A higher acid strength of the co&#8208;adsorbate increases the intensity of interactions and the rates of selective carbonyl reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Desymmetrized Vertex Design toward a Molecular Cage with Unusual Topology</title>
      <dc:description>A novel low&#8208;symmetry organic molecular cage with distinctive geometry was successfully synthesized from 5,5'&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(2&#8208;hydroxyisophthalaldehyde) and 1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine building blocks, through the desymmetrized vertex design strategy. Single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis shows that the cage contains asymmetrical and nonplanar windows, exhibiting an unprecedented C2 symmetry and an efficient packing. The molecular cage structure was also characterized by FT&#8208;IR, NMR, MALDI&#8208;TOF, and POM. Quantum chemistry studies show that the cage structure contains rare intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen (C&#8211;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H&#8211;C) bonding interactions. The cage crystals exhibit high iodine vapor uptake (3.78 g&#183;g&#8210;1), which is among the highest for porous molecular materials. The knowledge gained in this study would open new possibilities for the design and synthesis of molecular cages with novel topologies targeting a broad range of applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Determinants for Fusion Speed of Biomolecular Droplets</title>
      <dc:description>Biomolecular droplets formed through phase separation have a tendency to fuse.

Using a dual&#8208;trap optical tweezers setup, we found the fusion speeds of four types of droplets to differ by two orders of magnitude. The order of fusion speed correlates with the fluorescence of thioflavin T, which in turn reflects the macromolecular packing density inside droplets.

      <title>Fluorination Chemistry Enhances NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence of Polymer Dots for Quantitative Brain Tumor Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorescent probes in the second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II, 1000~1700 nm) have resulted in unprecedented imaging performance. Here, we describe a fluorination strategy in semiconducting polymers for development of highly bright NIR&#8208;II probes. Notably, tetrafluorination yielded a fluorescence QY of 3.2% for the polymer dots (Pdots), over 3&#8208;fold enhancement as compared to non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts. The fluorescence enhancement was attributable to nanoscale fluorous effect in the Pdots that maintained the molecular planarity and minimized the structure distortion between the excited state and ground state, thus reducing the nonradiative relaxations. Followed by through&#8208;skull and through&#8208;scalp imaging of the brain vasculature of live mice, we quantitatively analyzed the vascular morphology of transgenic brain tumors in terms of the vessel lengths, vessel branches, and vessel symmetry, which showed statistically significant differences from the wild type animals.

      <title>Anisotropic Gas Separation in Oriented ZIF&#8208;95 Membranes Prepared by Vapor&#8208;Assisted In&#8208;Plane Epitaxial Growth</title>
      <dc:description>Control of the microstructure like grain orientation, grain boundaries and thickness are crucial for MOF membranes. In the present work, we develop a novel synthesis strategy to prepare highly c&#8208;oriented ZIF&#8208;95 membranes through vapor&#8208;assisted in&#8208;plane epitaxial growth. In a mixed DMF/water vapor atmosphere, in&#8208;plane epitaxial growth of a ZIF&#8208;95 seeds layer is achieved to obtain an oriented and well&#8208;intergrown ZIF&#8208;95 membrane with a thickness of only 600 nm. Demonstrated by both experimental and simulation studies, the c&#8208;oriented ZIF&#8208;95 membrane displays superior separation performances since a perfectly oriented structure results in a notable reduction of inter&#8208;crystalline defects and transport pathways. For the separation of equimolar binary mixtures at 100 &#176;C and 1 bar, the mixture separation factors of H  2  /CO  2  and H  2  /CH  4  are 32.2 and 53.7, respectively, with H  2  permeance of over 7.9 x 10  &#8208;7  mol&#183;m  &#8208;2  &#183;s  &#8208;1  &#183;Pa  &#8208;1  , which is 4.6 times higher than that of a randomly oriented ZIF&#8208;95 membrane.</dc:description>

For the separation of equimolar binary mixtures at 100 &#176;C and 1 bar, the mixture separation factors of H  2  /CO  2  and H  2  /CH  4  are 32.2 and 53.7, respectively, with H  2  permeance of over 7.9 x 10  &#8208;7  mol&#183;m  &#8208;2  &#183;s  &#8208;1  &#183;Pa  &#8208;1  , which is 4.6 times higher than that of a randomly oriented ZIF&#8208;95 membrane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Reverse Thinking of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Principle: Amplifying Molecular Motions to Boost Photothermal Efficiency of Nanofibers</title>
      <dc:description>Development of efficient photothermal nanofibers is of vital importance, but remaining a big challenge. Herein, with reverse thinking of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) principle, we demonstrate an ingenious and universal protocol for amplifying molecular motions to boost photothermal efficiency of nanofibers. Core&#8208;shell nanofibers having the olive oil solution of AIE&#8208;active molecules as the core surrounded by PVDF&#8208;HFP shell were constructed by coaxial electrospinning. The molecularly dissolved state of AIE&#8208;active molecules allows them to freely rotate and/or vibrate in nanofibers upon photoexcitation and thus significantly elevates the proportion of non&#8208;radiative energy dissipation, affording impressive heat&#8208;generating efficiency. Photothermal evaluation shows that the core&#8208;shell nanofibers with excellent durability can reach up to 22.36% of photothermal conversion efficiency, which is 26&#8208;fold as the non&#8208;core&#8208;shell counterpart. Noticeably, such core&#8208;shell nanofiber can be used for photothermal textiles and solar steam generation induced by natural sunlight with green and carbon&#8208;zero emission.</dc:description>

      <title>Photoassisted Selective Steam and Dry Reforming of Methane to Syngas Catalyzed by Rhodium&#8208;Vanadium Bimetallic Oxide Cluster Anions at Room Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>The use of photo&#8208;energy represents a promising strategy driving endothermic steam (water) reforming and dry (carbon dioxide) reforming of methane (SRM and DRM) to syngas under mild conditions, but it remains a serious challenge of low syngas selectivity. The precise control of each elementary reaction and acquisition of the crucial step at which photo&#8208;irradiation should be applied are indispensable for engineering the product selectivity. Herein, photoassisted SRM and DRM reactions at room temperature with high syngas selectivity have been successfully achieved in the gas phase catalysis for the first time. The catalysts used are bimetallic rhodium&#8208;vanadium oxide cluster anions of Rh2VO1&#8722;3&#8722;  . Both the oxidation of methane and reduction of H2O/CO2  can take place efficiently in the dark while the pivotal step to govern syngas selectivity is photo&#8208;excitation of the reaction intermediates Rh2  VO2,3CH2&#8722;  to specific electronically excited states that can selectively produce CO and H2  . The important process of electronic excitation over Rh2  VO2,3CH2&#8722;  to control the syngas selectivity is further confirmed from the comparison with the thermal excitation of Rh2VO2,3CH2  &#8722;  , which leads to diversity of products. The atomic&#8208;level mechanism obtained from the well&#8208;controlled cluster reactions provides a new insight into the process of selective syngas production from the photocatalytic SRM and DRM reactions over the catalysts of supported metal oxides.</dc:description>

      <title>Adaptive Bifunctional Electrocatalyst of Amorphous CoFe Oxide @ 2D Black Phosphorus for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>Water electrolysis offers a promising green technology to tackle the global energy and environmental crisis, but its efficiency is greatly limited by the sluggish reaction kinetics of both the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, by growing amorphous multi&#8208;transition&#8208;metal (cobalt and iron) oxide on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP), we develop a bifunctional electrocatalyst (CoFeO@BP), which is able to efficiently catalyze both HER and OER. The overpotentials for the hybrid CoFeO@BP catalyst to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm  2  in 1 M KOH are 88 and 266 mV for HER and OER, respectively. Based on a series of ex&#8208;situ and in&#8208;situ investigations, the excellent catalytic performance of CoFeO@BP is found to result from the adaptive surface structure under reduction and oxidation potentials. Benefitted from the metastability of amorphous cobalt iron oxide and its strong affinity with BP, CoFeO@BP can be transformed to CoFe phosphide under reduction potential, in&#8208;situ generating the real active catalyst for HER. While under oxidation potential, the oxygen vacancy rich amorphous cobalt iron oxide on BP tends to catalyze OER following the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), which kinetically facilitates OER catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal&#8208;sulfur linkages achieved by organic tethering of Ru nanocrystals for enhanced electrochemical nitrogen reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrogen reduction (NRR) is a clean, facile, and sustainable approach towards ammonia (NH  3  ) production at ambient conditions. However, the inert nature of nitrogen and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) command it towards sluggish kinetics and poor selectivity. Inspired by the metal&#8208;sulfur (M&#8208;S) linkages in the nitrogenase enzyme, here we show a surface modification strategy to modulate the electronic structure and improve the N  2  availability on the catalytic surface, which suppresses the HER and synergistically improved the rate of NH  3  production. Thus, ruthenium nanocrystals anchored on reduced graphene oxide (Ru/rGO) are modified with different aliphatic thiols to achieve M&#8208;S linkages. A high faradaic efficiency (11%) with an improved NH  3  yield (50 &#181;g h  &#8208;1  mg  &#8208;1  ) is achieved at &#8208;0.1 V vs RHE in acidic conditions by using dodecanethiol. DFT calculations reveal intermediate N  2  adsorption and desorption of the product is achieved by electronic structure modification along with the suppression of the HER by surface modification. The modified catalyst exerts excellent stability and recyclability for NH  3  production, as confirmed by rigorous control experiments including the  15  N isotope labeling experiments.</dc:description>

      <title>Removing Formaldehyde&#8208;Induced Peptidyl Crosslinks Enables Mass Spectrometry Imaging of Peptide Hormone Distributions from Formalin&#8208;Fixed Paraffin&#8208;Embedded Tissues</title>
      <dc:description>Linking molecular and chemical changes to human disease states depends on the availability of appropriate clinical samples, mostly preserved as formalin&#8208;fixed paraffin&#8208;embedded (FFPE) specimens stored in tissue banks. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is an established technique that enables visualization of the spatiotemporal distribution of molecules in biological samples. However, MSI is not effective for imaging FFPE tissues because of the chemical modifications of analytes, including complex crosslinking between nucleophilic moieties. Here we used an MS&#8208;compatible inorganic nucleophile, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, to chemically reverse inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;crosslinks from endogenous molecules. The analyte restoration appears specific for formaldehyde&#8208;reactive amino acid residues. This approach enabled the MSI&#8208;assisted localization of pancreatic peptides expressed in the alpha, beta, and gamma cells. Pancreatic islet&#8208;like distributions of islet hormones were observed in human FFPE tissues preserved for more than five years, demonstrating that the rich repertoire of samples from biobanks can effectively be investigated with MSI.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We introduce color&#8208;shifting fluorophores which reversibly switch between a green and red fluorescent form via an intramolecular spirocyclization. The equilibrium of spirocyclization is environmentally sensitive and can be directly measured by determining the ratio of red to green fluorescence, allowing the generation of ratiometric fluorescent probes and biosensors. Specifically, we develop a ratiometric biosensor for imaging calcium ions (Ca  2+  ) in living cells, ratiometric probes for different proteins and a bioassay for the quantification of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate.</dc:description>

      <title>Singlet heterofission in tetracene&#8208;pentacene thin&#8208;film blends</title>
      <dc:description>Heterofission, the photophysical process converting an excited singlet state into two triplets on chemically distinct chromophores, offers great potential for a tuning of the optical bandgap and the splitting between singlet and triplet energies, with both fundamental and applied interest. Here, we report the time&#8208;domain observation of heterofission in mixed thin films of the prototypical singlet fission chromophores pentacene and tetracene using excitation wavelengths above and below the tetracene bandgap. We find a time constant of 26 ps for endothermic heterofission of a singlet exciton on pentacene in blends with low pentacene fractions, which is outcompeted by pentacene homofission for increasing pentacene concentrations. Direct excitation of tetracene leads to fast energy transfer to pentacene and subsequent singlet fission which prevents homofission or heterofission of a singlet exciton on tetracene.</dc:description>

      <title>Elucidating Zeolite Channel Geometry&#8208;Reaction Intermediates Relationships during the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbons Process</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical industry has exploited zeolite shape selectivity for more than 50 years, yet our fundamental understanding remains still limited. Herein, the zeolite channel geometry&#8208;reactive intermediates relationships have been studied in detail over anisotropic zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 crystals during the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH) process, using advanced magic angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy. The utilization of anisotropic crystals enabled the preferential formation of reactive intermediates in single oriented zeolite channels, as revealed by molecular dynamics simulations and  in&#8208;situ  UV&#8208;Vis diffuse&#8208;reflectance spectroscopy. The ssNMR results show that the slightly more rigid sinusoidal zeolite channels favor the olefin cycle by promoting the homologation of alkanes, while the extended straight zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 channels foster the aromatic cycle with a higher degree of alkylation of aromatics. Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments further indicate the preferential formation of heavy aromatics at the sinusoidal channel dominated surface, providing further insights into catalyst deactivation.</dc:description>
