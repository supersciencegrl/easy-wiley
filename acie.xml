         <title>Recent Advances in Oral and Transdermal Protein Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein and peptide drugs are predominantly administered by injection to achieve high bioavailability, but this greatly compromises patient compliance. Oral and transdermal drug delivery with minimal invasiveness and high adherence represent attractive alternatives to injection administration. However, oral and transdermal administration of bioactive proteins must overcome biological barriers, namely the gastrointestinal and skin barriers, respectively. The rapid development of new materials and technologies promises to address these physiological obstacles. This review provides an overview of the latest advances in oral and transdermal protein delivery, including chemical strategies, synthetic nanoparticles, medical microdevices, and biomimetic systems for oral administration, as well as chemical enhancers, physical approaches, and microneedles in transdermal delivery. We also discuss challenges and future perspectives of the field with a focus on innovation and translation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoenzymatic Strategy for&#160; Radical&#8208;mediated Stereoselective Hydroalkylation with Diazo Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbene insertion reactions initiated with diazo compounds have been widely used to develop unnatural enzymatic reactions. However, the alternative functionalization of diazo compounds in enzymatic processes has been unexploited. Herein, we developed a photoenzymatic strategy for the radical&#8208;mediated stereoselective hydroalkylation with diazo compounds. This method generates carbon&#8208;centered radicals via an ene&#8208;reductase catalyzed photoinduced electron transfer process from diazo compounds, enabling the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;chiral carbonyl compounds in good yields and stereoselectivities. This work further expands the reaction patterns in photo&#8208;biocatalysis and offers a new approach to solving the selectivity challenges of radical&#8208;mediated reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Positioning of Metal Ions to Stabilize Open Tin Sites in Beta Zeolite for Catalytic Conversion of Sugars</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Via hydrothermal synthesis of Sn&#8208;Al gels, mild dealumination and ion exchange, a bimetallic Sn&#8208;Ni&#8208;Beta catalyst was prepared which can convert glucose to methyl lactate (MLA) and methyl vinyl glycolate (MVG) in methanol at yields of 71.2% and 10.2%, respectively. Results from solid&#8208;state MAS NMR, XPS, TEM, spectroscopic analysis, probe&#8208;TPD, and DFT calculations conclusively reveal that the openness of the Sn sites, such as by the formation of [(SiO)3&#8208;Sn&#8208;OH] entities, is governed by an adjacent metal cation such as Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+. This relies on the low structure&#8208;defective pore channel, provided by the current synthesis scheme, and the specific silica hydroxyl anchor point is associated with the incorporation of Sn for additional and precise metal ion localization. The presence of metal cations significantly improved the catalytic performance of Sn&#8208;Ni&#8208;Beta for glucose isomerization and conversion to MLA of sugar compared with Sn&#8208;Beta.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Photo&#8208;Crosslinking and Photo&#8208;Sensitizing Properties for Synthetic Fluorescent Protein Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike previous works reporting on their fluorescence applications, this work discovered that fluorescence protein chromophore analogs can undergo triplet excited state, enabling photo&#8208;crosslinking and photo&#8208;sensitizing chemistries. Exploration of these synthetic fluorescent protein chromophores resulted in photo&#8208;crosslinkers for biomolecules, photo&#8208;catalysts for organic reactions, and photosensitizers for chromophore&#8208;assisted light inactivation and photodynamic therapies.







Abstract
Synthetic fluorescent protein chromophores have been reported for their singlet state fluorescence properties and applications in bioimaging, but rarely for the triplet state chemistries. Herein, we enabled their photo&#8208;sensitizing and photo&#8208;crosslinking properties through rational modulations. Extension of molecular conjugation and introduction of heavy atoms promoted the generation of reactive oxygen species. Unlike other photosensitizers, these chromophores selectively photo&#8208;crosslinked aggregated proteins and uncovered the interactome profiles. We also exemplified their general applications in chromophore&#8208;assisted light inactivation, photodynamic therapy and photo induced polymerization. Theoretical calculation, pathway analysis and transient absorption spectroscopy provided mechanistic insights for this triplet state chemistry. Overall, this work expands the function and application of synthetic fluorescent protein chromophores by enabling their triplet excited state properties.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Nanoconfinement Effect on Nanoreactor via Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoconfinement in mesoporous nanoarchitectures could dramatically change molecular transport and reaction kinetics during electrochemical process. A molecular&#8208;level understanding of nanoconfinement and mass transport is critical for the applications, but a proper route to study it is lacking. Herein, we develop a single nanoreactor electrochemiluminescence (SNECL) microscopy based on Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticle to directly visualize in situ nanoconfinement&#8208;enhanced electrochemical reactions at the single molecule level. Meanwhile, mass transport capability of single nanoreactor, reflected as long decay time and recovery ability, is monitored and simulated with a high spatial resolution. The nanoconfinement effects in our system also enable imaging single proteins on cellular membrane. Our SNECL approach may pave the way to decipher the nanoconfinement effects during electrochemical process, and build bridges between mesoporous nanoarchitectures and potential electrochemical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoinduced, Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction for the Stereoselective Assembly of C&#8208;Linked Glycosides and Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel catalyst mediated the union of glycosyl halides and redox&#8208;active derivatives of carboxylic acids and amines to deliver C&#8208;alkyl glycosides diastereoselectively under photoinduced conditions. This cross&#8208;coupling reaction of glycosyl nickel species with alkyl radicals generated by visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted fragmentation of EDA complexes is amenable to the late&#8208;stage glycosylation of complex bioactive molecules and oligopeptides.







Abstract
C&#8208;Alkyl glycosides and glycoproteins exist in natural products and are prized for their role as carbohydrate mimics in drug design. However, a practical strategy that merges glycosyl donors with readily accessible reagents, derived from abundant carboxylic acid and amine feedstocks, is yet to be conceived. Herein, we show that a nickel catalyst promotes C&#8722;C coupling between glycosyl halides and aliphatic acids or primary amines (converted into redox&#8208;active electrophiles in one step), in the presence of Hantzsch ester and LiI (or Et3N) under blue LED illumination to deliver C&#8208;alkyl glycosides with high diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies support the photoinduced formation of alkyl radicals that react with a glycosyl nickel species generated in situ to facilitate cross&#8208;coupling. Through this manifold, innate CO2H and NH2 motifs embedded within amino acids and oligopeptides are selectively capped and functionalized to afford glycopeptide conjugates through late&#8208;stage glycosylation.

         <title>Aptamer Inhibits Tumor Growth by Leveraging Cellular Proteasomal Degradation System to Degrade c&#8208;Met in Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new mechanism where aptamer leverages cellular proteasomal degradation system to degrade protein for cancer treatment. A DNA aptamer binds to extracellular domain of mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition factor (c&#8208;Met), and induces c&#8208;Met phosphorylation at Y1003 and Y1349. The phosphorylation of Y1003 recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase casitas B&#8208;lineage lymphoma (c&#8208;cbl), which causes c&#8208;Met ubiquitination and degradation in proteasome.







Abstract
Current action mechanisms for aptamer&#8208;based therapeutics depend on occupancy&#8208;driven pharmacology to mediate protein functions. We report a new mechanism where aptamers leverage cellular proteasomal degradation system to degrade proteins for cancer treatment. A DNA aptamer (hereinafter referred to as c&#8208;Met&#8208;Ap) binds to the extracellular domain of mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition factor (c&#8208;Met) and selectively induces c&#8208;Met phosphorylation at Y1003 and Y1349. The phosphorylation of Y1003 recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase casitas B&#8208;lineage lymphoma, causing c&#8208;Met ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome. Furthermore, c&#8208;Met&#8208;Ap can induce a decrease in the heterodimeric partner proteins of c&#8208;Met and the downstream effector proteins in the c&#8208;Met signal axis, effectively inhibiting tumor growth in A549 tumor&#8208;bearing BALB/c mice. Our study uncovers a novel, actionable mechanism for aptamer therapeutics and opens a new avenue for developing highly efficient anticancer drugs.

         <title>Ordered Macro/Microporous Ionic Organic Framework for Efficient Separation of Toxic Pollutants from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charged ordered macro&#8208;micro hierarchical porous organic framework with grafted viologen units is synthesized by a solid&#8208;state acid&#8208;vapor assisted synthetic strategy. The material demonstrates faster diffusion of analytes and ultrafast adsorption potency toward a wider range of organic&#8208;inorganic toxic pollutants from water.







Abstract
In case of pollutant segregation, fast mass diffusion is a fundamental criterion in order to achieve improved performance. The rapid mass transport through porous materials can be achieved by availing large open pores followed by easy and complete accessibility of functional sites. Inducing macroporosity into such materials could serve as ideal solution providing access to large macropores that offer unhindered transport of analyte and full exposure to interactive sites. Moreover, the challenge to configure the ionic&#8208;functionality with macroporosity could emerge as an unparalleled avenue toward pollutants separation. Herein, we strategized a synthetic protocol for construction of a positively charged hierarchically&#8208;porous ordered interconnected macro&#8208;structure of organic framework where the size and number of macropores can easily be tuned. The ordered macropores with strong electrostatic interaction synergistically exhibited ultrafast removal efficiency towards various toxic pollutants.

         <title>Stereoselective Chiral Molecular Carbon Imides Featuring 12&#8208;Fold [5]helicenes Around Four Cores
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular carbon imide featuring 12&#8208;fold [5]helicenes around four cores has been constructed using perylene diimide units. The structure exhibits high stereoselectivity and chirality, good solubility, and stability. Although there are four possible pairs of enantiomers with D3 symmetry, the results verify that the obtained structure belongs to the one having the lowest energy. The enantiomers can also be separated by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase.







Abstract
Despite the great progress in research on molecular carbons containing multiple helicenes around one core, realizing the stereoselectivity of carbons containing multiple helicenes around more cores is still a great challenge. Herein, molecular carbon C204 featuring 12&#8208;fold [5]helicenes around four cores was successfully constructed by using nine perylene diimide (PDI) units, and exhibits good solubility and stability. Despite 256 possible stereoisomers caused by the 12&#8208;fold [5]helicenes, we only obtained one pair of enantiomers with D3 symmetry. There are four possible pairs of enantiomers with D3 symmetry, namely 7A, 7B, 7C and 7D. Theoretical and experimental results verify that the obtained structure belongs to 7C, which has the lowest energy. The enantiomers can also be separated by chiral HPLC. These results suggest that choosing PDIs as building blocks can not only improve the solubility and stability but also realize the stereoselectivity and chirality of molecular carbons.

         <title>Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anode in a Dilute Aqueous Electrolyte Enabled by a pH Buffer Additive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional additive, NH4H2PO4, is proposed to regulate uniform zinc deposition and to suppress side reactions in a dilute aqueous electrolyte. Due to the pH buffer chemistry of NH4+ and (H2PO4)&#8722; and the &#8220;shielding effect&#8221; of NH4+, promoted Coulombic efficiencies and lifespans of Zn based symmetric/asymmetric cells can be achieved.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries have drawn increasing attention due to the intrinsic safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness and high energy density. However, parasitic reactions and non&#8208;uniform dendrite growth on the Zn anode side impede their application. Herein, a multifunctional additive, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NHP), is introduced to regulate uniform zinc deposition and to suppress side reactions. The results show that the NH4+ tends to be preferably absorbed on the Zn surface to form a &#8220;shielding effect&#8221; and blocks the direct contact of water with Zn. Moreover, NH4+ and (H2PO4)&#8722; jointly maintain pH values of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Consequently, the NHP additive enables highly reversible Zn plating/stripping behaviors in Zn//Zn and Zn//Cu cells. Furthermore, the electrochemical performances of Zn//MnO2 full cells and Zn//active carbon (AC) capacitors are improved. This work provides an efficient and general strategy for modifying Zn plating/stripping behaviors and suppressing side reactions in mild aqueous electrolyte.

         <title>Doping/Alloying Pathways to Lead&#8208;Free Halide Perovskites with Ultimate Photoluminescence Quantum Yields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free halide perovskites emit broadband visible photoluminescence originating from self&#8208;trapped excitonic states. Introduction of &#8220;alien&#8221; metals via doping or alloying into perovskite matrices often results in a dramatic enhancement of both light absorbance and emission. Mechanisms, challenges, and applications of these phenomena constitute the topic of the present Minireview.







Abstract
Tailored modifications of halide lead&#8208;free perovskites (LFPs) via doping/alloying with metal cations have been recognized as a promising pathway to highly efficient inorganic phosphors with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields of up to 100&#8201;%. Such materials typically display selective sensitivity to UV light, a broad PL range, and long PL lifetimes as well as a unique compositional variability and stability&#8212;an ideal combination for many light&#8208;harvesting applications. This Minireview presents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in doped LFPs, focusing on the reports published mostly in the last two to three years. We discuss the factors determining the efficiency and spectral parameters of the broadband PL of doped LFPs depending on the dopant and host matrix, both in micro&#8208; and nanocrystalline states, address the most relevant challenges this rapidly developing research area is facing, and outline the most promising concepts for further progress in this field.

         <title>Communication and Cross&#8208;Regulation between Chemically Fueled Sender and Receiver Reaction Networks
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chemical&#8208;fuel&#8208;driven non&#8208;equilibrium DNA&#8208;based enzymatic reaction networks have been coupled with a RNA transcription system to achieve cross&#8208;regulation and feedback between each other. This approach gives different types of signal outputs, including repression, promotion, repression&#8208;recovery, and promotion&#8208;stop.







Abstract
Nature connects multiple fuel&#8208;driven chemical/enzymatic reaction networks (CRNs/ERNs) via cross&#8208;regulation to hierarchically control biofunctions for a tailored adaption in complex sensory landscapes. Herein, we introduce a facile example of communication and cross&#8208;regulation among two fuel&#8208;driven DNA&#8208;based ERNs regulated by a concatenated RNA transcription regulator. ERN1 (&#8220;sender&#8221;) is designed for the fuel&#8208;driven promoter formation for T7 RNA polymerase, which activates RNA transcription. The produced RNA can deactivate or activate DNA in ERN2 (&#8220;receiver&#8221;) by toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement, leading to a communication between two ERNs. The RNA from ERN1 can repress or promote the fuel&#8208;driven state of ERN2; ERN2 in turn feedbacks to regulate the lifetime of ERN1. Furthermore, the incorporation of RNase H allows for RNA degradation and enables the autonomous recovery of ERN2. We believe that concatenation of multiple CRNs/ERNs provides a basis for the design of more elaborate autonomous regulatory mechanisms in systems chemistry and synthetic biology.

         <dc:description>
The covalent modification of graphene supported on a surface makes it possible to control the graphene reactivity, tailor its electronic properties, and immobilize active molecules. Based on a critical comparison of the different chemical routes, this Review provides up&#8208;to&#8208;date guidelines for working with chemically modified 2D materials on a surface.







Abstract
In the last decade, the use of graphene supported on solid surfaces has broadened its scope and applications, and graphene has acquire a promising role as a major component of high&#8208;performance electronic devices. In this context, the chemical modification of graphene has become essential. In particular, covalent modification offers key benefits, including controllability, stability, and the facility to be integrated into manufacturing operations. In this Review, we critically comment on the latest advances in the covalent modification of supported graphene on substrates. We analyze the different chemical modifications with special attention to radical reactions. In this context, we review the latest achievements in reactivity control, tailoring electronic properties, and introducing active functionalities. Finally, we extended our analysis to other emerging 2D materials supported on surfaces, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, transition metal oxides, and elemental analogs of graphene.

         <title>Skeleton&#8208;Reorganizing Coupling Reactions of Cycloheptatriene and Cycloalkenones with Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual catalytic coupling reaction of cycloheptatriene and cycloalkenones with amines proceeds through a skeleton&#8208;reorganization process for the selective synthesis of fused 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reactions proceed through a retro&#8208;Mannich&#8208;type ring&#8208;opening and a subsequent intramolecular Povarov process.







Abstract
Skeletal reorganization reactions have emerged as an intriguing tool for converting readily available compounds into complicated molecules inaccessible by traditional methods. Herein, we report a unique skeleton&#8208;reorganizing coupling reaction of cycloheptatriene and cycloalkenones with amines. In the presence of Rh/acid catalysis, cycloheptatriene can selectively couple with anilines to deliver fused 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline products. Mechanistic studies indicate that the retro&#8208;Mannich type ring&#8208;opening and subsequent intramolecular Povarov reaction account for the ring reorganization. Our mechanistic studies also revealed that skeleton&#8208;reorganizing amination between anilines and cycloalkenones can be achieved with acid. The synthetic utilization of this skeleton&#8208;reorganizing coupling reaction was showcased with a gram&#8208;scale reaction, synthetic derivatizations, and the late&#8208;stage modification of commercial drugs.

         <title>An Antitumor Dual&#8208;Responsive Host&#8208;Guest Supramolecular Polymer Based on Hypoxia&#8208;Cleavable Azocalix[4]arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A host&#8211;guest dual&#8208;response supramolecular polymer was prepared based on a dimeric hypoxia&#8208;responsive azocalixrene and GSH&#8208;cleavable CPT dimer (D&#8208;CPT), which further self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles and exhibits excellent antitumor therapy performance.







Abstract
The exploitation of specific guests which can respond to external stimuli is the main approach for the construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular polymers (SPs) based on host&#8211;guest interactions. Most functional guests, however, fail to manifest stimuli&#8208;responses. Herein, a hypoxia&#8208;responsive dimeric azocalixarene (D&#8208;SAC4A) with outstanding hosting properties was used as the macrocyclic building block for the preparation of host stimuli&#8208;responsive SPs. Since azocalixarenes can also be compatible with stimuli&#8208;responsive guests, an antitumor drug, camptothecin (CPT), was chosen and linked via a disulfide&#8208;containing linker to afford a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive ditropic guest (D&#8208;CPT). A unique dual&#8208;responsive SP was obtained by 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixing of D&#8208;SAC4A and D&#8208;CPT in water, which further assembled into SP nanoparticles (DSPNs). DSPNs displayed outstanding stability against dilution and biological interferants, as well as precise CPT&#8208;release under GSH and hypoxia conditions. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the good biosafety and tumor&#8208;suppressive effects of DSPNs.

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Upgrading to Triethanolamine by Bromine&#8208;Assisted C2H4 Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CO2 upgrading strategy was developed by using Br&#8208;assisted C2H4 oxidation, which exploits the preferential adsorption of *Br over *OH on metal phthalocyanine electrocatalysts. The C2H4 oxidation was further coupled with the nitrite reduction to form triethanolamine. Using two electrolysis cells in tandem, the capability of electrochemical fixation of CO2 and nitrite ions into triethanolamine at ambient conditions was demonstrated.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction is a promising approach for converting this greenhouse gas into value&#8208;added chemicals, while the capability of producing products with longer carbon chains (Cn&gt;3) is limited. Herein, we demonstrate the Br&#8208;assisted electrocatalytic oxidation of ethylene (C2H4), a major CO2 electroreduction product, into 2&#8208;bromoethanol by electro&#8208;generated bromine on metal phthalocyanine catalysts. Due to the preferential formation of Br2 over *O or Cl2 to activate the C=C bond, a high partial current density of producing 2&#8208;bromoethanol (46.6&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2) was obtained with 87.2&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency. Further coupling with the electrocatalytic nitrite reduction to ammonia at the cathode allowed the production of triethanolamine with six carbon atoms. Moreover, by coupling a CO2 electrolysis cell for in situ C2H4 generation and a C2H4 oxidation/nitrite reduction cell, the capability of upgrading of CO2 and nitrite into triethanolamine was demonstrated.

         <title>A Nanocomposite of Bismuth Clusters and Bi2O2CO3 Sheets for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalyst derived from Bi2S3 is very powerful for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid, achieving a current density of 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a formate Faradaic efficiency of 93&#8201;% and a single&#8208;pass formate yield of 67&#8201;%. The active catalyst is composed of Bi nanoclusters on Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets and the interfacial Bi site plays a pivotal role.







Abstract
The renewable&#8208;electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to formic acid would contribute to establishing a carbon&#8208;neutral society. The current catalyst suffers from limited activity and stability under high selectivity and the ambiguous nature of active sites. Herein, we report a powerful Bi2S3&#8208;derived catalyst that demonstrates a current density of 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a formate Faradaic efficiency of 93&#8201;% at &#8722;0.95&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. The energy conversion efficiency and single&#8208;pass yield of formate reach 80&#8201;% and 67&#8201;%, respectively, and the durability reaches 100&#8197;h at an industrial&#8208;relevant current density. Pure formic acid with a concentration of 3.5&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 has been produced continuously. Our operando spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal the dynamic evolution of the catalyst into a nanocomposite composed of Bi0 clusters and Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets and the pivotal role of Bi0&#8722;Bi2O2CO3 interface in CO2 activation and conversion.

         <title>Umpolung Asymmetric 1,5&#8208;Conjugate Addition via Palladium Hydride Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional umpolung protocol was demonstrated for novel 1,5&#8208;conjugate additions via palladium hydride catalyst. Three catalytic systems including 1,5&#8208;addition cascade with inter&#8208; and intramolecular [3+2] cyclization and migratory 1,5&#8208;addition were established via palladium or palladium/organo&#8208;cocatalysis.







Abstract
Electronically matched nucleophilic 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition has been well studied and widely applied in synthetic areas. In contrast, nucleophilic 1,5&#8208;conjugate addition represents an electronically forbidden process and is considered unfeasible. Here, we describe modular protocols for 1,5&#8208;conjugate addition reactions via palladium hydride catalysis. Both palladium and synergistic Pd/organocatalyst systems are developed to catalyze 1,5&#8208;conjugate reaction, followed by inter&#8208; or intramolecular [3+2] cyclization. A migratory 1,5&#8208;addition protocol is established to corroborate the feasibility of this umpolung concept. The 1,5&#8208;addition products are conveniently transformed into a series of privileged enantioenriched motifs, including polysubstituted tetrahydrofuran, dihydrofuran, cyclopropane, cyclobutane, azetidine, oxetane, thietane, spirocycle and bridged rings. Preliminary mechanistic studies corroborate the involvement of palladium hydride catalysis.

         <title>A Multifunctional Polymer as an Interfacial Layer for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multifunctional polymer, poly(methyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;acrylamide), was designed and utilized to synergistically passivate the under&#8208;coordinated Pb2+ and anchor the I&#8208; of the [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedron on the surface of a perovskite film. This passivation leads to an enhancement in the open&#8208;circuit voltage from 1.12 to 1.22&#8197;V and improved stability in solar cell devices, with the device maintaining 95&#8201;% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 1000&#8197;h of maximum power point tracking. Additionally, a large&#8208;area solar cell device was fabricated using this approach, achieving a PCE of 20.64&#8201;%.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;cation defects and halogen&#8208;anion defects in perovskite films are critical to the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, a random polymer, poly(methyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;acrylamide) (PMMA&#8208;AM), was synthesized to serve as an interfacial passivation layer for synergistically passivating the under&#8208;coordinated Pb2+ and anchor the I&#8208; of the [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedron. Additionally, the interfacial PMMA&#8208;AM passivation layer cannot be destroyed during the hole transport layer deposition because of its low solubility in chlorobenzene. This passivation leads to an enhancement in the open&#8208;circuit voltage from 1.12 to 1.22&#8197;V and improved stability in solar cell devices, with the device maintaining 95&#8201;% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 1000&#8197;h of maximum power point tracking.

         <title>Mutability&#8208;Landscape&#8208;Guided Engineering of l&#8208;Threonine Aldolase Revealing the Prelog Rule in Mediating Diastereoselectivity of C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Prelog rule in l&#8208;threonine aldolase holds that when the C&#945; anion of PLP&#8208;Gly attacks the carbonyl carbon atom of the aldehyde from the re&#8208;face, the (2S,3S)&#8208;configured product is formed, whereas attack from the si&#8208;face forms the (2S,3R)&#8208;configured product. Guided by this rule, mutants of LTA with improved diastereoselectivity of 99.2&#8201;%syn and 97.4&#8201;%anti were obtained.







Abstract
l&#8208;threonine aldolase (LTA) catalyzes C&#8722;C bond synthesis with moderate diastereoselectivity. In this study, with LTA from Cellulosilyticum sp (CpLTA) as an object, a mutability landscape was first constructed by performing saturation mutagenesis at substrate access tunnel amino acids. The combinatorial active&#8208;site saturation test/iterative saturation mutation (CAST/ISM) strategy was then used to tune diastereoselectivity. As a result, the diastereoselectivity of mutant H305L/Y8H/V143R was improved from 37.2&#8201;%syn to 99.4&#8201;%syn. Furthermore, the diastereoselectivity of mutant H305Y/Y8I/W307E was inverted to 97.2&#8201;%anti. Based on insight provided by molecular dynamics simulations and coevolution analysis, the Prelog rule was employed to illustrate the diastereoselectivity regulation mechanism of LTA, holding that the asymmetric formation of the C&#8722;C bond was caused by electrons attacking the carbonyl carbon atom of the substrate aldehyde from the re or si face. The study would be useful to expand LTA applications and guide engineering of other C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming enzymes.

         <title>Selecting Better Biocatalysts by Complementing Recoded Bacteria
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in vivo selection strategy is presented, in which bacteria addicted to non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) are complemented by enzymes that can yield these building blocks from synthetic precursors. As growth rates under selective conditions correlate with enzyme activities, serial passaging elicited better biocatalysts from populations harboring enzyme libraries. The platform was used to improve the activity of carbamoylases for ncAA&#8208;precursors.







Abstract
In vivo selections are powerful tools for the directed evolution of enzymes. However, the need to link enzymatic activity to cellular survival makes selections for enzymes that do not fulfill a metabolic function challenging. Here, we present an in vivo selection strategy that leverages recoded organisms addicted to non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) to evolve biocatalysts that can provide these building blocks from synthetic precursors.

&lt;p&gt;An in vivo selection strategy is presented, in which bacteria addicted to non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) are complemented by enzymes that can yield these building blocks from synthetic precursors. As growth rates under selective conditions correlate with enzyme activities, serial passaging elicited better biocatalysts from populations harboring enzyme libraries. The platform was used to improve the activity of carbamoylases for ncAA-precursors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vivo selections are powerful tools for the directed evolution of enzymes. However, the need to link enzymatic activity to cellular survival makes selections for enzymes that do not fulfill a metabolic function challenging. Here, we present an in vivo selection strategy that leverages recoded organisms addicted to non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) to evolve biocatalysts that can provide these building blocks from synthetic precursors. We exemplify our platform by engineering carbamoylases that display catalytic efficiencies more than five orders of magnitude higher than those observed for the wild-type enzyme for ncAA-precursors. As growth rates of bacteria under selective conditions correlate with enzymatic activities, we were able to elicit improved variants from populations by performing serial passaging. By requiring minimal human intervention and no specialized equipment, we surmise that our strategy will become a versatile tool for the in vivo directed evolution of diverse biocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Organosulfur and Lithium&#8208;Metal Hosts Enabled by C@Fe3N Sponge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C@Fe3N with both lithiophilic property and catalytic feature can simultaneously address the growth of dendritic Li in the anode and intermediates shuttling from the cathode. These synergistic effect of C@Fe3N leads to an extremely stable cycling performance over 1&#8201;000 cycles in a Li&#8208;organosulfur full cell with practically necessary parameters.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;organosulfur (Li&#8208;OS) batteries, despite possessing high theoretical specific capacity, encounter a few practical challenges, including unsatisfactory lifespan and low active material utilization under realistic conditions. Here, diisoropyl xanthogen polysulfide (DIXPS) has been selected as a model organosulfur compound to investigate the practical feasibility of Li&#8208;OS batteries under realistic conditions. A well&#8208;designed freestanding carbon sponge decorated with Fe3N nanoparticles (C@Fe3N) is introduced into the Li&#8208;OS cells as a scaffold for both Li and DIXPS. The lithiophilic property of the C@Fe3N host guides uniform lithium deposition at the anode, and the catalysis of the DIXPS conversion reaction promotes the kinetics at the cathode. Impressively, the synergistic effect of C@Fe3N leads to an extremely stable cycling performance over 1&#8201;000 cycles in a Li&#8208;OS full cell under realistic conditions.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Based TREM2 Inhibitor Suppresses Tumors by Remodeling the Immunosuppressive Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum complex OPA shows a potent chemoimmunotherapeutic effect on tumors by impeding DNA replication and inhibiting triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells&#8208;2 (TREM2). OPA promotes the polarization of macrophages from immunosuppressive M2 to tumoricidal M1 phenotype, and stimulates dendritic, cytotoxic T, and natural killer cells to restrain cancer cells. By transforming the tumor microenvironment, OPA overcomes the tumor resistance to platinum drugs.







Abstract
Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells&#8208;2 (TREM2) is a key pro&#8208;tumorigenic marker of tumor&#8208;infiltrating macrophages, showing potent immunosuppressive activity in tumor microenvironment. A platinum(IV) complex OPA derived from oxaliplatin (OP) and artesunate (ART) exhibited direct cytotoxicity against human colon cancer cells and immunomodulatory activity to inhibit TREM2 on macrophages in vitro and vivo. Furthermore, OPA deterred the tumor growth in mouse models bearing MC38 colorectal tumor by reducing the number of CD206+ and CX3CR1+ immunosuppressive macrophages; it also promoted the expansion and infiltration of immunostimulatory dendritic, cytotoxic T, and natural killer cells. OPA is the first small&#8208;molecular TREM2 inhibitor capable of relieving immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhancing chemical anticancer efficiency of a platinum drug, thus showing typical characteristics of a chemoimmunotherapeutic agent.

         <title>Bioconjugation via Hetero&#8208;Selective Clamping of Two Different Amines with ortho&#8208;Phthalaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple ortho&#8208;phthalaldehyde (OPA) reagent enables a facile and broadly applicable bioconjugation strategy via hetero&#8208;selective clamping of two different endogenous amino handles such as &#1013;&#8208;NH2 of lysine and &#945;&#8208;NH2 of &#945;&#8208;amino acids without any pre&#8208;functionalization.







Abstract
Amino groups are common in both natural and synthetic compounds and offer a very attractive class of endogenous handles for bioconjugation. However, the ability to differentiate two types of amino groups and join them with high hetero&#8208;selectivity and efficiency in a complex setting remains elusive. Herein, we report a new method for bioconjugation via one&#8208;pot chemoselective clamping of two different amine nucleophiles using a simple ortho&#8208;phthalaldehyde (OPA) reagent. Various &#945;&#8208;amino acids, aryl amines, and secondary amines can be crosslinked to the &#1013;&#8208;amino side chain of lysine on peptides or proteins with high efficiency and hetero&#8208;selectivity. This method offers a simple and powerful means to crosslink small molecule drugs, imaging probes, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, and even virus particles without any pre&#8208;functionalization.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Cyclisation Reaction for the Synthesis of Highly&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydroquinolines and Quinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild one&#8208;pot condensation/light&#8208;mediated cyclisation reaction leading to a diverse range of densely functionalised tetrahydroquinoline and quinoline products is described, proceeding via divergent electrocyclisation and photoredox pathways, respectively. Thorough exploration of the reaction substrate scope, reaction intermediates and mechanistic pathways uncover the key driving forces for the observed reactivity and stereochemistry.







Abstract
Condensation of 2&#8208;vinylanilines and conjugated aldehydes followed by an efficient light&#8208;mediated cyclisation selectively yields either substituted tetrahydroquinolines with typically high dr, or in the presence of an iridium photocatalyst the synthesis of quinoline derivatives is demonstrated. These atom economical processes require mild conditions, with the substrate scope demonstrating excellent site selectivity and functional group tolerance, including azaarene&#8208;bearing substrates. A thorough experimental mechanistic investigation explores multiple pathways and the key role that imine and iminium intermediates play in the absorption of visible light to generate reactive excited states. The synthetic utility of the reactions is demonstrated on gram scale quantities in both batch and flow, alongside further manipulation of the medicinally relevant products.

         <title>Reversible Dihydrogen Activation and Catalytic H/D Exchange with Group 10 Heterometallic Complexes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of a hexagonal planar palladium complex with a [PdMg3H3] core with H2 is reversible and leads to the formation of a new [PdMg2H4] tetrahydride species. DFT calculations support a mechanism for H2 activation involving a ligand&#8208;assisted oxidative addition to Pd. These findings were exploited to develop a catalytic protocol for H/D exchange into magnesium hydride and zinc hydride bonds.







Abstract
Reaction of a hexagonal planar palladium complex featuring a [PdMg3H3] core with H2 is reversible and leads to the formation of a new [PdMg2H4] tetrahydride species alongside an equivalent of a magnesium hydride co&#8208;product [MgH]. While the reversibility of this process prevented isolation of [PdMg2H4], analogous [PtMg2H4] and [PtZn2H4] complexes could be isolated and characterised through independent syntheses. Computational analysis (DFT, AIM, NCIPlot) of the bonding in a series of heterometallic tetrahydride compounds (Ni&#8211;Pt; Mg and Zn) suggests that these complexes are best described as square planar with marginal metal&#8208;metal interactions; the strength of which increases slightly as group 10 is descended and increases from Mg to Zn. DFT calculations support a mechanism for H2 activation involving a ligand&#8208;assisted oxidative addition to Pd. These findings were exploited to develop a catalytic protocol for H/D exchange into magnesium hydride and zinc hydride bonds.

While the reversibility of this process prevented isolation of [PdMg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;], analogous [PtMg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] and [PtZn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] complexes could be isolated and characterised through independent syntheses. Computational analysis (DFT, AIM, NCIPlot) of the bonding in a series of heterometallic tetrahydride compounds (Ni&#8211;Pt; Mg and Zn) suggests that these complexes are best described as square planar with marginal metal-metal interactions; the strength of which increases slightly as group 10 is descended and increases from Mg to Zn. DFT calculations support a mechanism for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation involving a ligand-assisted oxidative addition to Pd. These findings were exploited to develop a catalytic protocol for H/D exchange into magnesium hydride and zinc hydride bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bias&#8208;Free Solar&#8208;Driven Syngas Production: A Fe2O3 Photoanode Featuring Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt Integrated with a Silver&#8208;Palladium Cathode</title>

         <dc:description>
Photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 using a Ag/Pd cathode, integrated with a Fe2O3 photoanode decorated with single&#8208;atom cobalt, achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;syngas conversion efficiency of 2.69&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical syngas production from aqueous CO2 is a promising technique for carbon capture and utilization. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient and tunable syngas production by integrating a single&#8208;atom cobalt&#8208;catalyst&#8208;decorated &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanode with a bimetallic Ag/Pd alloy cathode. A record syngas production activity of 81.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 (CO/H2 ratio: &#8776;1&#8201;:&#8201;1) was achieved under artificial sunlight (AM 1.5 G) with an excellent durability. Systematic studies reveal that the Co single atoms effectively extract the holes from Fe2O3 photoanodes and serve as active sites for promoting oxygen evolution. Simultaneously, the Pd and Ag atoms in bimetallic cathodes selectively adsorb CO2 and protons for facilitating CO production. Further incorporation with a photovoltaic, to allow solar light (&gt;600&#8197;nm) to be utilized, yields a bias&#8208;free CO2 reduction device with solar&#8208;to&#8208;CO and solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2 conversion efficiencies up to 1.33 and 1.36 %, respectively.

         <title>Infrared Diffusion&#8208;Ordered Spectroscopy Reveals Molecular Size and Structure
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Infrared diffusion&#8208;ordered spectroscopy is a simple and cost&#8208;effective way to simultaneously characterize size and chemical structure of molecules, molecular aggregates/complexes, or small particles.







Abstract
Inspired by ideas from NMR, we have developed Infrared Diffusion&#8208;Ordered Spectroscopy (IR&#8208;DOSY), which simultaneously characterizes molecular structure and size. We rely on the fact that the diffusion coefficient of a molecule is determined by its size through the Stokes&#8211;Einstein relation, and achieve sensitivity to the diffusion coefficient by creating a concentration gradient and tracking its equilibration in an IR&#8208;frequency resolved manner. Analogous to NMR&#8208;DOSY, a two&#8208;dimensional IR&#8208;DOSY spectrum has IR frequency along one axis and diffusion coefficient (or equivalently, size) along the other, so the chemical structure and the size of a compound are characterized simultaneously. In an IR&#8208;DOSY spectrum of a mixture, molecules with different sizes are nicely separated into distinct sets of IR peaks. Extending this idea to higher dimensions, we also perform 3D&#8208;IR&#8208;DOSY, in which we combine the conformation sensitivity of femtosecond multi&#8208;dimensional IR spectroscopy with size sensitivity.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Electrochemical C&#8722;H Carboxylation of Arenes with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and selective approach for the electrochemical C&#8722;H carboxylation of arenes with CO2 has been developed to obtain the valuable aromatic carboxylic acids with excellent atom economy. High levels of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity were achieved by this electrochemical reductive activation strategy.







Abstract
Herein, a direct, metal&#8208;free, and site&#8208;selective electrochemical C&#8722;H carboxylation of arenes by reductive activation using CO2 as the economic and abundant carboxylic source was reported. The electrocarboxylation was carried out in an operationally simple manner with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, setting the stage for the challenging site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of unactivated (hetero)arenes. The robust nature of the electrochemical strategy was reflected by a broad scope of substrates with excellent atom economy and unique selectivity. Notably, the direct and selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of various challenging arenes worked well in this approach, including electron&#8208;deficient naphthalenes, pyridines, simple phenyl derivatives, and substituted quinolines. The method benefits from being externally catalyst&#8208;free, metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;free, which makes it extremely attractive for potential applications.

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable Electroluminescent Elastomers with Self&#8208;Confinement Effect for Highly Efficient Non&#8208;Blended Stretchable OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving high&#8208;performance electroluminescence under large deformation remains a grand challenge. In this contribution, a general concept based on the self&#8208;confinement effect has been proposed for the design and synthesis of non&#8208;blended intrinsically stretchable electroluminescent elastomers (ISEEs). High&#8208;performance non&#8208;blended stretchable OLEDs have been constructed based on the resulting ISEEs.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;flexible stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are emerging as a basic component of flexible electronics and human&#8208;machine interfaces. However, the brightness and efficiency of stretchable OLEDs remain still far inferior to their rigid counterparts, owing to the scarcity of satisfactory stretchable electroluminescent materials. Herein, we explore a general concept based on the self&#8208;confinement effect to dramatically improve the stretchability of elastomers, without affecting electroluminescent properties. The balanced rigid/flexible chain dynamics under self&#8208;confinement significantly reduces the modulus of the elastomers, resulting in the maximum strain reaching 806&#8201;%. Ultra&#8208;flexible stretchable OLEDs have been constructed based on the resulting ISEEs, achieving unprecedented high&#8208;performance non&#8208;blended stretchable OLEDs. The results suggest an effective molecular design strategy for highly deformable stretchable displays and flexible electronics.

         <title>Electronic Effect&#8208;Modulated Enhancements of Proton Conductivity in Porous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic polymers with improved proton conductivity were prepared by modulating substituents with different electronic effects. The sulfonated materials showed top&#8208;tier conductivity, excellent long&#8208;term stability, and low activation energy.







Abstract
We proposed a new strategy to maximize the density of acidic groups by modulating the electronic effects of the substituents for high&#8208;performance proton conductors. The conductivity of the sulfonated 1&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S with methyl group corresponds to 2.29&#215;10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8201;% relative humidity, remarkably an 22100&#8208;fold enhancement over the nonsulfonated 1&#8208;MeL40. 1&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S maintains long&#8208;term conductivity for one month. We confirm that this synthetic method is generalized to the extended version POPs, 2&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S and 3&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S. In particular, the conductivities of the POPs compete with those of top&#8208;level porous organic conductors. Moreover, the activation energy of the POPs is lower than that of the top&#8208;performing materials. This study demonstrates that systematic alteration of the electronic effects of substituents is a useful route to improve the conductivity and long&#8208;term durability of proton&#8208;conducting materials.

The conductivity of the sulfonated &lt;b&gt;1-MeL40-S&lt;/b&gt; with methyl group corresponds to 2.29&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8201;% relative humidity, remarkably an 22100-fold enhancement over the nonsulfonated &lt;b&gt;1-MeL40&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;1-MeL40-S&lt;/b&gt; maintains long-term conductivity for one month. We confirm that this synthetic method is generalized to the extended version POPs, &lt;b&gt;2-MeL40-S&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3-MeL40-S&lt;/b&gt;. In particular, the conductivities of the POPs compete with those of top-level porous organic conductors. Moreover, the activation energy of the POPs is lower than that of the top-performing materials. This study demonstrates that systematic alteration of the electronic effects of substituents is a useful route to improve the conductivity and long-term durability of proton-conducting materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programming Non&#8208;Nucleic Acid Molecules into Computational Nucleic Acid Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With utilization of conformationally controlled ligand converters, kinds of non&#8208;nucleic acid molecules, including both small molecules and proteins, can be integrated into nucleic acid computation to construct circuitries with increased complexity and scalability and to even perform algorithmic calculations. This hybridized system establishes a universal platform for molecular computation.







Abstract
Nucleic acid (NA) computation has been widely developed in the past years to solve kinds of logic and mathematic issues in both information technologies and biomedical analysis. However, the difficulty to integrate non&#8208;NA molecules limits its power as a universal platform for molecular computation. Here, we report a versatile prototype of hybridized computation integrated with both nucleic acids and non&#8208;NA molecules. Employing the conformationally controlled ligand converters, we demonstrate that non&#8208;NA molecules, including both small molecules and proteins, can be computed as nucleic acid strands to construct the circuitry with increased complexity and scalability, and can be even programmed to solve arithmetical calculations within the computational nucleic acid system. This study opens a new door for molecular computation in which all&#8208;NA circuits can be expanded with integration of various ligands, and meanwhile, ligands can be precisely programmed by the nuclei acid computation.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Laser Emission from Homochiral Superstructures based on Achiral Molecules with Conformal Flexibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on a rational strategy to clamp the molecular conformational and facilitate parallel packing of achiral D&#8208;A molecules. It leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking during crystallization. When this emergent homochirality is coupled with optical gain of the molecules, the homochiral crystals are explored as excellent circularly polarized micro&#8208;lasers with low lasing threshold (16.4&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and high dissymmetry factor glum (0.9).







Abstract
Without external chiral intervention, it is a challenge to form homochirality from achiral molecules with conformational flexibility. We here report on a rational strategy that uses multivalent noncovalent interactions to clamp the molecular conformations of achiral D&#8208;A molecules. These interactions overcome the otherwise dominant dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and thus disfavor their symmetric antiparallel stacking. It in turn facilitates parallel packing, leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking during crystallization and thus the formation of homochiral conglomerates. When this emergent homochirality is coupled with optical gain characteristics of the molecules, the homochiral crystals are explored as excellent circularly polarized micro&#8208;lasers with low lasing threshold (16.4&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and high dissymmetry factor glum (0.9). This study therefore provides a facile design strategy for supramolecular chiral materials and active laser ones without the necessity of intrinsic chiral element.

         <title>Ru3(CO)12&#8208;Catalyzed Modular Assembly of Hemilabile Ligands by C&#8211;H Activation of Phosphines with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hemilabile ligands have been applied extensively in transition metal catalysis, but preparations of these molecules typically require multistep synthesis. Here, modular assembly of diverse phosphine&#8208;amide ligands, including related axially chiral compounds, is first reported through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation of phosphines with isocyanate directed by phosphorus(III) atoms. High reactivity and regioselectivity can be obtained by using a Ru3(CO)12 catalyst with an MPAA ligand. This transformation significantly expands the pool of phosphine&#8208;amide ligands, some of which have shown excellent efficiency for asymmetric catalysis. More broadly, the discovery constitutes a proof of principle for facile construction of hemilabile ligands directly from the parent monodentate phosphines by C&#8211;H activation with ideal atom, step and redox economy. Several dinuclear ruthenium complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealing the key mechanistic features of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Uncontrolled dendrites growth and serious parasitic reactions in aqueous electrolytes, greatly hinder the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion battery. On the basis of in&#8208;situ&#8208;chemical construction and performance&#8208;improving mechanism, multifunctional fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) is introduced into aqueous electrolyte to construct a high&#8208;quality and ZnF2&#8208;riched inorganic/organic hybrid SEI (ZHS) layer on Zn metal anode (ZMA) surface. Notably, FEC additive can regulate the solvated structure of Zn2+ to reduce H2O molecules reactivity. Additionally, the ZHS layer with strong Zn2+ affinity can avoid dendrites formation and hinder the direct contact between the electrolyte and anode. Therefore, the dendrites growth, Zn corrosion, and H2 evolution reaction on ZMA in FEC&#8208;included ZnSO4 electrolyte are highly suppressed. Thus, ZMA in such electrolyte realize a long cycle life over 1000 h and deliver a stable coulombic efficiency of 99.1% after 500 cycles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Pyrazolines and pyrazoles are common and important motifs of pharmaceutical agents and agrochemicals. Herein, the first electrochemical approach for their direct synthesis from easily accessible hydrazones and dipolarophiles up to decagram scale is presented. The application of a biphasic system (aqueous/organic) even allows for the conversion of highly sensitive alkenes, wherein inexpensive sodium iodide is employed in a dual role as supporting electrolyte and mediator. In addition, mechanistic insight into the reaction is given by the isolation of key step intermediates. The relevance of the presented reaction is underlined by the synthesis of commercial herbicide safener mefenpyr&#8208;diethyl in good yields.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the guest&#8208;induced dynamic deformation process of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is vitally important to further increase their stimulus&#8208;response performances. Here we report on the dark&#8208;field microscopic (DFM) imaging approach to in situ monitor the guest&#8208;induced deformation evolution of individual COF&#8208;300 crystals in real time. We observe not only transient and nonequilibrium intermediate deformation states but also local surface curvature&#8208;driven diverse adsorption behaviours of single COF&#8208;300 particles for dichloromethane (DCM), undergoing one, two, and multiple expansion&#8208;contraction deformations as well as contraction&#8208;to&#8208;expansion transition. The surface curvature&#8208;dominated deformations are ascribed to the significant differences in the adsorption capacity for DCM at the curved tip and flat side regions, in which DCM can be adsorbed preferentially by curved tip regions of COF&#8208;300.</dc:description>

         <title>Overall Carbon&#8208;neutral Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 in Molten Salts using a Liquid Metal Sn Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An overall carbon&#8208;neutral CO2 electroreduction requires enhanced conversion efficiency and intensified functionality of CO2&#8208;derived products to balance the carbon footprint from CO2 electroreduction against fixed CO2. A liquid Sn cathode is herein introduced into electrochemical reduction of CO2 in molten salts to fabricate core&#8211;shell Sn&#8211;C spheres (Sn@C). An in&#8208;situ generated Li2SnO3/C directs a self&#8208;template formation of Sn@C. Benefitting from the accelerated reaction kinetics from the liquid Sn cathode and the core&#8211;shell structure of Sn@C, a CO2&#8208;fixation current efficiency higher than 84% and a high reversible lithium&#8208;storage capacity of Sn@C are achieved. The versatility of this strategy is demonstrated by other low melting point metals, such as Zn and Bi. This process integrates energy&#8208;efficient CO2 conversion and template&#8208;free fabrication of value&#8208;added metal&#8211;carbon, achieving an overall carbon&#8208;neutral electrochemical reduction of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Harvesting Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks with Gigantic Al24 Units and their Deconstruction into Molecular Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the vast Al&#8208;oxo molecular cluster chemistry, Al&#8208;based building units for metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) construction are limited in structural diversity and complexity. Synthesis of single crystalline MOFs based on this &#8220;hard&#8221; metal is further complicated by the poor reversibility of the Al&#8211;organic coordination linkages. Here, a strategy to employ two kinds of linkages with distinct strength&#8212;strong Al&#8722;carboxylate linkage and weak Cu&#8722;pyrazol N linkage&#8212;gives FDM&#8208;91 (FDM = Fudan Materials) with gigantic Al24&#8208;based units. After replacing the weak moieties with organic linkers post&#8208;synthetically, two new stable MOFs with exceptional water harvesting capacity (up to 0.53 g g&#8208;1) and outstanding cycling performance are developed. Linkage&#8208;selective dissociation of FDM&#8208;91 further leads to the isolation of the Al24 molecular clusters. The versatile chemistry performed here to reinforce or deconstruct MOFs provides a new way to make important extended and discrete structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanostructured Heterogeneous Catalysts for Bioorthogonal Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal chemistry has inspired a new subarea of artificial chemistry providing a powerful tool to perform novel biocompatible chemospecific reactions in living systems. Complying with the premise that they do not interfere with biological functions, bioorthogonal reactions are increasingly applied in biomedical research, particularly with respect to genetic encoding systems, fluorogenic reactions for bioimaging, or cancer therapy. This review compiles recent advances in the use of heterogeneous catalysts for bioorthogonal reactions. The synthetic strategies of Pd, Au, and Cu&#8208;based materials, their applicability in the activation of caged fluorophores and prodrugs, and the possibilities of using external stimuli to release therapeutic substances within a specific location of a diseased tissue are discussed. Finally, we highlight frontiers in the field, identifying challenges, and propose directions for future development in this emerging field.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ detection of cobaloxime intermediates during photocatalysis using hollow&#8208;core photonic crystal fiber microreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hollow&#8208;core photonic crystal fibers (HC&#8208;PCFs) provide a novel approach for in&#8208;situ UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy with enhanced detection sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate that longer optical path lengths than afforded by conventional cuvette&#8208;based UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy can be used to detect and identify the Co(I) and Co(II) states in hydrogen&#8208;evolving cobaloxime catalysts, with spectral identification aided by comparison with DFT&#8208;simulated spectra. Our findings show that there are two types of signals observed for these molecular catalysts; a transient signal and a steady&#8208;state signal, with the former being assigned to the Co(I) state and the latter being assigned to the Co(II) state. These observations lend support to a unimolecular pathway, rather than a bimolecular pathway, for hydrogen evolution. This study highlights the utility of fiber&#8208;based microreactors for understanding these and a much wider range of homogeneous photocatalytic systems of the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Monosaccharide Channels: Size&#8208;Selective Transmembrane Transport of Glucose and Fructose Mediated by Porphyrin Boxes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;persistent organic cages, porphyrin boxes (PBs), have been used to construct synthetic monosaccharide channels. These cages facilitate the transmembrane transport of glucose and fructose through their windows, while impeding the transport of larger sized sugars because of the limited size of the cage windows, thus facilitating size&#8208;selective transport. Live cells treated with the PBs show glucose uptake and enhanced cell viability.







Abstract
Here we report synthetic monosaccharide channels built with shape&#8208;persistent organic cages, porphyrin boxes (PBs), that allow facile transmembrane transport of glucose and fructose through their windows. PBs show a much higher transport rate for glucose and fructose over disaccharides such as sucrose, as evidenced by intravesicular enzyme assays and molecular dynamics simulations. The transport rate can be modulated by changing the length of the alkyl chains decorating the cage windows. Insertion of a linear pillar ligand into the cavity of PBs blocks the monosaccharide transport. In vitro cell experiment shows that PBs transport glucose across the living&#8208;cell membrane and enhance cell viability when the natural glucose transporter GLUT1 is blocked. Time&#8208;dependent live&#8208;cell imaging and MTT assays confirm the cyto&#8208;compatibility of PBs. The monosaccharide&#8208;selective transport ability of PBs is reminiscent of natural glucose transporters (GLUTs), which are crucial for numerous biological functions.

         <title>Synthesis and Degradation of Vinyl Polymers with Evenly Distributed Thioacetal Bonds in Main Chains: Cationic DT Copolymerization of Vinyl Ethers and Cyclic Thioacetals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Degradable poly(vinyl ether)s were synthesized with periodically arranged in&#8208;chain thioacetal bonds via cationic degenerative chain&#8208;transfer copolymerization of vinyl ethers with a 7&#8208;membered cyclic thioacetal. The copolymers can be degraded into low&#8208; and controlled&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers via hydrolysis. One&#8208;pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers and their degradation into diblock copolymers is also achieved.







Abstract
We report a novel method to synthesize degradable poly(vinyl ether)s with cleavable thioacetal bonds periodically arranged in the main chains using controlled cationic copolymerization of vinyl ethers with a 7&#8208;membered cyclic thioacetal (7&#8208;CTA) via degenerative chain transfer (DT) to the internal thioacetal bonds. The thioacetal bonds, which are introduced into the main chain by cationic ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of 7&#8208;CTA with vinyl ethers, serve as in&#8208;chain dormant species to allow homogeneous propagation of vinyl ethers for all internal segments to afford copolymers with controlled overall and segmental molecular weights. The obtained polymers can be degraded into low&#8208; and controlled&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions via hydrolysis. Various vinyl ethers with hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and functional pendants are available. Finally, one&#8208;pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers and their degradation into diblock copolymers are also achieved.

     alt="Synthesis and Degradation of Vinyl Polymers with Evenly Distributed Thioacetal Bonds in Main Chains: Cationic DT Copolymerization of Vinyl Ethers and Cyclic Thioacetals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Degradable poly(vinyl ether)s were synthesized with periodically arranged in-chain thioacetal bonds via cationic degenerative chain-transfer copolymerization of vinyl ethers with a 7-membered cyclic thioacetal. The copolymers can be degraded into low- and controlled-molecular-weight polymers via hydrolysis. One-pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers and their degradation into diblock copolymers is also achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a novel method to synthesize degradable poly(vinyl ether)s with cleavable thioacetal bonds periodically arranged in the main chains using controlled cationic copolymerization of vinyl ethers with a 7-membered cyclic thioacetal (&lt;b&gt;7-CTA&lt;/b&gt;) via degenerative chain transfer (DT) to the internal thioacetal bonds. The thioacetal bonds, which are introduced into the main chain by cationic ring-opening copolymerization of &lt;b&gt;7-CTA&lt;/b&gt; with vinyl ethers, serve as in-chain dormant species to allow homogeneous propagation of vinyl ethers for all internal segments to afford copolymers with controlled overall and segmental molecular weights. The obtained polymers can be degraded into low- and controlled-molecular-weight polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions via hydrolysis. Various vinyl ethers with hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and functional pendants are available. Finally, one-pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers and their degradation into diblock copolymers are also achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Triflylpyridinium Enables Rapid and Scalable Controlled Reduction of Carboxylic Acids to Aldehydes using Pinacolborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and scalable synthesis of aldehydes from carboxylic acids is achieved by employing pinacolborane as a reducing agent, in which a triflylpyridinium is used as an activating reagent. Theoretical studies exhibit that the reduction of acylpyridinium requires a lower activation free energy than that of product aldehyde. This method features a wide substrate scope. Flow synthesis and the synthesis of deuterated aldehydes are achieved.







Abstract
Building up new and efficient methods for the controlled conversion of carboxylic acids to aldehydes is important. Herein, we report a rapid, modular and scalable method for the conversion of carboxylic acids to aldehydes using pinacolborane at ambient temperature, in which a triflylpyridinium reagent is used. The conversion of carboxylic acid to intermediate acylpyridinium by triflylpyridinium is new. A binary pyridine&#8208;coordinated boronium complex is generated after reduction. The unprecedented reduction of the acylpyridinium by HBpin opens up a practically direct synthesis of aldehydes from carboxylic acids. Theoretical studies indicate that the reduction of acylpyridinium requires a lower activation free energy than that of the product aldehyde. The synthetic advantage of this protocol is further highlighted by the scalable synthesis of aldehyde via continuous flow process. Configuration retention for chiral acids are presented in those syntheses.

         <title>The Role of Discrepant Reactive Intermediates on Ru&#8208;Ru2P Heterostructure for pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) performance of Ru&#8208;Ru2P/C heterostructure is explored in the whole pH range. Unexpectedly, a non&#8208;monotonous relevance between the HOR activities and the pH of electrolytes is observed. Moreover, its HOR performance under alkaline media is much higher than that in acidic media, highlighting the role of discrepant intermediates for pH&#8208;universal HOR.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) under alkaline media is essential for the commercialization of alkaline exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC). However, the kinetics of HOR in alkaline media is complicated, resulting in orders of magnitude slower than that in acid, even for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C. Here, we find that Ru&#8208;Ru2P/C heterostructure shows HOR performance with a non&#8208;monotonous variation in a whole pH region. Unexpectedly, an inflection point located at pH&#8776;7 is observed, showing an anomalous behavior that HOR activity under alkaline media surpasses acidic media. Combining experimental results and theoretical calculations, we propose the roles of discrepant reactive intermediates for pH&#8208;universal HOR, while H* and H2O* adsorption strengths are responsible for acidic HOR, and OH* adsorption strength is essential for alkaline HOR. This work not only sheds light on fundamentally understanding the mechanism of HOR but also provides new designing principles for pH&#8208;targeted electrocatalysts.

         <title>Synthesis of Twisted [n]Cycloparaphenylene by Alkene Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Mono&#8208;alkene&#8208;inserted [n]cycloparaphenylenes 1 [(ene)&#8208;[n]CPP] with n=6, 8, and 10, mono&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;inserted [6]CPP 2, and di&#8208;alkene&#8208;insertved [n]CPP 3 [(ene)2&#8208;[n]CPP] with n=4, 6, and 8 were synthesized by fusing CPP precursors and alkene or ortho&#8208; phenylene groups through coupling reactions. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal that the strips formed by the &#960;&#8208;surfaces of 1 and 2 exhibited a M&#246;bius topology in the solid state. While the M&#246;bius topology in the parent 1 and 2 in solution was lost due to the free rotation of the paraphenylene unit even at low temperatures, ene&#8208;[6]CPP 4 with eight 1&#8208;pyrrolyl groups preserved the M&#246;bius topology even in solution. Despite a twist, 1 has in&#8208;plane conjugation and possesses a unique size dependence of the electronic properties: namely, the opposite size dependency of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy relative to conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules.

         <title>Fine Pore&#8208;Structure Engineering by Ligand Conformational Control of Naphthalene Diimide&#8208;Based Semiconducting Porous Coordination Polymers for Efficient Chemiresistive Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated 3D naphthalene diimide (NDI) based conductive porous coordination polymers (PCPs) with tunable conductivity and pore structure are developed as chemiresistors for room&#8208;temperature gas sensors. The Zn&#8722;pyNDI can serve as a room&#8208;temperature operable chemiresistive sensor selective to acetone.







Abstract
Exploring new porous coordination polymers (PCPs) that have tunable structure and conductivity is attractive but remains challenging. Herein, fine pore structure engineering by ligand conformation control of naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;based semiconducting PCPs with &#960; stacking&#8208;dependent conductivity tunability is achieved. The &#960; stacking distances and ligand conformation in these isoreticular PCPs were modulated by employing metal centers with different coordination geometries. As a result, three conjugated PCPs (Co&#8722;pyNDI, Ni&#8722;pyNDI, and Zn&#8722;pyNDI) with varying pore structure and conductivity were obtained. Their crystal structures were determined by three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction. The through&#8208;space charge transfer and tunable pore structure in these PCPs result in modulated selectivity and sensitivity in gas sensing. Zn&#8722;pyNDI can serve as a room&#8208;temperature operable chemiresistive sensor selective to acetone.

         <title>A Dynamic Thermodynamic Resolution Strategy for the Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Streptonigrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;standing challenge of preparing P&#8208;streptonigrin with high levels of enantioenrichment has been addressed by the use of an atroposelective dynamic thermodynamic resolution process. The strategy highlights the versatility of organoboron chemistry, as it plays a central role in ring synthesis, atropisomer resolution and functional group installation.







Abstract
We report that axially chiral biaryl boronic esters can be generated with control of atroposelectivity by a Binol&#8208;mediated dynamic thermodynamic resolution process. These intermediates can be progressed to enantioenriched products through stereoretentive functionalization of the carbon&#8211;boron bond. Finally, we have exploited this method in the first highly stereoselective total synthesis of P&#8208;streptonigrin.

&lt;p&gt;The long-standing challenge of preparing &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-streptonigrin with high levels of enantioenrichment has been addressed by the use of an atroposelective dynamic thermodynamic resolution process. The strategy highlights the versatility of organoboron chemistry, as it plays a central role in ring synthesis, atropisomer resolution and functional group installation.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Assisted Coupling Manipulation for Efficient and Stable FAPbI3 Colloidal Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile surface reconfiguration methodology (SRM) is reported for the first time as a general approach to tune the coupling between hybrid FAPbI3 perovskite QDs, which is exploited for improved charge transport for fabricating high&#8208;quality QD arrays and PV devices, leading to a record&#8208;high efficiency approaching 15&#8201;% for FAPbI3 perovskite QD solar cell.







Abstract
For emerging perovskite quantum dots (QDs), understanding the surface features and their impact on the materials and devices is becoming increasingly urgent. In this family, hybrid FAPbI3 QDs (FA: formamidium) exhibit higher ambient stability, near&#8208;infrared absorption and sufficient carrier lifetime. However, hybrid QDs suffer from difficulty in modulating surface ligand, which is essential for constructing conductive QD arrays for photovoltaics. Herein, assisted by an ionic liquid formamidine thiocyanate, we report a facile surface reconfiguration methodology to modulate surface and manipulate electronic coupling of FAPbI3 QDs, which is exploited to enhance charge transport for fabricating high&#8208;quality QD arrays and photovoltaic devices. Finally, a record&#8208;high efficiency approaching 15&#8201;% is achieved for FAPbI3 QD solar cells, and they retain over 80&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after aging in ambient environment (20&#8211;30&#8201;% humidity, 25&#8201;&#176;C) for over 600&#8197;h.

         <title>Mechanoredox Catalysis Enables a Sustainable and Versatile Reversible Addition&#8208;Fragmentation Chain Transfer Polymerization Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling mechanochemistry and single&#8208;electron transfer processes in a ball mill facilitates an efficient reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer polymerization reaction. A versatile mechanoredox process is developed to synthesize macromolecules with good molar mass control. This method serves as an alternative to access complex polymers that may be difficult to access using traditional solution&#8208;state processes.







Abstract
The sustainable synthesis of macromolecules with control over sequence and molar mass remains a challenge in polymer chemistry. By coupling mechanochemistry and electron&#8208;transfer processes (i.e., mechanoredox catalysis), an energy&#8208;conscious controlled radical polymerization methodology is realized. This work explores an efficient mechanoredox reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization process using mechanical stimuli by implementing piezoelectric barium titanate and a diaryliodonium initiator with minimal solvent usage. This mechanoredox RAFT process demonstrates exquisite control over poly(meth)acrylate dispersity and chain length while also showcasing an alternative to the solution&#8208;state synthesis of semifluorinated polymers that typically utilize exotic solvents and/or reagents. This chemistry will find utility in the sustainable development of materials across the energy, biomedical, and engineering communities.

         <title>A Far&#8208;Red Molecular Rotor Fluorogenic Trehalose Probe for Live Mycobacteria Detection and Drug&#8208;Susceptibility Testing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a novel trehalose&#8208;based fluorogenic probe that features a molecular rotor turn&#8208;on fluorophore with exceptionally bright far&#8208;red emission is described (RMR&#8208;Tre). RMR&#8208;Tre enables rapid, no&#8208;wash, low&#8208;background fluorescence detection and drug&#8208;susceptibility evaluation of live mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis.







Abstract
Increasing the speed, specificity, sensitivity, and accessibility of mycobacteria detection tools are important challenges for tuberculosis (TB) research and diagnosis. In this regard, previously reported fluorogenic trehalose analogues have shown potential, but their green&#8208;emitting dyes may limit sensitivity and applications in complex settings. Here, we describe a trehalose&#8208;based fluorogenic probe featuring a molecular rotor turn&#8208;on fluorophore with bright far&#8208;red emission (RMR&#8208;Tre). RMR&#8208;Tre, which exploits the unique biosynthetic enzymes and environment of the mycobacterial outer membrane to achieve fluorescence activation, enables fast, no&#8208;wash, low&#8208;background fluorescence detection of live mycobacteria. Aided by the red&#8208;shifted molecular rotor fluorophore, RMR&#8208;Tre exhibited up to a 100&#8208;fold enhancement in M.&#8197;tuberculosis labeling compared to existing fluorogenic trehalose probes. We show that RMR&#8208;Tre reports on M.&#8197;tuberculosis drug resistance in a facile assay, demonstrating its potential as a TB diagnostic tool.

         <title>Continuous Modulation of Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Activities of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts through p&#8208;n Junction Rectification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A p&#8208;n junction single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) was designed by exploiting the p&#8208;type semiconducting character of the SAC having a metal center coordinated to nitrogen donors. Simply changing the n&#8208;type support material for ones with a different work function allows continuous, controllable modification of the electronic structure and intrinsic activity of catalytically active single&#8208;atom site.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) to surpass their activity limit remains challenging at their atomic scale. Herein, we exploit p&#8208;type semiconducting character of SACs having a metal center coordinated to nitrogen donors (MeNx) and rectify their local charge density by an n&#8208;type semiconductor support. With iron phthalocyanine (FePc) as a model SAC, introducing an n&#8208;type gallium monosulfide that features a low work function generates a space&#8208;charged region across the junction interface, and causes distortion of the FeN4 moiety and spin&#8208;state transition in the FeII center. This catalyst shows an over two&#8208;fold higher specific oxygen&#8208;reduction activity than that of pristine FePc. We further employ three other n&#8208;type metal chalcogenides of varying work function as supports, and discover a linear correlation between the activities of the supported FeN4 and the rectification degrees, which clearly indicates that SACs can be continuously tuned by this rectification strategy.

         <title>Chiral Frustrated Lewis Pair@Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as a New Platform for Heterogeneous Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active heterogeneous chiral frustrated Lewis pair system has been achieved for the first time via incorporating the rationally designed bifunctional chiral FLP molecules into MOF under the guidance of computational studies; the afforded CFLP@MOF demonstrated superb catalysis performances in heterogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation with excellent recyclability/regenerability.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation, a seminal strategy for the synthesis of chiral molecules, remains largely unmet in terms of activation by non&#8208;metal sites of heterogeneous catalysts. Herein, as demonstrated by combined computational and experimental studies, we present a general strategy for integrating rationally designed molecular chiral frustrated Lewis pair (CFLP) with porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) to construct the catalyst CFLP@MOF that can efficiently promote the asymmetric hydrogenation in a heterogeneous manner, which for the first time extends the concept of chiral frustrated Lewis pair from homogeneous system to heterogeneous catalysis. Significantly, the developed CFLP@MOF, inherits the merits of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, with high activity/enantio&#8208;selectivity and excellent recyclability/regenerability. Our work not only advances CFLP@MOF as a new platform for heterogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation, but also opens a new avenue for the design and preparation of advanced catalysts for asymmetric catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;A highly active heterogeneous chiral frustrated Lewis pair system has been achieved for the first time via incorporating the rationally designed bifunctional chiral FLP molecules into MOF under the guidance of computational studies; the afforded CFLP@MOF demonstrated superb catalysis performances in heterogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation with excellent recyclability/regenerability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric hydrogenation, a seminal strategy for the synthesis of chiral molecules, remains largely unmet in terms of activation by non-metal sites of heterogeneous catalysts. Herein, as demonstrated by combined computational and experimental studies, we present a general strategy for integrating rationally designed molecular chiral frustrated Lewis pair (CFLP) with porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) to construct the catalyst CFLP@MOF that can efficiently promote the asymmetric hydrogenation in a heterogeneous manner, which for the first time extends the concept of chiral frustrated Lewis pair from homogeneous system to heterogeneous catalysis. Significantly, the developed CFLP@MOF, inherits the merits of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, with high activity/enantio-selectivity and excellent recyclability/regenerability. Our work not only advances CFLP@MOF as a new platform for heterogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation, but also opens a new avenue for the design and preparation of advanced catalysts for asymmetric catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>sn&#8208;1&#160;Specificity of Lysophosphatidylcholine Acyltransferase&#8208;1 Revealed by a Mass Spectrometry&#8208;based Assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase&#8208;1 (LPCAT1) plays a critical role in the remodeling of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) in cellular lipidome. However, evidence is scarce regarding its&#160;sn&#8208;selectivity, viz. the preference of assembling acyl&#8208;Coenzyme A (CoA) at the C1 or C2&#8208;hydroxyl on a glycerol backbone because of difficulty to quantify the thus&#8208;formed PC&#160;sn&#8208;isomers. We have established a multiplexed assay to measure both&#160;sn&#8208; and acyl&#8208;chain selectivity of LPCAT1 toward a mixture of acyl&#8208;CoAs by integrating isomer&#8208;resolving tandem mass spectrometry. Our findings reveal that LPCAT1 shows exclusive&#160;sn&#8208;1 specificity regardless of the identity of acyl&#8208;CoAs. We further confirm that elevated PC 18:1/16:0 relative to its&#160;sn&#8208;isomer results from an increased expression of LPCAT1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue as compared to normal liver tissue. MS imaging via desorption electrospray ionization of PC 18:1/16:0 thus enables&#160;visualization&#160;of HCC margins in human liver tissue at a molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Dilution Analysis Facilitates Aptamer Binding Characterization at the&#160;Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell&#8208;specific aptamers offer a powerful tool to study membrane receptors at the single&#8208;molecule level. Most target receptors of aptamers are highly expressed on the cell surface, but difficult to analyze in situ because of dense distribution and fast velocity. Therefore, we herein propose a random sampling&#8208;based analysis strategy termed ligand dilution analysis (LDA) for easily implemented aptamer&#8208;based receptor study. Receptor density on the cell surface can be calculated based on a regression model. By using a synergistic ligand dilution design, colocalization and differentiation of aptamer and monoclonal antibody (mAb) binding on a single receptor can be realized. Once this is accomplished, precise binding site and detailed aptamer&#8208;receptor binding mode can be further determined using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The ligand dilution strategy also sets the stage for an aptamer&#8208;based dynamics analysis of two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional motion and fluctuation of highly expressed receptors on the live cell membrane.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;Dissolved Isostructural Polyoxovanadates to Construct Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Site Catalysts for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We explored a co&#8208;dissolved strategy to embed mono&#8208;dispersed Pt center into V2O5 support via dissolving [PtV9O28]7&#8208; into [V10O28]6&#8208; aqueous solution. The uniform dispersion of [PtV9O28]7&#8208; in [V10O28]6&#8208; solution allows [PtV9O28]7&#8208; to be surrounded by [V10O28]6&#8208; clusters via a freeze&#8208;drying process. The V centers in both [PtV9O28]7&#8208; and [V10O28]6&#8208; were converted into V2O5 via a calcination process to stabilize Pt center. These double separations can effectively prevent the Pt center agglomeration during the high&#8208;temperature conversion process, and achieve 100% utilization of Pt in [PtV9O28]7&#8208;. The resulting Pt&#8208;V2O5 single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts exhibit a CH4 yield of 247.6 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, 25 times higher than that of Pt nanoparticle on the V2O5 support, which was accompanied by the lactic acid photooxidation to form pyruvic acid. Systematical investigations on this unambiguous structure demonstrate an important role of Pt&#8208;O atomic pair synergy for highly efficient CO2 photoreduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Morphology Optimization of the Photoactive Layer through Crystallinity and Miscibility Regulation for High&#8208;performance Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On the premise of strongly crystalline materials involved, it is a challenge to control the phase separation of bulk&#8208;heterojunction donor/acceptor active layer to fabricate high&#8208;performance polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we develop a molecular design strategy of the third component to synthesize three guest materials (namely BTPT, BTP&#8208;Th, and BTP&#8208;2Th) to address this issue. We investigate and reveal the effect of crystallinity and miscibility of the third component in controlling the phase separation of Y6&#8208;derivatives&#8208;based blend film. As a result, a remarkable power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 18.53% is obtained in the ternary PSC based on PTQ10:m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6 with BTP&#8208;Th as the third component, which is a significant improvement with regard to the efficiency of 17.22% for the control binary device. Our study offers a molecular design strategy to develop a third component for building ternary PSCs in terms of crystallinity and miscibility regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Pore Geometry and Surface Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Anhydrous Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new materials for anhydrous proton conduction under high&#8208;temperature conditions is of great significance and challenging. Herein, we create a series of highly crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) via a pore engineering approach. We simultaneously engineer the pore geometry (generating concave dodecagonal nanopores) and pore surface (installing multiple functional groups such as &#8208;C=N&#8208;, &#8208;OH, &#8208;N=N&#8208; and &#8208;CF3) to improve the utilization efficiency and host&#8208;guest interaction of proton carriers, hence benefiting the enhancement of anhydrous proton conduction. Upon loading with H3PO4, COFs can realize a proton conductivity of 2.33&#215;10&#8208;2 S cm&#8208;1 under anhydrous conditions, among the highest values of all COF materials. These materials demonstrate good stability and maintain high proton conductivity over a wide temperature range (80&#8208;160 &#176;C). This work paves a new way for designing COFs for anhydrous proton conduction applications, which shows great potential as high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 Cathode Catalysts for Hydrogen Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To achieve practical application of fuel cell, it is vital to develop highly efficient and durable Pt&#8208;free catalysts. Herein, we prepare atomically dispersed ZnNC catalysts with Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 moieties and abundant mesoporous structure. The ZnNC&#8208;based anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) presents an ultrahigh peak power density of 1.63 and 0.83 W cm&#8208;2 in H2&#8208;O2 and H2&#8208;air (CO2&#8208;free), and also exhibits long&#8208;term stability with more than 120 and 100 h for H2&#8208;air (CO2&#8208;free) and H2&#8208;O2, respectively. Density functional calculations further unveil that the Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 structure is the origin of high activity of as&#8208;synthesized ZnNC catalyst, while the Zn&#8208;Pyridinic&#8208;N4 moiety is inactive for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which successfully explain the puzzle why most Zn&#8208;metal&#8208;organic framework &#8208;derived ZnNC catalysts in previous reports did not present good ORR activity because of their Zn&#8208;Pyridinic&#8208;N4 moieties. This work offers a new route for speeding up development of AEMFCs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Telomerase&#8208;Assisted Strategy for Regeneration of DNA Nanomachines in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA nanomachines have been engineered into diverse personalized devices for diagnostic imaging of biomarkers; however, the regeneration of DNA nanomachines in living cells remains challenging. Here, we report an ingenious DNA nanomachine that can implement telomerase (TE)&#8208;activated regeneration in living cells. Upon apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1)&#8208;responsive initiation of the nanomachine, the walker of the nanomachine moves along tracks regenerated by TE, generating multiply amplified signals through which APE1 can be imaged in situ. Additionally, augmentation of the signal due to the regeneration of the nanomachines could reveal differential expression of TE in different cell lines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the use of biomarkers to assist in the regeneration of nanomachines in living cells. This study offers a new paradigm for the development of more applicable and efficient DNA nanomachines.</dc:description>

         <title>High Power&#8208; and Energy&#8208;Density Supercapacitors through the Chlorine Respiration Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an unprecedentedly high power&#8208; and energy&#8208;density supercapacitor through the chlorine respiration in porous carbon materials. Both electrochemical results and theoretical calculations show that porous carbon with pore size around 3&#8197;nm delivers the best chlorine evolution and adsorption performance.







Abstract
Supercapacitor represents an important electrical energy storage technology with high&#8208;power performance and superior cyclability. However, currently commercialized supercapacitors still suffer limited energy densities. Here we report an unprecedentedly respiring supercapacitor with chlorine gas iteratively re&#8208;inspires in porous carbon materials, that improves the energy density by orders of magnitude. Both electrochemical results and theoretical calculations show that porous carbon with pore size around 3&#8197;nm delivers the best chlorine evolution and adsorption performance. The respiring supercapacitor with multi&#8208;wall carbon nanotube as the cathode and NaTi2(PO4)3 as the anode can store specific energy of 33&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with negligible capacity loss over 30&#8201;000 cycles. The energy density can be further improved to 53&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 by replacing NaTi2(PO4)3 with zinc anode. Furthermore, thanks to the extraordinary reaction kinetics of chlorine gas, this respiring supercapacitor performs an extremely high&#8208;power density of 50&#8201;000&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Unlocking Charge Transfer Limitations for Extreme Fast Charging of Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extreme fast charging of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries is achieved by simultaneously reducing the anode and cathode charge transfer energy barriers through electrolyte engineering. Ah&#8208;level commercial cells demonstrate rapid charging from 0 to 80&#8201;% state of charge (SOC) within 10 to 25&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
Extreme fast charging (XFC) of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries is a key enabler of electrified transportation. While previous studies mainly focused on improving Li ion mass transport in electrodes and electrolytes, the limitations of charge transfer across electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces remain underexplored. Herein we unravel how charge transfer kinetics dictates the fast rechargeability of Li&#8208;ion cells. Li ion transfer across the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface is found to be rate&#8208;limiting during XFC, but the charge transfer energy barrier at both the cathode and anode have to be reduced simultaneously to prevent Li plating, which is achieved through electrolyte engineering. By unlocking charge transfer limitations, 184&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 pouch cells demonstrate stable XFC (10&#8208;min charge to 80&#8201;%) which is otherwise unachievable, and the lifetime of 245&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 21700 cells is quintupled during fast charging (25&#8208;min charge to 80&#8201;%).

         <title>An Infectious Virus&#8208;like Particle Built on a Programmable Icosahedral DNA Framework
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de&#8208;novo designed rigid icosahedral DNA framework was assembled to efficiently package single&#8208;stranded phage genome inside it. The packaging behavior was precisely regulated and systematically investigated. The entrapped ssDNA was available for molecular operations due to the structure&#8216;s permeability. Moreover, the phage mimetic particle could passively infect host bacteria and induce phage plaque.







Abstract
Viral genomes can be compressed into a near&#8208;spherical nanochamber to form infectious particles. In order to mimic the virus morphology and packaging behavior, we invented a programmable icosahedral DNA nanoframe with enhanced rigidity and encapsulated the phiX174 bacteriophage genome. The packaging efficiency could be modulated through specific anchoring strands adjustment, and the trapped phage genome remained accessible for enzymatic operations. Moreover, the packed complex could infect Escherichia coli (E.&#8197;coli) cells through bacterial uptake to produce plaques. This rigid icosahedral DNA architecture demonstrated a versatile platform to develop virus mimetic particles for convenient functional nucleic acid entrapment, manipulation and delivery.

         <title>Electrophoresis&#8208;Assisted Multilayer Assembly of Nanoparticles for Sensitive Lateral Flow Immunoassay
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a universal approach for reducing the limit of detection of lateral flow immunoassay. This approach utilizes electrophoresis&#8208;driven migration of biotin&#8208; and streptavidin&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles for layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of aggregates directly on the test strip. As a result, a 60&#8208;times lower limit of detection of hepatitis B antigen is achieved.







Abstract
Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is a rapid, simple, and inexpensive point&#8208;of&#8208;need method. A major limitation of LFIA is a high limit of detection (LOD), which impacts its diagnostic sensitivity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a signal&#8208;enhancement procedure that is performed after completing LFIA and involves controllably moving biotin&#8208; and streptavidin&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticles by electrophoresis. The nanoparticles link to immunocomplexes forming multilayer aggregates on the test strip, thus, enhancing the signal. Here, we demonstrate lowering the LOD of hepatitis B surface antigen from approximately 8 to 0.12&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1, making it clinically acceptable. Testing 118 clinical samples for hepatitis B showed that signal enhancement increased the diagnostic sensitivity of LFIA from 73&#8201;% to 98&#8201;% while not affecting its 95&#8201;% specificity. Electrophoresis&#8208;driven enhancement of LFIA is universal (antigen&#8208;independent), takes two minutes, and can be performed by an untrained person.

     alt="Electrophoresis-Assisted Multilayer Assembly of Nanoparticles for Sensitive Lateral Flow Immunoassay**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a universal approach for reducing the limit of detection of lateral flow immunoassay. This approach utilizes electrophoresis-driven migration of biotin- and streptavidin-modified gold nanoparticles for layer-by-layer assembly of aggregates directly on the test strip. As a result, a 60-times lower limit of detection of hepatitis B antigen is achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is a rapid, simple, and inexpensive point-of-need method. A major limitation of LFIA is a high limit of detection (LOD), which impacts its diagnostic sensitivity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a signal-enhancement procedure that is performed after completing LFIA and involves controllably moving biotin- and streptavidin-functionalized gold nanoparticles by electrophoresis. The nanoparticles link to immunocomplexes forming multilayer aggregates on the test strip, thus, enhancing the signal. Here, we demonstrate lowering the LOD of hepatitis B surface antigen from approximately 8 to 0.12&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, making it clinically acceptable. Testing 118 clinical samples for hepatitis B showed that signal enhancement increased the diagnostic sensitivity of LFIA from 73&#8201;% to 98&#8201;% while not affecting its 95&#8201;% specificity. Electrophoresis-driven enhancement of LFIA is universal (antigen-independent), takes two minutes, and can be performed by an untrained person.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereodivergent Construction of Csp3&#8722;Csp3 Bonds Bearing Vicinal Stereocenters by Synergistic Palladium and Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereodivergent Csp3&#8722;Csp3 coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes with oxindoles was achieved by synergizing a palladium and a chiral phase&#8208;transfer catalyst in a biphasic system. Both the syn and anti products, which have vicinal quaternary and tertiary stereocenters, could be selectively achieved in good yields with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. This is the first stereodivergent synthesis via metal/phase&#8208;transfer catalysis.







Abstract
Synergistic catalysis has emerged as one of the most powerful tools for stereodivergent formation of Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bonds bearing vicinal stereocenters. Despite the many successes that have been achieved in this field, stereodivergent Csp3&#8722;Csp3 coupling reactions involving stabilized nucleophiles remain challenging because of the competing single&#8208;catalysis pathway. Herein, we report a synergistic palladium/phase&#8208;transfer catalyst system that enables diastereodivergent Csp3&#8722;Csp3 coupling reactions of 1,3&#8208;dienes with stabilized nucleophile oxindoles. Both the syn and anti coupling products, bearing quaternary and tertiary vicinal stereocenters, could be selectively produced in good yields with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Non&#8208;covalent activation of the stabilized nucleophile via chiral ion pair in a biphasic system is a crucial success factor in achieving diastereodivergence.

         <title>Kinetics Driven by Hollow Nanoreactors: An Opportunity for Controllable Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of hollow nanoreactors offers new opportunities for developing controllable catalysis. This Review presents the basic context of hollow nanoreactors, the underlying theory of hollow nanoreactor&#8208;driven kinetics, and the structure&#8211;performance relation for kinetics within hollow nanoreactors. The proposed perspectives may contribute to further theoretical innovations in controllable catalysis.







Abstract
As a novel class of catalytic materials, hollow nanoreactors offer new opportunities for improving catalytic performance owing to their higher controllability on molecular kinetic behavior. Nevertheless, to achieve controllable catalysis with specific purposes, the catalytic mechanism occurring inside hollow nanoreactors remains to be further understood. In this context, this Review presents a focused discussion about the basic concept of hollow nanoreactors, the underlying theory for hollow nanoreactor&#8208;driven kinetics, and the intrinsic correlation between key structural parameters of hollow nanoreactors and molecular kinetic behaviors. We aim to provide in&#8208;depth insights into understanding kinetics occurred within typical hollow nanoreactors. The perspectives proposed in this paper may contribute to the development of the fundamental theoretical framework of hollow nanoreactor&#8208;driven catalysis.

         <title>Negligible Ion Migration in Tin&#8208;Based and Tin&#8208;Doped Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion migration in tin&#8208;halide perovskites is investigated with a full range of bromide ratios under light illumination or electric field. The migration in these systems is negligible compared to lead&#8208;halide perovskites owing to a higher ion migration activation energy (Ea). Using mixed lead&#8208;tin perovskites with different Ea, the threshold Ea for observation of ion migration in perovskite devices is determined to be around 0.65&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Ion migration is a notorious phenomenon observed in ionic perovskite materials. It causes several severe issues in perovskite optoelectronic devices such as instability, current hysteresis, and phase segregation. Here, we report that, in contrast to lead halide perovskites (LHPs), no ion migration or phase segregation was observed in tin halide perovskites (THPs) under illumination or an electric field. The origin is attributed to a much stronger Sn&#8208;halide bond and higher ion migration activation energy (Ea) in THPs, which remain nearly constant under illumination. We further figured out the threshold Ea for the absence of ion migration to be around 0.65&#8197;eV using the CsSnyPb1&#8208;y(I0.6Br0.4)3 system whose Ea varies with Sn ratios. Our work shows that ion migration does not necessarily exist in all perovskites and suggests metallic doping to be a promising way of stopping ion migration and improving the intrinsic stability of perovskites.

         <title>Darobactins Exhibiting Superior Antibiotic Activity by Cryo&#8208;EM Structure Guided Biosynthetic Engineering
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural evaluation of the Bam complex with darobactin 9 using cryo&#8208;EM combined with bioactivity evaluation led to biosynthetic engineering of novel derivatives with enhanced activity against Gram&#8208;negative pathogens, including clinically relevant isolates. The currently most promising derivative darobactin 22 verified the structure and activity guided approach, exhibiting up to 128&#8208;fold increased activity compared to natural darobactin A.







Abstract
Over recent decades, the pipeline of antibiotics acting against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria is running dry, as most discovered candidate antibiotics suffer from insufficient potency, pharmacokinetic properties, or toxicity. The darobactins, a promising new small peptide class of drug candidates, bind to novel antibiotic target BamA, an outer membrane protein. Previously, we reported that biosynthetic engineering in a heterologous host generated novel darobactins with enhanced antibacterial activity. Here we utilize an optimized purification method and present cryo&#8208;EM structures of the Bam complex with darobactin 9 (D9), which served as a blueprint for the biotechnological generation of twenty new darobactins including halogenated analogs. The newly engineered darobactin 22 binds more tightly to BamA and outperforms the favorable activity profile of D9 against clinically relevant pathogens such as carbapenem&#8208;resistant Acinetobacter baumannii up to 32&#8208;fold, without observing toxic effects.

         <title>Structural Evolution of Anatase&#8208;Supported Platinum Nanoclusters into a Platinum&#8208;Titanium Intermetallic Containing Platinum Single Atoms for Enhanced Catalytic CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt clusters of 1.5&#8197;nm supported on anatase TiO2 transform exclusively into CsCl&#8208;type PtTi intermetallic compound particles that grow epitaxially along the TiO2 (101) planes after H2 reduction at 700&#8201;&#176;C. The formation of PtTi occurs through migration of reduced metallic Ti atoms into Pt clusters. The thermally stable PtTi intermetallic exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and promoted catalytic durability for CO oxidation.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interactions characteristic of the encapsulation of metal particles by oxide overlayers have been widely observed on large metal nanoparticles, but scarcely occur on small nanoclusters (&lt;2&#8197;nm) for which the metal&#8208;support interactions remain elusive. Herein, we study the structural evolution of Pt nanoclusters (1.5&#8197;nm) supported on anatase TiO2 upon high&#8208;temperature H2 reduction. The Pt nanoclusters start to partially evolve into a CsCl&#8208;type PtTi intermetallic compound when the reduction temperature reaches 400&#8201;&#176;C. Upon 700&#8201;&#176;C reduction, the PtTi nanoparticles are exclusively formed and grow epitaxially along the TiO2 (101) crystal faces. The thermodynamics of the formation of PtTi via migration of reduced Ti atoms into Pt cluster is unraveled by theoretical calculations. The thermally stable PtTi intermetallic compound, with single&#8208;atom Pt isolated by Ti, exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and promoted catalytic durability for CO oxidation.

         <title>Mixed Matrix Membrane with Penetrating Subnanochannels: A Versatile Nanofluidic Platform for Selective Metal Ion Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the unique structure of cell membranes, a mixed&#8208;matrix membrane (MMM) with penetrating subnanochannels was developed based on a soft&#8208;substrate assisted solution casting method for selective conduction of monovalent metal ions. Thanks to the diversity of nanoporous materials and polymer matrix, we expect that the penetrating MMMs could be developed into a versatile nanofluidic platform and offer new possibilities for practical applications.







Abstract
Biological ion channels penetrated through cell membrane form unique transport pathways for selective ionic conductance. Replicating the success of ion selectivity with mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) will enable new separation technologies but remains challenging. Herein, we report a soft substrate&#8208;assisted solution casting method to develop MMMs with penetrating subnanochannels for selective metal ion conduction. The MMMs are composed of penetrating Prussian white (PW) microcubes with subnanochannels in dense polyimide (PI) matrices, achieving selective monovalent metal ion conduction. The ion selectivity of K+/Mg2+ is up to 14.0, and the ion conductance of K+ can reach 45.5&#8197;&#956;S with the testing diameter of 5&#8197;mm, which can be further improved by increasing the testing area. Given the diversity of nanoporous materials and polymer matrices, we expect that the MMMs with penetrating subnanochannels could be developed into a versatile nanofluidic platform for various emerging applications.

         <title>Combining Deep Eutectic Solvents with TEMPO&#8208;based Polymer Electrodes: Influence of Molar Ratio on Electrode Performance
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable battery technology: The combination of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) with TEMPO&#8208;based electrodes opens a new way to environmentally friendly energy storage in all&#8208;organic batteries. Especially the eutectic mixture of the DES composed of sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and N&#8208;methylacetamide enables stable and efficient cycling of the polymer electrodes.







Abstract
For sustainable energy storage, all&#8208;organic batteries based on redox&#8208;active polymers promise to become an alternative to lithium ion batteries. Yet, polymers contribute to the goal of an all&#8208;organic cell as electrodes or as solid electrolytes. Here, we replace the electrolyte with a deep eutectic solvent (DES) composed of sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI) and N&#8208;methylacetamide (NMA), while using poly(2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;oxyl methacrylate) (PTMA) as cathode. The successful combination of a DES with a polymer electrode is reported here for the first time. The electrochemical stability of PTMA electrodes in the DES at the eutectic molar ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;6 is comparable to conventional battery electrolytes. More viscous electrolytes with higher salt concentration can hinder cycling at high rates. Lower salt concentration leads to decreasing capacities and faster decomposition. The eutectic mixture of 1&#8201;:&#8201;6 is best suited uniting high stability and moderate viscosity.

         <title>Aggregation of Electrochemically Active Conjugated Organic Molecules and Its Impact on Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox organic molecule features reversible redox&#8208;tuned discrete&#8208;aggregate conversion in solution. The resultant aggregation&#8208;regulated electrochemistry (ARE) offers a new mechanism to optimize the flow battery's performance.







Abstract
Molecule aggregation in solution is acknowledged to be universal and can regulate the molecule's physiochemical properties, which however has been rarely investigated in electrochemistry. Herein, an electrochemical method is developed to quantitatively study the aggregation behavior of the target molecule methyl viologen dichloride. It is found that the oxidation state dicationic ions stay discrete, while the singly&#8208;reduced state monoradicals yield a concentration&#8208;dependent aggregation behavior. As a result, the molecule's energy level and its redox potential can be effectively regulated. This work does not only provide a method to investigate the molecular aggregation, but also demonstrates the feasibility to tune redox flow battery's performance by regulating the aggregation behavior.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Peptidyl Aggregates for the Fluorogenic Recognition of Mitochondrial DNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled peptidyl fluorogenic probe (CV2) able to selectively light&#8208;up parallel G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA over other topologies is presented. CV2 allows for the staining of G4s in mitochondria over the nucleus in living cells, and is further employed for tracking the folding and unfolding of G4s in living cells, and for monitoring mitochondrial DNA damage.







Abstract
The selective monitoring of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures in living cells is important to elucidate their functions and reveal their value as diagnostic or therapeutic targets. Here we report a fluorogenic probe (CV2) able to selectively light&#8208;up parallel G4 DNA over antiparallel topologies. CV2 was constructed by conjugating the excimer&#8208;forming CV dye with a peptide sequence (l&#8208;Arg&#8208;l&#8208;Gly&#8208;glutaric acid) that specifically recognizes G4s. CV2 forms self&#8208;assembled, red excimer&#8208;emitting nanoaggregates in aqueous media, but specific binding to G4s triggers its disassembly into rigidified monomeric dyes, leading to a dramatic fluorescence enhancement. Moreover, selective permeation of CV2 stains G4s in mitochondria over the nucleus. CV2 was employed for tracking the folding and unfolding of G4s in living cells, and for monitoring mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. These properties make CV2 appealing to investigate the possible roles of mtDNA G4s in diseases that involve mitochondrial dysfunction.

         <title>NMR and DFT Studies with a Doubly Labelled 15N/6Li S&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Sulfoximine Reveal Why a Directed ortho&#8208;Lithiation Requires an Excess of n&#8208;BuLi</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NMR study was able to clearly explain why an excess of base is needed to deprotonate the aromatic ring of a S&#8208;trifluoromethylsulfoximine, thanks in particular to the identification and characterization of all the aggregates present in the medium.







Abstract
This work shows why it is imperious to use an excess of butyllithium for a directed ortho&#8208;lithiation of a trifluoromethyl sulfoximine. The analysis of mixtures of n&#8208;BuLi and sulfoximine 1 in THF&#8208;d8 using {1H, 6Li, 13C, 15N, 19F} NMR experiments at low temperatures reveal that a first deprotonation occurs that leads to dimeric and tetrameric N&#8208;lithiated sulfoximine (93&#8201;:&#8201;7). Using an excess n&#8208;BuLi (5&#8197;equivalents), the second deprotonation on the ortho&#8208;position of the aromatic occurs. Six species were observed and characterized on the way. It includes three aggregates involving a sulfoximine: i)&#8197;a [dilithiated sulfoximine/(n&#8208;BuLi)] dimer solvated by four molecules of THF (Agg2, 39&#8201;%); ii)&#8197;a [dilithiated sulfoximine/(n&#8208;BuLi)3] tetramer solvated by six molecules of THF (Agg3, 39&#8201;%); iii)&#8197;a [dilithiated sulfoximine/(n&#8208;BuOLi)3] tetramer solvated by four molecules of THF (Agg1, 22&#8201;%). A DFT study afforded optimized solvated structures for all these aggregates, fully consistent with the NMR data.

         <title>Toward Precise Antitumoral Photodynamic Therapy Using a Dual Receptor&#8208;Mediated Bioorthogonal Activation Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The internalization of two bioorthogonal components mediated by the corresponding receptors, followed by inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction leads to specific activation of the photodynamic action inside the target cells. This dual receptor&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal activation approach works as an AND logic device that can greatly enhance the precision of antitumoral photodynamic therapy.Dedicated to Prof. Tom&#225;s Torres on the occasion of his 70th birthday







Abstract
Targeted delivery and specific activation of photosensitizers can greatly improve the treatment outcome of photodynamic therapy. To this end, we report herein a novel dual receptor&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal activation approach to enhance the tumor specificity of the photodynamic action. It involves the targeted delivery of a biotinylated boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based photosensitizer, which is quenched in the native form by the attached 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine unit, and an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#8208;targeting cyclic peptide conjugated with a bicycle[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne moiety. Only for cancer cells that overexpress both the biotin receptor and EGFR, the two components can be internalized preferentially where they undergo an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, leading to restoration of the photodynamic activity of the BODIPY core. By using a range of cell lines with different expression levels of these two receptors, we have demonstrated that this stepwise &#8220;deliver&#8208;and&#8208;click&#8221; approach can confine the photodynamic action on a specific type of cancer cells.

         <title>Highly Luminescent One&#8208;Dimensional Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Double&#8208;Perovskite&#8208;Inspired Materials for Single&#8208;Component Warm White&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on a new class of 1D double perovskite&#8208;inspired materials (DFPD)2MIInBr6 (DFPD=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium, MI=K+ and Rb+), which exhibit an intrinsic warm&#8208;white light emission. Further enhancement is achieved by 0.3&#8201;% Sb3+ doping, which boosts PLQY to &#8776;92&#8201;%. Warm white light&#8208;emitting diodes based on single component (DFPD)2KInBr6:Sb are fabricated.







Abstract
Double perovskites (DPs) are one of the most promising candidates for developing white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) owing to their intrinsic broadband emission from self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs). Translation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) DPs to one&#8208;dimensional (1D) analogues, which could break the octahedral tolerance factor limit, is so far remaining unexplored. Herein, by employing a fluorinated organic cation, we report a series of highly luminescent 1D DP&#8208;inspired materials, (DFPD)2MIInBr6 (DFPD=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium, MI=K+ and Rb+). Highly efficient warm&#8208;white photoluminescence quantum yield of 92&#8201;% is achieved by doping 0.3&#8201;% Sb3+ in (DFPD)2KInBr6. Furthermore, single&#8208;component warm&#8208;WLEDs fabricated with (DFPD)2KInBr6:Sb yield a luminance of 300 cd/m2, which is one of the best&#8208;performing lead&#8208;free metal&#8208;halides WLEDs reported so far. Our study expands the scope of In&#8208;based metal&#8208;halides from 3D to 1D, which exhibit superior optical performances and broad application prospects.

         <title>Regulating the Mechanical and Optical Properties of Polymer&#8208;based Nanocomposites by Sub&#8208;Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By simple mixing of hydroxyapatite sub&#8208;nanowires (HAP SNWs) and polyimide (PI), hydroxyapatite sub&#8208;nanowires/polyimide (HSP) gels displayed high viscosity and modulus. HSP films showed high transparency, regulable haze, and enhanced Young's modulus.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanowires (SNWs) exhibit great potential applications in nanocomposites owing to their high specific surface area, high flexibility, and similarity to polymer chains in dimension, which are a good entry point to bridge inorganic materials and polymer materials. Herein, we synthesized hydroxyapatite sub&#8208;nanowires (HAP SNWs) and engineered hydroxyapatite sub&#8208;nanowires/polyimide (HSP) gels and films by simple mixing of HAP SNWs and polyimide (PI). Benefiting from the interactions between HAP SNWs and PI, these nanocomposites were a continuous hybrid network. As the increase of HAP SNWs contents, the viscosity and modulus of HSP gels were greatly improved by one or two orders of magnitude compared with PI gel. HSP films not only maintained high transparency but also gained high haze, as well as exhibited enhanced Young's modulus. Thus, both HSP gels and films developed in this work are promising for various applications in coatings and high&#8208;performance films.

         <title>Off&#8208;center Mechanophore Activation in Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atypical force distribution along block copolymers (BCP) chains is seen when these are mechanically stressed. Mechanophores are more efficiently activated in a segment in a BCP that is far from the chain center than when in a fully loaded multi&#8208;mechanophore homopolymer.







Abstract
Block copolymers (BCPs) are used in numerous applications in modern materials science. Yet, like homopolymers, BCPs can undergo covalent bond scission when mechanically stressed (mechanochemistry), which could lead to unexpected consequences in such applications. BCPs&#8217; heterogeneity may affect force transduction, perhaps changing force distribution and localization. To verify this, a gem&#8208;dichlorocyclopropane (gDCC) embedded linear chain is prepared and extended with a poly(methyl methacrylate) block. When stressed in solution, the mechanochemical ring&#8208;opening of gDCC is accelerated compared to homopolymers, even though the mechanophores are at the chain ends. Moreover, a higher mechanophore activation selectivity is obtained. These results indicate that mechanochemical response outside, and even far from the chain center is quite prominent in BCPs, and that forces along the polymer chain can efficiently activate multi&#8208;mechanophores regions, even when far from the polymer midchain.

     alt="Off-center Mechanophore Activation in Block Copolymers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An atypical force distribution along block copolymers (BCP) chains is seen when these are mechanically stressed. Mechanophores are more efficiently activated in a segment in a BCP that is far from the chain center than when in a fully loaded multi-mechanophore homopolymer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block copolymers (BCPs) are used in numerous applications in modern materials science. Yet, like homopolymers, BCPs can undergo covalent bond scission when mechanically stressed (mechanochemistry), which could lead to unexpected consequences in such applications. BCPs&#8217; heterogeneity may affect force transduction, perhaps changing force distribution and localization. To verify this, a &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-dichlorocyclopropane (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;DCC) embedded linear chain is prepared and extended with a poly(methyl methacrylate) block. When stressed in solution, the mechanochemical ring-opening of &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;DCC is accelerated compared to homopolymers, even though the mechanophores are at the chain ends. Moreover, a higher mechanophore activation selectivity is obtained. These results indicate that mechanochemical response outside, and even far from the chain center is quite prominent in BCPs, and that forces along the polymer chain can efficiently activate multi-mechanophores regions, even when far from the polymer midchain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic Perturbation of Cu Single&#8208;Atom CO2 Reduction Catalysts in a Molecular Way</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fine&#8208;tuning electronic structures of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) plays a crucial role in harnessing their catalytic activities, yet challenges remain at a molecular scale in a controlled fashion. By tailoring the structure of graphdiyne (GDY) with electron&#8208;withdrawing/&#8208;donating groups, we show herein the electronic perturbation of Cu single&#8208;atom CO2 reduction catalysts in a molecular way. The elaborately introduced functional groups (&#8211;F, &#8211;H and &#8211;OMe) can regulate the valance state of Cu&#948;+, which is found to be directly scaled with the selectivity of the electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion. An optimum CH4 Faradic efficiency of 72.3% was achieved over the Cu SAC on the F&#8208;substituted GDY. In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations revealed that the positive Cu&#948;+ centers adjusted by the electron&#8208;withdrawing group decrease the pKa of adsorbed H2O, promoting the hydrogenation of intermediates toward the CH4 production. Our strategy paves the way to precise electronic perturbation of SACs toward efficient electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting the Activity of Pd Single Atoms by Tuning Their Local Environment on Ceria for Methane Combustion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported Pd single atom catalysts (SACs) have triggered great research interest in methane combustion yet with contradicting views on their activity and stability. Here, we show that the Pd SAs can take different electronic structure and atomic geometry on ceria support, resulting in different catalytic properties. By a simple thermal pretreatment to ceria prior to Pd deposition, a unique anchoring site is created. The Pd SA, taking this site, can be activated to Pd&#948;+ (0 &lt; &#948; &lt; 2) that has greatly enhanced activity for methane oxidation: T50 lowered by up to 130 oC and almost 10 times higher turnover frequency compared to the untreated catalyst. The enhanced activity of Pd&#948;+ site is related to its oxygen&#8208;deficient local structure and elongated interacting distance with ceria, leading to enhanced capability in delivering reactive oxygen species and decomposing reaction intermediates. This work provides insights into designing highly efficient Pd SACs for oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;valent MxAl3 cluster salts with tetrahedral [SiAl3]+ and trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal [M2Al3]2+ cores (M = Si/Ge)</title>

Despite the isoelectronic relationship between the AlCp* and the [SiCp*]+ fragments, their mutual reactivity is hitherto unknown. Here, we report on their reaction giving the complex salts [SiCp*(AlCp*)3][WCA] ([WCA] = [Al(ORF)4] and [F{Al(ORF)3}2]; RF = C(CF3)3). The [SiAl3]+ tetrahedron not only represents a rare example of a low&#8208;valent silicon&#8208;doped aluminium cluster core, but also &#8211; due to its facile accessibility and high stability &#8211; provides a convenient preparative entry towards low&#8208;valent Si&#8211;Al clusters in general. For example, an elusive binuclear [Si2(AlCp*)5]2+ with extremely short Al&#8211;Si bonds and a high negative partial charge at the Si atom was structurally characterised and its bonding situation analysed by DFT. Crystals of the isostructural [Ge2(AlCp*)5]2+ dication were also obtained and represent the first mixed Al&#8211;Ge cluster.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Catenane&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rotaxanes and molecular knots exhibit particular properties resulting from the presence of a mechanical bond within their structure that maintains the molecular components interlocked in a permanent manner. On the other hand, the disassembly of the interlocked architecture via the breakdown of the mechanical bond can activate properties which are masked in the parent compound. Herein, we present the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive Cu(I)&#8208;complexed [2]catenanes as OFF/ON catalysts for the copper&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction. The encapsulation of the Cu(I) ion inside the [2]catenanes inhibits its ability to catalyse the formation of triazoles. In contrast, the controlled opening of the two macrocycles induces the breaking of the mechanical bond, thereby restoring the catalytic activity of the Cu(I) for the CuAAC reaction. Such OFF/ON catalysts can be involved in signal amplification processes with various potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the High&#8208;valence Oxygen Degradation Across the Delithiated Cathode Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge compensation on anionic redox reaction (ARR) has been promising to realize extra capacity beyond transition metal redox in battery cathodes. The practical development of ARR capacity has been hindered by high&#8208;valence oxygen instability, particularly at cathode surfaces. However, the direct probe of surface oxygen behavior has been challenging. Here, the electronic states of surface oxygen are investigated by combining mapping of resonant Auger electronic spectroscopy (mRAS) and ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) on a model LiCoO2 cathode. The mRAS verified that no high&#8208;valence oxygen can sustain at cathode surfaces, while APXPS proves that cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer evolves and oxidizes upon oxygen gas contact. This work provides valuable insights into the high&#8208;valence oxygen degradation mode across the interface. Oxygen stabilization from surface architecture is proven a prerequisite to the practical development of ARR active cathodes.</dc:description>

A type&#8197;II photoresponsive porous ionic liquid (PPIL) with permanent cavities is formed by dissolving Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP) in bulky ionic liquid .The MOP carries azobenzene moieties as pendant groups which undergo trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;isomerization under visible and UV light irradiation and thus, a controlled CO2 uptake and release is realized.







Abstract
A porous liquid is a unique liquid medium that combines the cavity of porous solids with the fluidity of liquids. This special characteristic offers potential in various applications. Here we report a type&#8197;II photoresponsive porous ionic liquid (PPIL) from dissolving a photoresponsive metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (PMOP, constructed from dicopper and azobenzene&#8208;containing carboxylate) in a polyethylene&#8208;glycol&#8208;functionalized bulky ionic liquid (IL). Owing to favorable ion interactions, bulky IL molecules encircle outside PMOP, and the inter cavities are maintained. The azobenzene moieties can be isomerized freely in the PPILs to expose and shelter active sites upon visible and UV light irradiation. Hence, the adsorption capacity of PPILs is controllable by light irradiation, and the change in CO2 uptake is up to 30&#8201;% compared to neat IL. This study may inspire the development of new adsorption process regulated by light instead of pressure and temperature swing adsorption.

         <title>Nanoporous Single&#8208;Crystalline Oxide Catalysts for Preferential Oxidation of CO in H2 with an Ultra&#8208;wide Temperature Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we fabricate porous single&#8208;crystalline oxide monoliths with deposited Pt clusters to create interfacial system for efficient and durable preferential oxidation of CO in H2 with ultra&#8208;wide temperature window.







Abstract
Preferential oxidation of CO in H2 (PROX) reaction is a promising solution to the on&#8208;board purification of CO&#8208;contaminated H2 fuel for use in next&#8208;generation proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). However, achieving high CO selectivity, activity and structural stability across the wide temperature window remains a great challenge. Herein, we fabricate centimeter scale interfacial PROX catalysts grown from nanoporous single&#8208;crystalline Pr2O3 and Nd2O3 monoliths with lattice surface&#8208;deposited Pt clusters at nanoscale. We demonstrate complete and selective removal of CO in H2 over an unprecedented wide temperature window (253&#8211;403&#8197;K). The monoliths are integrated with an operational PEMFC to purify the H2 fuel contaminated with CO (30&#8197;ppm) and enable stable power output for &gt;400&#8197;h; over two thousand times longer than without. This work demonstrates that the nanoporous single&#8208;crystalline oxide monoliths can simultaneously achieve the stability and overall performance required to realize practically useful PEMFCs.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Controlled Substrate Engineering Strategy for Site&#8208;Specific Enzymatic Fucosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A galactose oxidase&#8208;mediated redox system was coupled with enzymatic modular assembly strategy to control the site&#8208;selectivity of &#945;1,3&#8208;fucosylation. This redox&#8208;controlled site&#8208;specific fucosylation strategy provides a general and operational simple approach for the precisely enzymatic synthesis of various complex fucosylated oligo&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (oligo&#8208;LacNAc) containing O&#8208; and N&#8208;glycans with defined fucosylation patterns.







Abstract
Fucosylation is one of the most common modifications of oligo&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (oligo&#8208;LacNAc) glycans. However, none of known fucosyltransferases (FucTs) could install the &#945;1,3&#8208;linked fucose to the oligo&#8208;LacNAc substrates in a site&#8208;specific manner. Here, we report a facile and general redox&#8208;controlled substrate engineering strategy for the site&#8208;specific &#945;1,3&#8208;fucosylation of complex glycans containing multiple LacNAc units. This strategy takes advantage of an operationally simple oxidation enzyme module by using galactose oxidase (GOase) to convert the LacNAc unit into oxidized C6&#8242;&#8208;aldehyde LacNAc sequence, which is not a good substrate for recombinant &#945;1,3&#8208;FucT from Helicobacter pylori strain 26695 (Hp&#945;1,3FucT), enabling the site&#8208;specific &#945;1,3&#8208;fucosylation at intact LacNAc sites. The general applicability and robustness of this strategy were demonstrated by the synthesis of a variety of structurally well&#8208;defined fucosides of linear and branched O&#8208; and N&#8208;linked glycans.

         <title>Light, Heat and Electricity Integrated Energy Conversion System: Photothermal&#8208;Assisted Co&#8208;Electrolysis of CO2 and Methanol</title>

A kind of bifunctional viologen&#8208;containing covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework has been prepared and successfully applied in photothermal&#8208;assisted co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and methanol. The superior performance could be attributed to the cyclic diquats in Ni&#8208;2CBpy2+&#8208;COF that enhance the photothermal effect to accelerate faster charge&#8208;transfer between catalyst and immediate species as well as higher selectivity towards desired products.







Abstract
Strategy that can design powerful photothermal&#8208;catalysts to achieve photothermal&#8208;effect assisted coupling&#8208;catalysis is much desired for the improvement of energy conversion efficiency and redox product value in CO2 electroreduction system. Herein, a kind of bifunctional viologen&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (Ni&#8208;2CBpy2+&#8208;COF) has been prepared and successfully applied in photothermal&#8208;assisted co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and methanol. Specifically, the FECO (cathode) and FEHCOOH (anode) for Ni&#8208;2CBpy2+&#8208;COF can reach up to &#8776;100&#8201;% at 1.9&#8197;V with &#8776;31.5&#8201;% saved overall electricity&#8208;consumption when the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is replaced by methanol oxidation. The superior performance could be attributed to the cyclic diquats in Ni&#8208;2CBpy2+&#8208;COF that enhance the photothermal effect (&#916;T=49.1&#8201;&#176;C) to accelerate faster charge transfer between catalyst and immediate species as well as higher selectivity towards desired products as revealed by DFT calculations and characterizations.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Nanoradiosensitizers Enhance Radiotherapy by Combining ROS Generation and CO Gas Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional X&#8208;ray reactor, ZrRuMn&#8208;MONs@mem, was developed to enhance radiotherapy by combining ROS generation and CO gas release. The well&#8208;designed nanostructures can increase the direct absorption of radiation doses (primary radiation) and promote the deposition of photons and electrons (secondary radiation). Furthermore, the coating of the targeting cell membrane improved this radiosensitizer with a certain degree of targeting and biocompatibility.







Abstract
A lack of targeting accuracy and radiosensitivity severely limits clinical radiotherapy. In this study, we developed a radiosensitizer comprised of Ru&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic nanostructures (ZrRuMn&#8208;MONs@mem) to optimize irradiation by maximizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and CO release in X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced dynamic therapy (XDT). The well&#8208;designed nanostructures increase the direct absorption of radiation doses (primary radiation) and promote the deposition of photons and electrons (secondary radiation). The secondary electrons were trapped and transferred in the constrained MONs where they induce a cascade of reactions to increase the therapeutic efficiency. Meanwhile, the full&#8208;length antiglypican 3 (GPC3) antibody (hGC33) expressed a cell membrane coating enabling active targeting of tumor sites with optimized biocompatibility. The ZrRuMn&#8208;MONs@mem represents a starting point for advancing an all&#8208;around radiosensitizer that operates efficiently in clinical XDT.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient end&#8208;capping strategy is developed to construct intramolecular heterostructures by incorporating polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs). Thanks to the photoinduced spontaneous charge separation between COFs and PAHs, the heterostructured COFs exhibit outstanding activity and selectivity for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
It is well known that charge separation is crucial for efficient photocatalytic solar conversion. Although some covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit visible&#8208;light harvest, the large exciton binding energies reduce their photocatalytic efficiencies. Herein, we developed a novel method to post&#8208;treat the olefin&#8208;linked COFs with end&#8208;capping polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for spontaneous charge separation. Interestingly, a type&#8208;II heterostructure is constructed in our perylene&#8208;modified COFs which displays drastically enhanced performance for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, with an efficiency of 8&#8208;fold higher than that of unmodified COF. A combination of electrochemical, steady&#8208;state, and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic measurements indicates that such drastically enhanced performance should be attributed to photoinduced spontaneous charge separation in the heterostructure. These results illustrate the feasibility of engineering the charge&#8208;separation properties of crystalline porous frameworks at a molecular level for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Wide Band&#8208;Gap Polymer Donors Functionalized with Unconventional Carbamate Side Chains for Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique conformation lock is formed in a polymer donor using an unconventional carbamate side chain. It gives wide band&#8208;gap polymer donors for application in organic solar cells. Devices incorporating these donors yield power conversion efficiencies up to 18.76&#8201;%.







Abstract
Side&#8208;chain engineering with heteroatoms is not only effective in tuning frontier molecular orbitals, but also possible for forming secondary bonds which can be utilized to planarize the molecular backbone, hence, improving the photon absorption as well as charge&#8208;transport abilities of polymer solar&#8208;cell (PSC) materials. Herein, two types of unconventional side chains, namely carboxylate and carbamate, containing various heteroatoms are introduced to the thiophene bridges in high performance benzodithiophene (BDT) based donor polymers to from the novel polymers PTzTz&#8208;C and PTzTz&#8208;N, respectively. In these polymers, non&#8208;covalent O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S and N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions induce a high tendency to aggregation. In a ternary&#8208;blend PSC with PTzTz&#8208;N added to the high&#8208;performance D18&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9 blend, complimentary absorption and improved thin&#8208;film morphology were observed with a top power conversion efficiency of 18.76&#8201;%, which is an improvement of almost 5&#8201;% over the D18&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9 binary blends.

         <title>In Vivo Nitroreductase Imaging via Fluorescence and Chemical Shift Dependent 19F NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a bimodal probe to detect hypoxic tumors by both fluorescence and chemical shift dependent 19F NMR imaging under the catalysis of nitroreductase. Specifically, the concentration of nitroreductase can be detected in a broad range by fluorescence and 19F NMR, which is &#8804;1.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 and 10&#8211;50&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
Nitroreductase (NTR) is an important biomarker widely used to evaluate the degree of tumor hypoxia. Although a few optical methods have been reported for detecting nitroreductase at low concentration ranges, an effective strategy for nitroreductase monitoring in vivo without limits to the imaging depth is still lacking. Herein, a novel dual&#8208;mode NIR fluorescence and 19F MRI agent, FCy7&#8208;NO2, is proposed for imaging tumor hypoxia. We show that FCy7&#8208;NO2 serves as not only a rapid NIR fluorescence enhanced probe for monitoring and bioimaging of nitroreductase in tumors, but also a novel 19F MR chemical shift&#8208;sensitive contrast agent for selectively detecting nitroreductase catalyzed reduction. Notably, integrating two complementary imaging technologies into FCy7&#8208;NO2 enables sensitive detection of nitroreductase in a broad concentration range without tissue&#8208;depth limit. In general, this agent has a remarkable response to nitroreductase, which provides a promising method for understanding tumor evolution and its physiological role in the hypoxic microenvironment.

         <title>Unveiling the Protonation Kinetics&#8208;Dependent Selectivity in Nitrogen Electroreduction: Achieving 75.05&#8201;% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring the key intermediates&#8242; behaviors on the catalyst&#8216;s surface through modifying the electronic interplay among active sites can realize the adjusting of protonation kinetics. This work unravels the crucial factors of protonation kinetics to obtain superior alkaline nitrogen electroreduction selectivity and describes the protonation kinetics&#8208;independent selectivity relation, giving a deep understanding of the complicated and elusive nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) mechanisms.







Abstract
While higher selectivity of nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to ammonia (NH3) is always achieved in alkali, the selectivity dependence on nitrogen (N2) protonation and mechanisms therein are unrevealed. Herein, we profile how the NRR selectivity theoretically relies upon the first protonation that is collectively regulated by proton (H) abundance and adsorption&#8208;desorption, along with intermediate&#8208;*NNH formation. By incorporating electronic metal modulators (M=Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) in nitrogenase&#8208;imitated model&#8208;iron polysulfide (FeSx), a series of FeMSx catalysts with tailorable protonation kinetics are obtained. The key intermediates behaviors traced by in situ FT&#8208;IR and Raman spectroscopy and operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrate the strong protonation kinetics&#8208;dependent selectivity that mathematically follows a log&#8208;linear Bradley curve. Strikingly, FeCuSx exhibits a record&#8208;high selectivity of 75.05&#8201;% at &#8722;0.1&#8197;V (vs. RHE) for NH3 production in 0.1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte.

         <title>Competitive Non&#8208;Radical Nucleophilic Attack Pathways for NH3 Oxidation and H2O Oxidation on Hematite Photoanodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 is found to be a highly effective and stable catalyst for driving photoelectrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction via a novel non&#8208;radical nucleophilic attack mechanism under near&#8208;neutral pH. The selectivity of the ammonia oxidation reaction can be precisely tuned by manipulating the proportion of two surface species including Fe&#8722;O species and Fe&#8722;N species on &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3.







Abstract
The sluggish H2O oxidation kinetics on photoanodes severely obstructs the overall solar&#8208;to&#8208;energy efficiency of photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. Herein, we find a 10 to 55&#8208;fold increase of photocurrent by conducting ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) on hematite (&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3) photoanodes under near&#8208;neutral pH (9&#8211;11) and moderate applied potentials (1.0&#8211;1.4&#8197;VRHE) compared to H2O oxidation. By rate law analysis and operando spectroscopic studies, we confirm the non&#8208;radical nucleophilic attack of NH3 molecules on high&#8208;valent surface Fe&#8722;O species (e.g., FeIV=O) and Fe&#8722;N species that produces NOx&#8722; and N2, respectively, which overwhelms the nucleophilic attack of H2O on surface FeIV=O and contributes to a high Faradaic efficiency of above 80&#8201;% for AOR. This work reveals a novel non&#8208;radical nucleophilic attack strategy, which is significantly different from the conventional indirect radical&#8208;mediated AOR mechanism, for the rational design of high&#8208;performance AOR photoelectrocatalysts.

Herein, we find a 10 to 55-fold increase of photocurrent by conducting ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) on hematite (&#945;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) photoanodes under near-neutral pH (9&#8211;11) and moderate applied potentials (1.0&#8211;1.4&#8197;V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;) compared to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O oxidation. By rate law analysis and operando spectroscopic studies, we confirm the non-radical nucleophilic attack of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecules on high-valent surface Fe&#8722;O species (e.g., Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;=O) and Fe&#8722;N species that produces NO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, which overwhelms the nucleophilic attack of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O on surface Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;=O and contributes to a high Faradaic efficiency of above 80&#8201;% for AOR. This work reveals a novel non-radical nucleophilic attack strategy, which is significantly different from the conventional indirect radical-mediated AOR mechanism, for the rational design of high-performance AOR photoelectrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Programmed Separation of Hexane Isomers by a Porous Calcium Chloranilate Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel calcium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework shows temperature&#8208; and adsorbate&#8208;dependent adsorption of hexane isomers with different branching, leading to temperature&#8208;programmed separation of the isomers as a function of different degrees of branching.







Abstract
The full separation of alkane isomers as a function of different degrees of branching remains a daunting challenge due to its stringent requirement with respect to pore dimensions of the adsorbents. In this work, we report a novel microporous coordination network built on calcium (II) and chloranilate. The compound has a flexible framework and exhibits temperature&#8208;dependent adsorption behavior toward hexane isomers. At 30&#8201;&#176;C, it accommodates substantial amounts of linear and monobranched hexanes but fully excludes their dibranched isomer, and at elevated temperatures such as 150&#8201;&#176;C, it acts as a splitter for linear and branched alkanes. Its capability of efficient discrimination of hexane isomers as a function of branching is verified by experimental breakthrough measurements. Ab initio calculations have uncovered the underlying selective size&#8208;exclusion separation mechanism.

         <title>Host Spin&#8208;Crossover Thermodynamics Indicate Guest Fit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degree of fit between the binding partners within a host&#8211;guest complex is crucial for a highly selective interaction, yet difficult to separate from non&#8208;covalent interactions between the partners. The spin&#8208;crossover of a metallo&#8208;supramolecular host can be used to quantify guest fit, providing a new tool to describe host&#8211;guest binding that is complementary to binding constant determination.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) metal&#8208;organic cages capable of switching between high&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin states have the potential to be used as magnetic sensors and switches. Variation of the donor strength of heterocyclic aldehyde subcomponents in imine&#8208;based ligands can tune the ligand field for a FeII center, which results in both homoleptic and heteroleptic cages with diverse SCO behaviors. The tetrahedral SCO cage built from 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde is capable of encapsulating various guests, which stabilize different cage spin states depending on guest size. Conversely, the SCO tetrahedron exhibits different affinities for guests in different spin states, which is inferred to result from subtle structural differences of the cavity caused by the change in metal center spin state. Examination of SCO thermodynamics across a series of host&#8211;guest complexes enabled sensitive probing of guest fit to the host cavity, providing information complementary to binding&#8208;constant determination.

         <title>A Photoresponsive Battery Based on a Redox&#8208;Coupled Covalent&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Hybrid Photoelectrochemical Cathode</title>

A porous&#8208;shell/core hybrid (TN&#8208;COF@CNT) enables a long&#8208;range charge transfer relay and a high&#8208;rate dual&#8208;redox for the realization of efficient photo coupled ions transfer process. Equipped with such a photoelectrochemical cathode, a photoresponsive aqueous battery achieves reliable photoresponses, enhanced battery efficiency, stability and a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrochemical energy storage efficiency of 1.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photoresponsive batteries promise flexible and low&#8208;cost solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrochemical energy storage (SES), but suffer from a limited SES efficiency due to rapid charge recombination and sluggish redox. Here, we present a porous&#8208;shell/core hybrid of covalent organic framework@carbon nanotube. This hybrid ensures long&#8208;lived separated charges (&#964;ave=3.0&#8197;ns) by an electron transfer relay starting from the donor&#8208;acceptor molecules to the nanoscale heterojunction. These charges are further allowed to drive high&#8208;rate redox of &#8722;C=O/&#8722;C&#8722;O&#8722; and &#8722;C&#8722;N/&#8722;C=N+ with facile kinetics. Equipped with this photoelectrochemical cathode, a photoresponsive aqueous battery shows a 5&#8208;fold enhancement in SES efficiency (1.1&#8201;% at 1&#8197;sun) over their counterparts. It is unveiled that the electron relay favors the formation of electron&#8208;enriching &#8722;C&#8722;O&#8722; and hole&#8208;enriching &#8722;C=N+ groups responsible for photoelectrochemical Zn2+ and OTf&#8722; storage cascade; and further, the general photo coupled ions transfer (PCIT) process is proposed. This work presents an inspiring photoelectrochemical cathode design and theoretical insight for photoresponsive batteries.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough and Recyclable Ionogels Constructed by Coordinated Supramolecular Solvents</title>

         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;tough and recyclable ionogels are constructed by physical cross&#8208;linking of coordinated supramolecular solvents and linear polymer segments. The solvents in ionogels function as 3D supramolecular networks, which provide strong mechanical support for ionogels.







Abstract
The mechanical properties of most hydrogels (ionogels) are considerably affected by covalently cross&#8208;linked networks. However, the interactions between solvent/solvent molecules and solvent/polymer chains are usually ignored. Herein, a series of ultra&#8208;tough ionogels were prepared via a supramolecular solvent, halometallate ionic liquid, in which cations and coordinating anions form a 3D supramolecular network. The linear polymer chains are physically cross&#8208;linked with supramolecular solvents synergistically enhancing the strength (14.3&#8197;MPa), toughness (78&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), and Young's modulus (55&#8197;MPa) of ionogels, effectively dispersing the stress concentration under load, and obtaining better fatigue resistance and higher fracture energy (198&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2). Furthermore, the reversible cross&#8208;linking enables green recovery and recycling of ionogels, simply by water. This strategy shows broad applicability based on a variety of supramolecular solvents and coordinatable polymers.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of &#948;&#8208;Valerolactone and &#1013;&#8208;Caprolactone Caused by Uptake into Porous Pillar[5]arene Crystals</title>

Immersion of porous phenolic pillar[5]arene crystals in liquid lactones induced ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#948;&#8208;valerolactone and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone at room temperature. This is due to catalytic activity of the phenols via the hydrogen bonds and capture of linear polyesters by pillar[5]arene crystals. After the reaction, pillar[5]arene and polyesters formed pseudo&#8208;polyrotaxanes.







Abstract
Confined space provides a reaction platform with altered reaction rate and selectivity compared with a homogeneous solution. In this work, porous phenolic pillar[5]arene crystals were used as a reaction space to promote and perturb equilibrium between lactones and their corresponding polyesters. Immersion of porous pillar[5]arene crystals in liquid lactones induced ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#948;&#8208;valerolactone and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone at room temperature because the phenolic hydroxy groups have catalytic activity via hydrogen bonds and the pillar[5]arene cavities prefer linear guests. After the reaction, pillar[5]arene and polyesters formed pseudo&#8208;polyrotaxanes.

         <title>Rational Design of Carbon Nitride Photoelectrodes with High Activity Toward Organic Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;nitride&#8208;based photoelectrodes were produced by co&#8208;deposition of a blend of cyanamide&#8208;functionalized carbon nitride (NCNCNx) and indium tin oxide (ITO) nanoparticles on top of thin, alumina&#8208;coated conducting FTO&#8208;glass. The composite photoanodes display benchmark photocurrents with a range of different alcohol substrates, a low onset potential, and an incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) up to 60&#8201;% at 350&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Carbon nitride (CNx) is a light&#8208;absorber with excellent performance in photocatalytic suspension systems, but the activity of CNx photoelectrodes has remained low. Here, cyanamide&#8208;functionalized CNx (NCNCNx) was co&#8208;deposited with ITO nanoparticles on a 1.8&#8197;&#197; thick alumina&#8208;coated FTO electrode. Transient absorption spectroscopy and impedance measurements support that ITO acts as a conductive binder and improves electron extraction from the NCNCNx, whilst the alumina underlayer reduces recombination losses between the ITO and the FTO glass. The Al2O3|ITO&#8201;:&#8201;NCNCNx film displays a benchmark performance for CNx&#8208;based photoanodes with an onset of &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and 1.4&#177;0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V vs RHE during AM1.5G irradiation for the selective oxidation of 4&#8208;methylbenzyl alcohol. This assembly strategy will improve the exploration of CNx in fundamental and applied photoelectrochemical (PEC) studies.

         <title>Actinide Pnictinidene Chemistry: A Terminal Thorium Parent&#8208;Arsinidene Complex Stabilised by a Super&#8208;Bulky Triamidoamine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing a new super&#8208;bulky triamidoamine ligand to actinide chemistry has enabled the previously elusive terminal parent thorium&#8208;arsinidene linkage, that is the first terminal thorium&#8208;arsinidene, to be synthesised and isolated. Quantum chemical calculations reveal a surprisingly large change to the Th=AsH linkage compared to an electrostatically&#8208;bound potassium&#8208;capped analogue.







Abstract
We report the direct synthesis of the terminal pnictidenes [An(TrenTCHS)(PnH)][M(2,2,2&#8208;cryptand)] (TrenTCHS={N(CH2CH2NSiCy3)3}3&#8722;; An/Pn/M=Th/P/Na 5, Th/As/K 6, U/P/Na 7, U/As/K 8) and their conversion to the pnictides [An(TrenTCHS)(PnH2)] (An/Pn=Th/P 9, Th/As 10, U/P 11, U/As 12). Use of the super&#8208;bulky TrenTCHS ligand was essential to accessing complete families, and 6 is an unprecedented example of a terminal thorium&#8208;arsinidene complex and only the second structurally authenticated parent terminal arsinidene complex of any metal. Comparison of the terminal Th=AsH unit of 6 to the bridging ThAs(H)K linkage in structurally analogous [Th(TrenTIPS){&#956;&#8208;As(H)K(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)}] (TrenTIPS={N(CH2CH2NSiPri3)3}3&#8722;) reveals a stronger Th&#8722;As bond in the former compared to the latter, and a large response overall to the nature of the Th=AsH bonding upon removal of the electrostatically&#8208;bound K&#8208;ion; the &#963;&#8208;bond changes little but the &#960;&#8208;bond is significantly perturbed.

Zr&#8208;Carbide promoted Methane Dry Reforming on NixZry: Graphitic deposits anti&#8208;segregate into Ni0 nanoparticles to provide restored CH4 adsorption sites and near&#8208;surface/dissolved C atoms, which migrate toward the Ni0/ZrO2 interface and induce local ZrxCy formation.

Abstract
Graphitic deposits anti&#8208;segregate into Ni0 nanoparticles to provide restored CH4 adsorption sites and near&#8208;surface/dissolved C atoms, which migrate to the Ni0/ZrO2 interface and induce local ZrxCy formation. The resulting oxygen&#8208;deficient carbidic phase boundary sites assist in the kinetically enhanced CO2 activation toward CO(g). This interface carbide mechanism allows for enhanced spillover of carbon to the ZrO2 support, and represents an alternative catalyst regeneration pathway with respect to the reverse oxygen spillover on Ni&#8208;CeZrxOy catalysts. It is therefore rather likely on supports with limited oxygen storage/exchange kinetics but significant carbothermal reducibility.

         <title>A Sensitive and Nonoptical CRISPR Detection Mechanism by Sizing Double&#8208;Stranded &#955; DNA Reporter</title>

A DNA sizing&#8208;based biosensor utilizing the trans cleavage of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a against &#955; DNA is reported. The concept of target concentration dependent size reduction of &#955; DNA unlocks the possibility of using a variety of double&#8208;stranded DNA as nonoptical CRISPR reporters for developing point&#8208;of&#8208;care and easy&#8208;to&#8208;read nucleic acid detection biosensors.







Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;based biosensors often rely on colorimetric, fluorescent, or electrochemical signaling mechanism, which involves expensive reporters and/or sophisticated equipment. Here, we demonstrated a simple, inexpensive, nonoptical, and sensitive CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;based sensing platform to detect ssDNA targets by sizing double&#8208;stranded &#955; DNA as novel report molecules. In this platform, the size reduction of &#955; DNA was quantified by gel electrophoresis analysis. We hypothesize that the massive trans&#8208;nuclease activity of Cas12a toward &#955; DNA is due to the presence of single&#8208;stranded looped structures along the &#955; DNA sequence. In addition, we observed a strong binding affinity between Cas12a and &#955; DNA, which further promotes the trans&#8208;cleavage activity and helps achieve sub&#8208;picomolar detection sensitivity, &#8776;100&#8197;times more sensitive than the fluorescent counterpart. The concept of utilizing the physical size change of &#955; DNA unlocks the possibility of using a variety of dsDNA as CRISPR reporters.

         <title>Electrifying Adipic Acid Production: Copper&#8208;Promoted Oxidation and C&#8722;C Cleavage of Cyclohexanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexanol into adipate was achieved by incorporating copper into a nickel hydroxide electrode. Cu2+ plays a key role in weakening the interaction between the surface&#8208;adsorbed O&#8208;centered radical and the NiOOH surface, thereby facilitating C&#8722;C cleavage.







Abstract
Adipic acid is a central platform molecule for the polymer industry. Production of adipic acid with electroreforming technology is more sustainable compared to the thermochemical synthesis route. We discovered that incorporation of Cu2+ into a Ni hydroxide lattice significantly improved the electrocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexanol into adipate with a high yield (84&#8201;%) and selectivity (87&#8201;%). This Cu promotion effect serves as a mechanistic probe that can be combined with product analysis, steady&#8208;state kinetics, and in situ spectroscopy. A two&#8208;electron oxidation into cyclohexanone first occurs, followed by consecutive hydroxylation and C&#8722;C cleavage before dione formation. The central role of Cu2+ is to weaken the interaction between the NiOOH and surface&#8208;adsorbed O&#8208;centered radical that facilitates subsequent C&#8722;C cleavage. This enables a highly efficient two&#8208;electrode system capable of electroreforming KA oil into adipate and pure H2.

         <title>Photocatalytic Dissolution of Precious Metals by TiO2 through Photogenerated Free Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on experimental and theoretical results, this work explores the mechanism of photocatalytic precious metal dissolution. It is clear that photogenerated radicals and ligand molecules are key to precious metal dissolution, and the process has potential significance for enhancing photocatalytic selective recovery of precious metals.







Abstract
Exploring the pathways for photocatalytic dissolution of precious metals (PMs) is crucial for optimizing recovery. In this work, we systematically investigated the selectivity and solvation effects observed for dissolution by focusing on photocatalysis, precious metals and solvents. By combining transient characterization, reaction kinetics, and density functional theory, we determined that the radicals generated in photocatalysis were the key active species in the entire reaction. The cyano functional group in the solvent was the driving factor for dissolution of gold, and the importance of chlorine radicals for dissolution of platinum group precious metals was further confirmed. In addition, the catalytic properties of different precious metals can promote different transformations of functional groups, leading to selective dissolution. The structures of photocatalytic precious metal leaches also precisely explains the special coordination forms of precious metals and functional group ligands.

         <title>Unusual Scaffold Rearrangement in Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons Driven by Concerted Action of Single Gold Atoms on a Gold Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;surface synthesis of a polyaromatic hydrocarbon molecule is described. Mechanistically, the synthesis involves an unusual C&#8722;C bond cleavage catalyzed by Au adatoms with a molecular scaffold rearrangement. This rearrangement in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular scaffold is possible because of the concerted action of two Au adatoms that catalyze the reaction on the gold surface.







Abstract
Chemical transformation of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules following different reaction strategies has always been the focus of organic synthesis. In this work, we report the synthesis of a PAH molecule, formation of which consists of an unusual C&#8722;C bond cleavage accompanied by a complex &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular scaffold rearrangement. We demonstrate that the complex chemical transformation is steered by concerted motion of individual Au0 gold atoms on a supporting Au(111) surface. This observation underpins the importance of single&#8208;atom catalysis mediated by adatoms in on&#8208;surface synthesis as well as catalytic activity of single Au0 atoms facilitating cleavage of covalent carbon bonds.

         <title>Programmed Iteration Controls the Assembly of the Nonanoic Acid Side Chain of the Antibiotic Mupirocin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mupirocin is a clinically important antibiotic in which the polyketide fragment, monic acid, is esterified to a 9&#8208;hydroxynonanoic acid (9HN) side chain, which is essential for biological activity. NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, chemical probes and in vitro assays were used to establish how 9HN is assembled through the action of multiple acyl carrier proteins, two ketosynthases and fatty acid &#946;&#8208;keto processing enzymes.







Abstract
Mupirocin is a clinically important antibiotic produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586 that is assembled by a complex trans&#8208;AT polyketide synthase. The polyketide fragment, monic acid, is esterified by a 9&#8208;hydroxynonanoic acid (9HN) side chain which is essential for biological activity. The ester side chain assembly is initialised from a 3&#8208;hydroxypropionate (3HP) starter unit attached to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) MacpD, but the fate of this species is unknown. Herein we report the application of NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, chemical probes and in vitro assays to establish the remaining steps of 9HN biosynthesis. These investigations reveal a complex interplay between a novel iterative or &#8220;stuttering&#8221; KS&#8208;AT didomain (MmpF), the multidomain module MmpB and multiple ACPs. This work has important implications for understanding the late&#8208;stage biosynthetic steps of mupirocin and will be important for future engineering of related trans&#8208;AT biosynthetic pathways (e.g. thiomarinol).

         <title>A Vitamin B2&#8208;Photocatalysed Approach to Methionine Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite their emerging role in medicinal and biological chemistry, synthetic methods to access non&#8208;natural methionine analogues remain underdeveloped. Using vitamin B2&#8208;photocatalysis, simple sulfides undergo radical &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization with unsaturated amino acid partners to deliver an array of new methionine derivatives. The approach also facilitates the chemoselective modification of peptide side&#8208;chains.







Abstract
Access to new non&#8208;canonical amino acid residues is crucial for medicinal chemistry and chemical biology. Analogues of the amino acid methionine have been far less explored&#8212;despite their use in biochemistry, pharmacology and peptide bioconjugation. This is largely due to limited synthetic access. Herein, we exploit a new disconnection to access non&#8208;natural methionines through the development of a photochemical method for the radical &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfides with alkenes, in water, using inexpensive and commercially&#8208;available riboflavin (vitamin B2) as a photocatalyst. Our photochemical conditions allow the two&#8208;step synthesis of novel methionine analogues&#8212;by radical addition to unsaturated amino acid derivatives&#8212;and the chemoselective modification of peptide side&#8208;chains to yield non&#8208;natural methionine residues within small peptides. The mechanism of the bio&#8208;inspired flavin photocatalysis has been probed by experimental, DFT and TDDFT studies.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Kinetic States of a [2]Rotaxane&#8208;Based Molecular Shuttle Controlled by Acid Concentrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [2]rotaxane&#8208;based molecular shuttle with an acid&#8208;responsive asymmetric macrocycle on a symmetric dumbbell axle has been synthesized. The shuttling kinetics can be controlled by the acid concentration and the kinetic intermediate can even be captured at a high concentration of acid. This was explained by invoking different protonation states of the rotaxane at different concentrations of acid.







Abstract
A [2]rotaxane&#8208;based molecular shuttle with an acid&#8208;responsive asymmetric macrocycle on a symmetric dumbbell axle is reported. Upon adding TFA, the macrocycle, namely the amine naphthotube, is protonated and translocates from the di(quaternary ammonium) station to the triazole stations because of electrostatic repulsion and weakened binding. The shuttling kinetics are slow due to the steric hindrance caused by the ethyl group on the quaternary ammonium center and can be followed by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, it was found that the shuttling kinetics depends on the concentration of TFA. A kinetic intermediate was detected and can even be captured in the presence of a high concentration of TFA. Extensive control experiments revealed that the shuttling kinetics and the capture of the kinetic intermediate are related to the different protonation states of the rotaxanes.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Deaminative Amino&#8208; and Alkoxycarbonylation of Aryl Trialkylammonium Salts Promoted by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed aminocarbonylation of aniline&#8208;derived trialkylammonium salts promoted by visible light via a challenging C(sp2)&#8722;N cleavage. The reaction is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization and is amenable to telescoped carbonylations directly from anilines. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations support a novel mechanism involving a key visible light&#8208;induced carbonyl photodissociation and SNAr&#8208;type oxidative addition.







Abstract
Catalytic carbonylations of aryl electrophiles via C(sp2)&#8722;N cleavage remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate an aminocarbonylation of aniline&#8208;derived trialkylammonium salts promoted by visible light with a simple cobalt catalyst. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization and is amenable to telescoped carbonylations directly from anilines. A range of alkylamines are successful partners, and alkoxycarbonylation is also demonstrated. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations support a novel mechanism for catalytic carbonylations of aryl electrophiles involving a key visible light&#8208;induced carbonyl photodissociation.

         <title>Facet&#8208;specific Active Surface Regulation of BixMOy (M=Mo, V, W) Nanosheets for Boosted Photocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports (010) specific surface&#8208;regulated Bi2MoO6 nanosheets. The modified surface exhibits boosted CO2 photoreduction because of increased activation/adsorption of CO2 molecules. A combination of advanced characterizations and theoretical simulation confirmed performance and mechanism.







Abstract
Photocatalytic performance can be optimized via introduction of reactive sites. However, it is practically difficult to engineer these on specific photocatalyst surfaces, because of limited understanding of atomic&#8208;level structure&#8208;activity. Here we report a facile sonication&#8208;assisted chemical reduction for specific facets regulation via oxygen deprivation on Bi&#8208;based photocatalysts. The modified Bi2MoO6 nanosheets exhibit 61.5 and 12.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CO and CH4 production respectively, &#8776;3 times greater than for pristine catalyst, together with excellent stability/reproducibility of &#8776;20&#8197;h. By combining advanced characterizations and simulation, we confirm the reaction mechanism on surface&#8208;regulated photocatalysts, namely, induced defects on highly&#8208;active surface accelerate charge separation/transfer and lower the energy barrier for surface CO2 adsorption/activation/reduction. Promisingly, this method appears generalizable to a wider range of materials.

         <title>A Facile Structural Isomerization&#8208;Induced 3D Spatial D&#8208;A Interlocked Network for Achieving NIR&#8208;II Phototheranostic Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) organic phototheranostic agents (OPTAs) were constructed based on a facile strategy of structural isomerization&#8208;induced 3D spatial donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) interlocked network packing. Outstanding NIR&#8208;II tiny capillary vasculature/tumor imaging ability and synergistic photothermal/photodynamic anti&#8208;cancer effect in vivo were achieved with 6MNVDPP NPs.







Abstract
The performances of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) organic phototheranostic agents (OPTAs) depend on both molecular structure and molecular packing when used as nanoparticles (NPs). Herein, we proposed a facile structural isomerization&#8208;induced 3D spatial donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) interlocked network for achieving NIR&#8208;II OPTAs. Two isomers, 4MNVDPP and 6MNVDPP were synthesized and formulated into NPs. 6MNVDPP, which has a larger electrostatic potential difference, exhibits a compact 3D spatial D&#8208;A interlocked network in the crystal form, while 4MNVDPP forms 2D D&#8208;D type J&#8208;aggregates. Thus, 6MNVDPP NPs show red&#8208;shifted NIR absorption and larger molar extinction coefficient than 4MNVDPP NPs. Thanks to the typical NIR&#8208;II emission, superior photothermal&#8208;stability, high photothermal conversion efficiency (89&#8201;%) and reactive oxygen species production capacity, 6MNVDPP NPs exhibit outstanding NIR&#8208;II tiny capillary vasculature/tumor imaging ability and synergistic photothermal/photodynamic anti&#8208;cancer effect in vivo.

         <title>Design of a Protein with Improved Thermal Stability by an Evolution&#8208;Based Generative Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein design bears great interest in both research and industry. Evolutionary&#8208;based methods have been promising in designing new sequences based on the concept that the evolutionary fitness of a sequence is closely related to folding stability. Here we present a computational pipeline that, thanks to a combination of sequence&#8208; and structure&#8208;based methods, can design new sequences translating in functional proteins with enhanced thermal stability.







Abstract
Efficient design of functional proteins with higher thermal stability remains challenging especially for highly diverse sequence variants. Considering the evolutionary pressure on protein folds, sequence design optimizing evolutionary fitness could help designing folds with higher stability. Using a generative evolution fitness model trained to capture variation patterns in natural sequences, we designed artificial sequences of a proteinaceous inhibitor of pectin methylesterase enzymes. These inhibitors have considerable industrial interest to avoid phase separation in fruit juice manufacturing or reduce methanol in distillates, averting chromatographic passages triggering unwanted aroma loss. Six out of seven designs with up to 30&#8201;% divergence to other inhibitor sequences are functional and two have improved thermal stability. This method can improve protein stability expanding functional protein sequence space, with traits valuable for industrial applications and scientific research.

         <title>Orthogonally Integrating Programmable Structural Color and Photo&#8208;Rewritable Fluorescence in Hydrazone Photoswitch&#8208;bonded Cholesteric Liquid Crystalline Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work realized construction of distinct visible and fluorescent patterns in a single freestanding photonic film by integrating water&#8208;swellable helical polymer matrix and fluorescence switchable molecular switch. The orthogonally dual responsiveness of the novel optical materials enabled fabrication of anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption devices with superior safety and capacity.







Abstract
Design and fabrication of advanced security label showing superior performance in data encryption has attracted tremendous scientific interests. Especially, multifunctional optical labels capable of storing distinct information in different modes are highly demanded. Here, a fluorescent cholesteric liquid crystalline network (CLCN) film with programmable visible patterns and photo&#8208;rewritable fluorescent patterns was designed and prepared. The visible patterns were fixed by helical network and the colors of visible patterns were tunable by changing relative humidity (RH). The fluorescent patterns originated from dynamic isomerization of fluorescent hydrazones, exhibiting highly thermal stability and switching&#8208;ability controlled by light. The orthogonal construction of visible and fluorescent pattern enabled the novel CLCN to encrypt distinct information in reflective mode and in emissive mode, indicating its potential in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryptions.

         <title>Ultrafast Dynamics and Catalytic Mechanism of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fatty acid photodecarboxylase converts a carboxylic acid into a hydrocarbon and a carbon dioxide molecule through decarboxylation. Two critical carbonyloxy and alkyl radical intermediates in the catalytic reactions were captured by deep UV detection, and their dynamics were determined with actual reaction timescales, revealing the molecular mechanism of the enzymatic reaction and mapping out the catalytic photocycle of this efficient photoenzyme.







Abstract
Fatty acid photodecarboxylase is a newly discovered flavin photoenzyme that converts a carboxylic acid into a hydrocarbon and a carbon dioxide molecule through decarboxylation. The enzymatic reactions are poorly understood. In this study, we carefully characterized its dynamic evolution with femtosecond spectroscopy. We observed initial electron transfer from the substrate to the flavin cofactor in 347&#8197;ps with a stretched dynamic behavior and subsequently captured the critical carbonyloxy radical. The dominant process following this step was decarboxylation in 5.8&#8197;ns to form an alkyl radical and a carbon dioxide molecule. We further identified the absorption bands of two carbonyloxy and alkyl radical intermediates. The overall enzymatic quantum efficiency determined by our obtained timescales is 0.81, consistent with the steady&#8208;state value. The results are essential to the elucidation of the enzyme mechanism and catalytic photocycle, providing a molecular basis for potential design of flavin&#8208;based artificial photoenzymes.

         <title>o&#8208;Quinodimethane Atropisomers: Enantioselective Synthesis and Stereospecific Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective synthesis of atropisomeric o&#8208;quinodimethanes and their viability for highly stereoselective transformations are described. o&#8208;Quinodimethane precursors were readily accessible by an intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of triyne substrates and the in situ generated o&#8208;quinodimethane atropisomers were converted in highly stereospecific Diels&#8211;Alder reactions at elevated temperature with up to 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 e.r.







Abstract
o&#8208;Quinodimethanes have remarkable utility as reactive intermediates in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, enabling significantly accelerated routes to complex polycyclic compounds. The discovery of different discrete precursors to thermally generate o&#8208;quinodimethanes thereby greatly augmented their availability and versatility. However, due to the required high temperatures and the immense reactivity of o&#8208;quinodimethanes, stereoselectivity to afford isomerically defined products still constitutes a critical challenge. Herein, we describe the accessibility of atropisomeric o&#8208;quinodimethanes, the enantioselective synthesis of their precursors, their remarkable configurational stability and the stereospecific transformation by the benzannulation of dienophiles. A catalyst&#8208;stereocontrolled [2+2+2] cycloaddition, the generation of o&#8208;quinodimethane atropisomers and ensuing stereospecific Diels&#8211;Alder reactions enabled enantioselectivities through these transient intermediates with of up to 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 e.r.

         <dc:description>
Resembling the stacked orientation of nucleobases in DNA, arrays of aromatic carboxylates provide multiple &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in directing the formation of giant {Mo126W30} polyoxometalate cages. The interior aromatic units can be postsynthetically replaced by a selection of functionalized aliphatic dicarboxylates, offering options to fine&#8208;tune the microenvironment within the cage cavity.







Abstract
Here we report the formation of giant {Mo126W30} polyoxometalate cages templated by &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar ligands. Their inorganic shells incorporate arrays of 18 stacked aromatic carboxylates, such as 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate or 5&#8208;nitroisophthalate, and the assembly is stabilized by multiple &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. NMR data confirmed that the cages are stable in solution and the inner aromatic templates can be postsynthetically replaced by selected aliphatic dicarboxylates, paving the way for endo&#8208;functionalization and exploration of the reactivities within the cage cavities.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Redistribution between Hydrosilanes and Silacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed silane cross&#8208;redistribution reaction was developed for the synthesis of bis&#8208;silanes. The reaction is driven by enthalpy but not entropy, and the reaction is atom economical, without formation of gaseous silane side product. The reaction has broad substrate scope. This combined computational and experimental study shows that the reaction proceeds through a Ni0&#8208;NiII&#8208;NiIV catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Silanes are important in chemistry and material science. The self&#8208;redistribution of HSiCl3 is an industrial process to prepare SiH4, which is widely used in electronics and automobile industries. However, selective silane cross&#8208;redistribution to prepare advanced silanes is challenging. We now report an enthalpy&#8208;driven silane cross&#8208;redistribution to access bis&#8208;silanes that contain two different types of Si&#8722;H bonds in the same molecule. Compared with entropy&#8208;driven reactions, the enthalpy&#8208;driven reaction shows high regioselectivity, broad substrate scope (62 examples) and high atom economy. Our combined experimental and computational study indicates that the reaction proceeds through a Ni0&#8208;NiII&#8208;NiIV catalytic cycle.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Hofmeister Anion Selectivity via a Mechanical Bond Effect in Neutral Halogen&#8208;Bonding [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral XB [2]rotaxanes containing remarkably potent XB axle components including a novel 4,6&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;iodotriazole motif are constructed via a discrete chloride anion template directed synthesis. Quantitative 1H NMR halide anion titration studies in competitive aqueous&#8208;organic solvent mixtures reveal the XB [2]rotaxanes display pronounced anti&#8208;Hofmeister halide anion recognition selectivity for chloride over iodide.







Abstract
Exceptionally strong halogen bonding (XB) donor&#8208;chloride interactions are exploited for the chloride anion template synthesis of neutral XB [2]rotaxane host systems which contain perfluoroaryl&#8208;functionalised axle components, including a remarkably potent novel 4,6&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;iodotriazole motif. Halide anion recognition properties in aqueous&#8208;organic media, determined via extensive 1H NMR halide anion titration experiments, reveal the rotaxane host systems exhibit dramatically enhanced affinities for hydrophilic Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;, but conversely diminished affinities for hydrophobic I&#8722;, relative to their non&#8208;interlocked axle counterparts. Crucially, this mechanical bond effect induces a binding selectivity which directly opposes Hofmeister bias. Free&#8208;energy analysis of this mechanical bond enhancement demonstrates anion recognition by neutral XB interlocked host systems as a rare and general strategy to engineer anti&#8208;Hofmeister bias anion selectivity in synthetic receptor design.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Proton Rectifier Using a Heterogeneous Membrane Composed of Coordination Polymer and Layered Double Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;solid&#8208;state proton rectifier was fabricated using a heterogeneous membrane composed of proton&#8208;conducting coordination polymer, Cu2(CuTCPP), and hydroxide ion&#8208;conducting layered double hydroxide, Mg&#8208;Al&#8208;LDH(NO3). The device demonstrated a proton rectification ratio greater than 200, which is the highest among the reported all&#8208;solid&#8208;state H+&#8722;OH&#8722; rectifiers.







Abstract
Rational control of unidirectional proton transport is highly challenging, primarily owing to the difficulty in introducing an asymmetric factor into proton conducting media. In this study, free&#8208;standing membranes of a proton&#8208;conducting two&#8208;dimensional porous coordination polymer, Cu2(CuTCPP) (H2TCPP: 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) and a hydroxide ion&#8208;conducting layered double hydroxide, Mg&#8208;Al&#8208;LDH(NO3), were combined to generate a pH gradient in the conducting media. The current&#8211;voltage measurements revealed that the heterogeneous membrane exhibits a significant unidirectional proton transport with a proton rectification ratio exceeding 200 under 90&#8201;% relative humidity in the initial voltage scan. This value is the highest among the reported all&#8208;solid&#8208;state proton rectifiers. The high designability of both components with well&#8208;defined structures, which is in contrast to the organic polymers used so far, provides a new avenue for developing and understanding the proton&#8208;rectifying behavior in the solid state.

         <title>Coordination Switch Drives Selective C&#8722;S Bond Formation by the Non&#8208;Heme Sulfoxide Synthases
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calculations suggest that a coordination switch of the sulfoxide intermediate is involved in the catalysis of ergothioneine synthase (EgtB). This coordination switch from S to O is driven by the S/&#960; nonbonding electrostatic interactions, which efficiently promotes the observed stereoselective C&#8722;S bond formation while bypassing cysteine dioxygenation.







Abstract
The non&#8208;heme iron ergothioneine synthase (EgtB) is a sulfoxide synthase that catalyzes oxidative C&#8722;S bond formation in the synthesis of ergothioneine, which plays roles against oxidative stress in cells. Despite extensive experimental and computational studies of the catalytic mechanisms of EgtB, the root causes for the selective C&#8722;S bond formation remain elusive. Using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, we show herein that a coordination switch of the sulfoxide intermediate is involved in the catalysis of the non&#8208;heme iron EgtB. This coordination switch from the S to the O atom is driven by the S/&#960; electrostatic interactions, which efficiently promotes the observed stereoselective C&#8722;S bond formation while bypassing cysteine dioxygenation. The present mechanism is in agreement with all available experimental data, including regioselectivity, stereoselectivity and KIE results. This match underscores the critical role of coordination switching in the catalysis of non&#8208;heme enzymes.

&lt;p&gt;The non-heme iron ergothioneine synthase (EgtB) is a sulfoxide synthase that catalyzes oxidative C&#8722;S bond formation in the synthesis of ergothioneine, which plays roles against oxidative stress in cells. Despite extensive experimental and computational studies of the catalytic mechanisms of EgtB, the root causes for the selective C&#8722;S bond formation remain elusive. Using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, we show herein that a coordination switch of the sulfoxide intermediate is involved in the catalysis of the non-heme iron EgtB. This coordination switch from the S to the O atom is driven by the S/&#960; electrostatic interactions, which efficiently promotes the observed stereoselective C&#8722;S bond formation while bypassing cysteine dioxygenation. The present mechanism is in agreement with all available experimental data, including regioselectivity, stereoselectivity and KIE results. This match underscores the critical role of coordination switching in the catalysis of non-heme enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioactive Ion&#8208;Based Switchable Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the highly efficient information transmission of biologically active compounds in nerve systems, a well&#8208;controllable capture/release of biologically active ions is achieved by a switchable supercapacitor.







Abstract
Switchable supercapacitors (SCs) enable a reversible electrically&#8208;driven uptake/release of bioactive ions by polarizing porous carbon electrodes. Herein we demonstrate the first example of a bioactive ion&#8208;based switchable supercapacitor. Based on choline chloride and porous carbons we unravel the mechanism of physisorption vs. electrosorption by nuclear magnetic resonance, Raman, and impedance spectroscopy. Weak physisorption facilitates electrically&#8208;driven electrolyte depletion enabling the controllable uptake/release of electrolyte ions. A new 4&#8208;terminal device is proposed, with a main capacitor and a detective capacitor for monitoring bioactive ion adsorption in situ. Ion&#8208;concentration control in printed choline&#8208;based switchable SCs realizes switching down to 8.3&#8201;% residual capacitance. The exploration of adsorption mechanisms in printable microdevices will open an avenue of manipulating bioactive ions for the application of drug delivery, neuromodulation, or neuromorphic devices.

         <title>(Salen)Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogen Atom Transfer for Epoxides Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic and asymmetric hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction is achieved through a sequential (salen)TiIII&#8208;initiated radical generation and (salen)TiIV&#8208;induced enantioselective HAT process. It enables an enantioconvergent approach from readily accessible racemic glycidic esters and amides to synthetically valuable enantioenriched formal formaldehyde aldol products with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) represents arguably one of the most straightforward access to the significant chiral tertiary carbon centers, however, remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, the first example of catalytic coordination&#8208;induced asymmetric HAT reaction has been developed relying on a sequential (salen)TiIII&#8208;initiated radical generation and (salen)TiIV&#8208;controlled enantioselective HAT process. The reaction transforms easily accessible glycidic esters, thioesters and amides to synthetically valuable formal formaldehyde aldol adducts in an enantioconvergent manner, along with broad scope and highly regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Cu Single Atom Nanozyme Based High&#8208;Efficiency Mild Photothermal Therapy through Cellular Metabolic Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu single atom nanozyme achieves mild photothermal cancer therapy by a two&#8208;pronged strategy, where the delivered clinical medicine licogliflozin closes a sodium&#8208;dependent glucose transporter valve for blocking the energy required for the synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs). Meanwhile, the nanozyme forms a reactive oxygen species storm to damage existing HSPs.







Abstract
Upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) drastically compromises the treatment effect of mild photothermal therapy (PTT). Herein, we designed a polyporous Cu single atom nanozyme (Cu SAzyme) loaded with licogliflozin (LIK066) for HSP&#8208;silencing induced mild PTT. On one hand, LIK066 inhibits glucose uptake by shutting sodium&#8208;dependent glucose transporter (SGLT) &#8220;valve&#8221;, effectively blocking the energy source for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation. Without sufficient energy, cancer cells cannot synthesize HSPs. On the other hand, Cu SAzyme presents extraordinary multienzyme activities to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) storm formation, which can damage the existing HSPs in cancer cells. Through a two&#8208;pronged strategy of SGLT inhibitor and ROS storm, LIK066&#8208;loaded Cu SAzyme shows high efficiency for comprehensive removal of HSPs to realize mild PTT.

         <title>Advancing Critical Chemical Processes for a Sustainable Future: Challenges for Industry and the Max Planck&#8211;Cardiff Centre on the Fundamentals of Heterogeneous Catalysis (FUNCAT)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Viewpoint Article presents some of the research activities and visions of the newly established Max Planck&#8211;Cardiff Centre on the Fundamentals of Heterogeneous Catalysis (FUNCAT). Heterogeneous catalysis faces a number of challenges before a sustainable future may be achieved. Key concerns of FUNCAT are industrially relevant processes, such as green hydrogen production, ammonia synthesis, hydrogenation of carbon dioxide, and acetylene chemistry.







Abstract
Catalysis is involved in around 85&#8201;% of manufacturing industry and contributes an estimated 25&#8201;% to the global domestic product, with the majority of the processes relying on heterogeneous catalysis. Despite the importance in different global segments, the fundamental understanding of heterogeneously catalysed processes lags substantially behind that achieved in other fields. The newly established Max Planck&#8211;Cardiff Centre on the Fundamentals of Heterogeneous Catalysis (FUNCAT) targets innovative concepts that could contribute to the scientific developments needed in the research field to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the chemical industries. This Viewpoint Article presents some of our research activities and visions on the current and future challenges of heterogeneous catalysis regarding green industry and the circular economy by focusing explicitly on critical processes. Namely, hydrogen production, ammonia synthesis, and carbon dioxide reduction, along with new aspects of acetylene chemistry.

Integrating two complementary imaging technologies into FCy7&#8208;NO2 enables sensitive detection of nitroreductase over a broad concentration range without tissue&#8208;depth limit.

Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy was used by Boris&#8197;J. Nachtsheim, Christian Merten et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202204624) to verify DFT&#8208;calculated chiral iodane structures. Based on a chiral triazole&#8208;substituted iodoarene catalyst, a yet undescribed cationic chiral iodane was elucidated as the most populated intermediate under oxidative conditions with a significant intermolecular N&#8211;I interaction.

         <title>Activatable Multimodal Probes for In Vivo Imaging and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activatable probes capable of generating switchable multimodal imaging signals upon interaction with a molecular target of interest have attracted much attention in the past few years. This Minireview summarizes the recent progress in the development of activatable multimodal probes for in vivo imaging and theranostics, with a focus on their design, signal activation mechanism and biological applications.







Abstract
Multimodal imaging, which harnesses two or more imaging modalities to produce complementary anatomical and molecular information of a living subject, has become as a powerful tool in both basic biomedical research and clinical diagnosis. The progresses in multimodal imaging are paralleled by the advances in multimodal probes, particularly activatable multimodal imaging probes that can generate concurrent switches in different imaging modality signals upon interaction with a molecular target. These probes are extremely promising for in vivo imaging. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progress in activatable multimodal probes for in vivo imaging and cancer theranostics, focusing on their design principle, signal activation mechanism and biomedical applications. The current challenges and perspectives for future developments of activatable multimodal probes are also briefly discussed. We hope that this Minireview will provide inspiration for the design of other activatable multimodal probes for improving in vivo imaging and theranostics.

         <title>Sustainable Wacker&#8208;Type Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wacker&#8208;type oxidations afford highly value&#8208;added carbonyl compounds starting from readily available olefins and using scarce and expensive palladium catalysts at high dioxygen pressures and elevated temperatures. The last few years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the development of procedures that operate under mild conditions, as discussed in this Minireview. These procedures are based on more abundant and affordable, first&#8208;row transition metals, including metal&#8208;free processes.







Abstract
The Wacker reaction is the oxidation of olefins to ketones and typically requires expensive and scarce palladium catalysts in the presence of an additional copper co&#8208;catalyst under harsh conditions (acidic media, high pressure of air/dioxygen, elevated temperatures). Such a transformation is relevant for industry, as shown by the synthesis of acetaldehyde from ethylene as well as for fine&#8208;chemicals, because of the versatility of a carbonyl group placed at specific positions. In this regard, many contributions have focused on controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of the olefin oxidation by means of well&#8208;defined palladium catalysts under different sets of reaction conditions. However, the development of Wacker&#8208;type processes that avoid the use of palladium catalysts has just emerged in the last few years, thereby paving the way for the generation of more sustainable procedures, including milder reaction conditions and green chemistry technologies. In this Minireview, we discuss the development of new catalytic processes that utilize more benign catalysts and sustainable reaction conditions.

This Minireview discusses the role of nucleic acids as biorecognition and/or reporter probes in electrochemical biosensors. It highlights specific examples of nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based electrochemical sensors that have been evaluated with clinical or clinically relevant samples for the management of infectious disease, cancer, or cardiovascular health.







Abstract
Nucleic acids are remarkable molecules. In addition to Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing, the different structural motifs of these molecules can bind non&#8208;nucleic acid targets or catalyze chemical reactions. Additionally, nucleic acids are easily modified with different molecules or functional groups. These properties make nucleic acids, particularly DNA, ideally suited for use in electrochemical biosensors, both as biorecognition elements and redox reporter probes. In this Minireview, we will review the historical evolution of nucleic acids as probes in electrochemical biosensors. We will then review the specific examples of nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based biosensors that have been evaluated for clinical use in the areas of infectious disease, cancer, or cardiovascular health.

         <title>Dynamic Bonds: Adaptable Timescales for Responsive Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For dynamic polymer materials to respond to their environment and be tailored towards an application, the timescale of bond exchange must be tuned. Both chemical structural modifications and external factors such as temperature, catalyst, and matrix can be used to fine&#8208;tune the timescales of exchange. This Review focuses on the tools available to modulate the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymeric materials.







Abstract
Dynamic bonds introduce unique properties such as self&#8208;healing, recyclability, shape memory, and malleability to polymers. Significant efforts have been made to synthesize a variety of dynamic linkers, creating a diverse library of materials. In addition to the development of new dynamic chemistries, fine&#8208;tuning of dynamic bonds has emerged as a technique to modulate dynamic properties. This Review highlights approaches for controlling the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymers. Particularly, eight dynamic bonds are considered, including urea/urethanes, boronic esters, Thiol&#8211;Michael exchange, Diels&#8211;Alder adducts, transesterification, imine bonds, coordination bonds, and hydrogen bonding. This Review emphasizes how structural modifications and external factors have been used as tools to tune the dynamic character of materials. Finally, this Review proposes strategies for tailoring the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymer materials through both kinetic effects and modulating bond thermodynamics.

         <title>What X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopy Can Tell Us About the Active State of Earth&#8208;Abundant Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction

Electrochemical methods and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy are powerful tools to understand electrocatalysis on an atomistic level, yet the combination of these methods still holds untapped potential.







Abstract
Implementation of chemical energy storage for a sustainable energy supply requires the rational improvement of electrocatalyst materials, for which their nature under reaction conditions needs to be revealed. For a better understanding of earth&#8208;abundant metal oxides as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the combination of electrochemical (EC) methods and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is very insightful, yet still holds untapped potential. Herein, we concisely introduce EC and XAS, providing the necessary framework to discuss changes that electrocatalytic materials undergo during preparation and storage, during immersion in an electrolyte, as well as during application of potentials, showing Mn oxides as examples. We conclude with a summary of how EC and XAS are currently combined to elucidate active states, as well as an outlook on opportunities to understand the mechanisms of electrocatalysis using combined operando EC&#8211;XAS experiments.

         <title>Overcoming Electrostatic Interaction via Strong Complexation for Highly Selective Reduction of CN&#8722; into N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic interaction could severely inhibit the selective conversion of ions. This work proposes a strategy to overcome electrostatic interaction via strong complexation, realizing the preferential hydrogenation of cyanide at the cathode, and then oxidizing the reduction products into nitrogen at the anode. The controlled mass transfer of ions provides more possibilities for their selective conversion in the electrocatalytic system.







Abstract
Limited by the electrostatic interaction, the oxidation reaction of cations at the anode and the reduction reaction of anions at the cathode in the electrocatalytic system nearly cannot be achieved. This study proposes a novel strategy to overcome electrostatic interaction via strong complexation, realizing the electrocatalytic reduction of cyanide (CN&#8722;) at the cathode and then converting the generated reduction products into nitrogen (N2) at the anode. Theoretical calculations and experimental results confirm that the polarization of the transition metal oxide cathodes under the electric field causes the strong chemisorption between CN&#8722; and cathode, inducing the preferential enrichment of CN&#8722; to the cathode. CN&#8722; is hydrogenated by atomic hydrogen at the cathode to methylamine/ammonia, which are further oxidized into N2 by free chlorine derived from the anode. This paper provides a new idea for realizing the unconventional and unrealizable reactions in the electrocatalytic system.

         <title>Unveiling the &#8220;Proton Lubricant&#8221; Chemistry in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;MoS2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MoS2/PEDOT hybrid featuring enlarged interlayers (from 0.62 to 1.29&#8197;nm), good hydrophilicity and high electronic conductivity was prepared, demonstrating highly reversible H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction behaviors in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The co&#8208;inserted protons induced by PEDOT effectively shield the electrostatic interactions between MoS2/PEDOT and Zn2+, providing a new concept of &#8220;proton lubricant&#8221; to facilitate the Zn2+ diffusion.







Abstract
Proton insertion chemistry in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is becoming a research hotspot owing to its fast kinetics and additional capacities. However, H+ storage mechanism has not been deciphered in the popular MoS2&#8208;based AZIBs. Herein, we innovatively prepared a MoS2/poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (MoS2/PEDOT) hybrid, where the intercalated PEDOT not only increases the interlayer spacing (from 0.62 to 1.29&#8197;nm) and electronic conductivity of MoS2, but also activates the proton insertion chemistry. Thus, highly efficient and reversible H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction behaviors are demonstrated for the first time in aqueous Zn&#8208;MoS2 batteries. More intriguingly, the co&#8208;inserted protons can act as lubricants to effectively shield the electrostatic interactions between MoS2/PEDOT host and divalent Zn2+, enabling the accelerated ion&#8208;diffusion kinetics and exceptional rate performance. This work proposes a new concept of &#8220;proton lubricant&#8221; driving Zn2+ transport and broadens the horizons of Zn&#8208;MoS2 batteries.

The metalloradical [Ni(C6H6)2]+, hitherto unknown in the condensed phase, was synthesized from [Ni(CO)4]+[WCA]&#8722; and benzene ([WCA]&#8722;=[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3). The [Ni(C6H6)2]+ cation exhibits an asymmetric slipped sandwich structure. Its magnetic properties were determined in solution and in the gas phase. Further oxidation with the Ag+/0.5&#8197;l2 system led to the salt [Ni(C6H6)2]2+([WCA]&#8722;)2.







Abstract
A stable salt of the metalloradical [Ni(C6H6)2]+ hitherto unknown in the condensed phase was synthesized from [Ni(CO)4]+[WCA]&#8722; and benzene ([WCA]&#8722;=[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3). Single crystal XRD reveals a remarkable asymmetrically &#951;3,&#951;6&#8208;slipped sandwich structure. The magnetic properties of the [Ni(C6H6)2]+ cation were determined in solution and in the gas phase. Oxidation with the synergistic Ag+/0.5&#8197;l2 system led to the salt [Ni(C6H6)2]2+([WCA]&#8722;)2. All products were fully characterized by means of IR, Raman, NMR/EPR, single crystal and powder XRD.

         <title>Apparent 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig Carbofluorination of Alkenes Enabled by Palladium&#8208;Based Dyotropic Rearrangement</title>

Reversing the intrinsic cyclization mode. Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;alkylallyloxy)phenyl boronic acid derivatives in the presence of Selectfluor 2 provides chromanes 3 with concurrent generation of a tertiary alkyl fluoride function. A 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbopalladation affords PdII intermediate A whose oxidation to PdIV followed by 1,2&#8208;aryl/PdIV dyotropic rearrangement and C&#8722;F bond&#8208;forming reductive elimination affords chromane 3.







Abstract
Alkene difunctionalization featuring an intramolecular carbometallation step has been developed into a powerful transformation in organic synthesis. The 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbometallation is in general highly favored over the alternative 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization. We report herein a formal 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig carbofluorination protocol by combining the conventional 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbopalladation with a chemoselective 1,2&#8208;aryl/Pd dyotropic rearrangement. Treatment of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;alkylallyloxy)phenyl boronic acid derivatives in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(dba)2, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and Selectfluor affords chromanes with concurrent generation of a tertiary alkyl fluoride function. A &#963;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;PdII species resulting from the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbopalladation process is isolated and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Its oxidation to PdIV complex triggers the chemoselective dyotropic rearrangement leading to the ring expansion product.

         <title>Photoinduced Promiscuity of Cyclohexanone Monooxygenase for the Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Fluoroketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoinduced reductive dehalogenation promiscuity of cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) with a novel mechanism of ET/PT distinct from the photoinduced promiscuity of natural reductases is reported. Various highly enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;fluoroketones were synthesized by photoinduced reductive dehalogenation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;halofluoroketones in a process catalyzed by the rationally designed CHMO mutants.







Abstract
The development of mild, efficient, and enantioselective methods for preparing chiral fluorinated compounds has been a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we report a promiscuous cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) for the photoinduced synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroketones via enantioselective reductive dehalogenation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;halofluoroketones. Wild&#8208;type CHMO from Acinetobacter sp. possesses this promiscuous ability innately; however, the yield and stereoselectivity are low. A structure&#8208;guided rational design of CHMO improved the yield and stereoselectivity remarkably. Mechanistic studies and molecular simulations demonstrated that this photoinduced CHMO catalyzes the reductive dehalogenation via a novel electron transfer (ET)/proton transfer (PT) mechanism, distinct from that of previously reported reductases with similar promiscuity. This methodology was expanded to various substrates, and desirable chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroketones were obtained in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and e.r. values (up to 99:1).

         <title>Synthesis of Subporphyrin Free Bases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subporphyrin free bases, with bowl&#8208;like bent structures and distinct 14&#960;&#8208;aromaticity, have been synthesized by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic studies have revealed that the excited&#8208;state behaviors of the subporphyrin free bases are comparable to those of the corresponding BIII subporphyrins.







Abstract
BIII subporphyrins are the legitimate ring&#8208;contracted porphyrins consisting of three pyrroles and three meso&#8208;carbons and their chemistry has been extensively developed since the first synthesis in 2006. However, subporphyrin free bases have never been synthesized, despite tremendous attempts to remove the BIII ion. Here we report that Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling between &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diborylated tripyrrane 1 and tetrabromide 5 gave subporphyrin free bases 6, 6&#8201;A, and free base dimer 7 in 6&#8201;%, 4&#8201;%, and 2&#8201;% yields as the first examples. Subporphyrin free bases exhibit curved bowl&#8208;like structures and distinct 14&#960;&#8208;aromaticity. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy revealed that the excited&#8208;state behaviors of the subporphyrin free bases are comparable with those of the corresponding BIII subporphyrins. Rotational relaxation processes in the excited states have been revealed, which enhance the electronic interactions with the meso&#8208;aryl substituents and between the two subporphyrins.

         <title>Evaluation of the Specific Activity of M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs and the Intrinsic Activity of Tetrapyrrolic FeN4 Sites for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein used the equivalence of an active site extraction to the poisoning of active sites to develop a new method for the determination of site density, utilization factor and TOF. The method is reminiscent of stripping techniques but since there are no probe molecules involved it can be applied to different classes of M&#8722;N&#8722;C directly at the relevant pH.







Abstract
M&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalysts are considered pivotal to replace expensive precious group metal&#8208;based materials in electrocatalytic conversions. However, their development is hampered by the limited availability of methods for the evaluation of the intrinsic activity of different active sites, like pyrrolic FeN4 sites within Fe&#8722;N&#8722;Cs. Currently, new synthetic procedures based on active&#8208;site imprinting followed by an ion exchange reaction, e.g. Zn&#8208;to&#8208;Fe, are producing single&#8208;site M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs with outstanding activity. Based on the same replacement principle, we employed a conservative iron extraction to partially remove the Fe ions from the N4 cavities in Fe&#8722;N&#8722;Cs. Having catalysts with the same morphological properties and Fe ligation that differ solely in Fe content allows for the facile determination of the decrease in density of active sites and their turn&#8208;over frequency. In this way, insight into the specific activity of M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs is obtained and for single&#8208;site catalysts the intrinsic activity of the site is accessible. This new approach surpasses limitations of methods that rely on probe molecules and, together with those techniques, offers a novel tool to unfold the complexity of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst and M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs in general.

         <title>Accelerated and Concerted Aza&#8208;Michael Addition and SuFEx Reaction in Microdroplets in Unitary and High&#8208;Throughput Formats</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accelerated, catalyst&#8208;free, coupled Aza&#8208;Michael addition and SuFEx reactions between amines and ethenesulfonyl fluoride under ambient conditions in microdroplets are analyzed by electrosonic spray mass spectrometry (ESSI&#8208;MS) while high&#8208;throughput desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI&#8208;MS) is used to follow reaction scope.







Abstract
The sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reaction is significant in drug discovery, materials science, and chemical biology. Conventionally, it involves installation of SO2F followed by fluoride exchange by a catalyst. We report catalyst&#8208;free Aza&#8208;Michael addition to install SO2F and then SuFEx reaction with amines, both occurring in concert, in microdroplets under ambient conditions. The microdroplet reaction is accelerated by a factor of &#8764;104 relative to the corresponding bulk reaction. We suggest that the superacidic microdroplet surface assists SuFEx reaction by protonating fluorine to create a good leaving group. The reaction scope was established by performing individual reactions in microdroplets of 18 amines in four solvents and confirmed using high&#8208;throughput desorption electrospray ionization experiments. The study demonstrates the value of microdroplet&#8208;assisted accelerated reactions in combination with high&#8208;throughput experimentation for characterization of reaction scope.

         <title>Intrinsic Phase Stability and Inherent Bandgap of Formamidinium Lead Triiodide Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The residual &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (GBL) solvent molecules inside the void of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 single crystals promote the phase transition kinetics (2). By adopting the 2&#8208;methoxyethanol (2&#8208;ME) as solvent, highly stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystals could be acquired due to slow solid to solid phase transition (1). &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 with crystal size above 100&#8197;&#956;m has an inherent 1.41&#8197;eV band gap.







Abstract
Understanding the intrinsic phase stability and inherent band gap of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskites is crucial to further improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we explored the &#945;&#8208; to &#948;&#8208;phase transition and band gap of FAPbI3 single crystals grown by an inverse temperature solubility method. We found that the residual &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone solvents in the inner empty space of the FAPbI3 single crystal accelerate the phase transition at kinetics. By adopting 2&#8208;methoxyethanol as the solvent, over 2000&#8197;h of stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystals could be acquired. This proves that although FAPbI3 is regarded as unstable at thermodynamics, it could own excellent kinetic stability without any doping or additives because of the slow solid to solid phase transition instead of the fast phase transition assisted by the solvents. Furthermore, we revealed that the bulk FAPbI3 single crystal with a size above 100&#8197;&#956;m can have an inherent band gap of 1.41&#8197;eV. Thus, our work provides key scientific guidance for high&#8208;performance FAPbI3&#8208;based PSCs.

         <title>The Function of Two Radical&#8208;SAM Enzymes, HcgA and HcgG, in the Biosynthesis of the [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Cofactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The FeGP cofactor is the prosthetic group of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase, which catalyzes reversible hydride transfer from H2 to an organic substrate. HcgA and HcgG are involved in the biosynthesis of the FeGP cofactor. In vitro biosynthesis experiments indicated the functions of these two radical S&#8208;adenosyl methionine enzymes. HcgA biosynthesizes the initial pyridinol precursor, and HcgG contributes to the formation of the CO and acyl ligands.







Abstract
In the biosynthesis of the iron&#8208;guanylylpyridinol (FeGP) cofactor, 6&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinol (1) is 3&#8208;methylated to form 2, then 4&#8208;guanylylated to form 3, and converted into the full cofactor. HcgA&#8208;G proteins catalyze the biosynthetic reactions. Herein, we report the function of two radical S&#8208;adenosyl methionine enzymes, HcgA and HcgG, as uncovered by in vitro complementation experiments and the use of purified enzymes. In vitro biosynthesis using the cell extract from the Methanococcus maripaludis &#916;hcgA strain was complemented with HcgA or precursors 1, 2 or 3. The results suggested that HcgA catalyzes the biosynthetic reaction that forms 1. We demonstrated the formation of 1 by HcgA using the 3&#8197;kDa cell extract filtrate as the substrate. Biosynthesis in the &#916;hcgG system was recovered by HcgG but not by 3, which indicated that HcgG catalyzes the reactions after the biosynthesis of 3. The data indicated that HcgG contributes to the formation of CO and completes biosynthesis of the FeGP cofactor.

         <title>Modified Intramolecular&#8208;Lock Strategy Enables Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for Non&#8208;Doped OLEDs</title>

A &#8220;medium ring&#8221;&#8208;lock strategy is presented for the construction of thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters with small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, high photoluminescence quantum yield and large horizontal orientation factor, which enables to assemble non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with high external quantum efficiency of 26.2&#8201;% and power efficiency of 76.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1.







Abstract
The development of intramolecular&#8208;lock strategy is an appealing task for designing efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules, but only limited examples have been reported so far. Herein we present a &#8220;medium ring&#8221;&#8208;lock strategy to develop TADF emitters for improving the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The installation of an electron&#8208;deficient heptagonal diimide lock onto a highly rotatable biphenyl&#8208;based emitter not only enhances electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of acceptor that decreases singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), but also endows the skeleton with modest rigidity and flexibility that increases photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in neat film. In particular, the integration of the diimide lock also leads to an increase in horizontal orientation factor (&#920;//) from 69&#8201;% to 83&#8201;%. Consequently, this modified intramolecular&#8208;lock strategy enables an efficient TADF emitter to assemble high&#8208;performance non&#8208;doped OLEDs with a high external quantum efficiency of 26.2&#8201;% and a power efficiency of 76.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1.

         <title>Catalytic Reversible (De)hydrogenation To Rotate a Chemically Fueled Molecular Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most chemically fueled molecular switches suffer from the problem of waste accumulation inhibiting the system. Herein, we present a 180&#176; rotating molecular switch based on reversible (de)hydrogenation avoiding waste accumulation. Catalyzed by an iridium complex, switching from a pressure of argon to a pressure of hydrogen triggers a reversible change in the system from alcohol to ketone, promoting the rotation around an alkyne axis.







Abstract
We report here the development of a rotating molecular switch based on metal&#8208;catalyzed reversible (de)&#8208;hydrogenation. Under an argon atmosphere, acceptorless dehydrogenation induces a switch from an alcohol to a ketone, while reversing to a hydrogen pressure switches back the system to the alcohol. Based on a tolane scaffold, such reversible (de)&#8208;hydrogenation enables 180&#176; rotation. The absence of waste accumulation in a switch relying on chemical stimuli is of great significance and could potentially be applied to the design of efficient complex molecular machines.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Amidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation has been developed. This protocol is characterized by its mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity, thus unlocking a complementary technique to conventional C(sp3)&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reactions for accessing amine architectures from simple building blocks.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective intermolecular amidation of saturated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is reported. This mild protocol exhibits a predictable reactivity pattern to incorporate amide functions at C(sp3)&#8722;H sites adjacent to nitrogen and oxygen atoms in either cyclic or acyclic frameworks, thus offering a complementary reactivity profile to existing oxidative&#8208;type processes or metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reactions operating via two&#8208;electron manifolds.

         <title>Helical Molecular Springs with Varying Spring Constants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minature versions of Hookean springs can be built from single&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers. The spring constants of these molecular springs vary with the helix diameter analogous to classical springs. These new molecular springs provide an alternative mechanism of expansion/contraction controlled by the intrinsic helical geometries of the ladder polymers, which do not unfold under tension unlike more common flexible polymers.







Abstract
We report a general synthetic route toward helical ladder polymers with varying spring constants, built with chirality&#8208;assisted synthesis (CAS). Under tension and compression, these shape&#8208;persistent structures do not unfold, but rather stretch and compress akin classical Hookean springs. Our synthesis is adaptable to helices with different pitch and diameter, which allowed us to investigate how molecular flexibility in solution depends on the exact geometry of the ladder polymers. Specifically, we showed with molecular dynamic simulations and by measuring the longitudinal 1H NMR relaxation times (T1) for our polymers at different Larmor frequencies, that increasing the helix diameter leads to increased flexibility. Our results present initial design rules for tuning the mechanical properties of intrinsically helical ladder polymers in solution, which will help inspire a new class of robust, spring&#8208;like molecular materials with varying mechanical properties.

         <title>Unexpected Formation and Potent Antioxidant Activity of Macrocyclic Dimers Containing Disulfide and Selenide Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation and hydrolysis of selenides containing alkyl or benzylic bis(thioacetoxy) groups resulted in the unexpected formation of macrocyclic dimers, each containing two selenide and two disulfide bonds. These compounds exhibited potent catalytic antioxidant activity. Kinetic experiments indicated an autocatalytic mechanism involving the corresponding selenoxide and hydroxy perhydroxy selenurane intermediates.







Abstract
During attempts to prepare spirodithiaselenuranes as GPx mimetics, a series of unexpected dimeric macrocycles was obtained, each containing two selenide and two disulfide moieties in rings ranging from 18&#8208; to 26&#8208;membered. The products showed potent GPx&#8208;like activity in an NMR assay based on their ability to catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with benzyl thiol. The high catalytic activity was attributed to transannular effects during selenide to selenoxide oxidation. This redox process was also characterized by an induction period that indicated autocatalysis in the formation of an intermediate selenoxide from the oxidation of the corresponding selenide.

We unravel the unique electrolyte chemistry in Ca metal anodes to tailor the solid electrolyte interphase characteristics, leading to the design of several promising electrolyte formulations for reversible Ca deposition/stripping with a commercially available calcium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt. In particular, 1&#8208;methylimidazole (MeIm)&#8208; and dimethylacetamide (DMAc)&#8208; based electrolytes allow stable cycling with low overpotentials.







Abstract
The development of rechargeable Ca metal batteries (RCMBs) is hindered by the Ca2+ passivating solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). The cation solvation structure dictated by electrolyte chemistry plays a critical role in the SEIs properties. While a relatively weak cation&#8208;solvent binding is preferred in Li metal anodes to promote anion&#8208;derived SEIs, we demonstrate an enhanced Ca deposition/stripping reversibility under a strong cation&#8208;solvent interaction, which is materialized in strongly&#8208;solvating solvent and highly&#8208;dissociated salt combinations. Such electrolyte formulations benefit the formation of solvent&#8208;occupied solvation structure and minimize the anion reduction, resulting in organic&#8208;rich/CaF2&#8208;poor SEIs for reversible Ca metal anodes. Furthermore, RCMBs paired with an organic cathode using the optimized electrolytes are demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. Our work reveals the paradigm shift in SEIs design for Ca metal anodes, opening up new opportunities for emerging RCMBs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tight Host&#8208;Guest Binding with Exceptionally Strong Positive Cooperativity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complexation of DABCO&#8208;based cationic guests with a rigid aromatic oligoamide macrocycle exhibits remarkably high binding affinities with positive cooperativity that is among the strongest for synthetic host&#8211;guest systems. The ultra&#8208;tight binding and extraordinary positive cooperativity are driven by size/shape host&#8211;guest matching, guest&#8208;activated stacking of macrocycles, and multiple charge&#8208;dipole and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions.







Abstract
Cooperativity plays a critical role in self&#8208;assembly and molecular recognition. A rigid aromatic oligoamide macrocycle with a cyclodirectional backbone binds with DABCO&#8208;based cationic guests in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio in high affinities (Ktotal &#8776;1013&#8197;M&#8722;2) in the highly polar DMF. The host&#8211;guest binding also exhibits exceptionally strong positive cooperativity quantified by interaction factors &#945; that are among the largest for synthetic host&#8211;guest systems. The unusually strong positive cooperativity, revealed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fully corroborated by mass spectrometry, NMR and computational studies, is driven by guest&#8208;induced stacking of the macrocycles and stabilization from the alkyl end chains of the guests, interactions that appear upon binding the second macrocycle. With its tight binding driven by extraordinary positive cooperativity, this host&#8211;guest system provides a tunable platform for studying molecular interactions and for constructing stable supramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Upgrading Kolbe Electrolysis&#8212;Highly Efficient Production of Green Fuels and Solvents by Coupling Biosynthesis and Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>

Linking Kolbe electrolysis that converts biobased acids with microbial fermentation of gaseous electrolysis products in a paired electrolyser creates a highly efficient production route for fuel additives and solvents.







Abstract
The chemical industry is transitioning to more sustainable and biobased processes. One key element of this transition is coupling energy fluxes and feedstock utilization for optimizing processes, routes and efficiencies. Here, we show for the first time the coupling of the Kolbe electrolysis at the anode with a subsequent microbial conversion of the cathodically produced co&#8208;product hydrogen. Kolbe electrolysis of valeric acid yields the liquid drop&#8208;in fuel additive n&#8208;octane. Subsequently, the solvent isopropanol is produced by resting Cupriavidus necator cells using gaseous electrolysis products (esp. CO2 and H2). The resting microbial cells show carbon efficiencies of up to 41&#8201;% and Coulombic/Faradaic efficiencies of 60&#8201;% and 80&#8201;% for anodic and cathodic reactions, respectively. The implementation of a paired electrolyser resulted in superior process performances with overall efficiencies of up to 64.4&#8201;%.

The control over the non&#8208;linear optical property of nanoclusters as single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence has been accomplished by exploiting the solvent effect.







Abstract
It remains challenging to control the single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence of metal nanoclusters. In this work, the control over the non&#8208;linear optics of metal nanoclusters as single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence has been accomplished via exploiting the solvent effect. An emissive nanocluster, Au9Ag6(SPhtOMe)4(DPPOE)3Cl3, was synthesized and structurally determined. The solvent effect can not only control the fluorescence of this nanocluster, but more significantly, it can also regulate the photoluminescence nature of the cluster as single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence. We concluded that the increased solution polarity, improved dipole moment, enlarged HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap, and reduced solution viscosity of the cluster in solutions endow them with excellent high&#8208;order multiphoton excited fluorescence. The results provide an intriguing cluster template that enables us to manipulate the linear and nonlinear optics at the atomic level.

         <title>Structure Elucidation of In Situ Generated Chiral Hypervalent Iodine Complexes via Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their instability and reactivity, the structure of in situ generated iodane(III) species is challenging to characterize. VCD spectroscopy reveals a cationic species as the most important intermediate of a chiral triazole&#8208;containing aryl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane catalyst under oxidative conditions.







Abstract
The structure of in situ generated chiral aryl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes obtained under oxidative reaction conditions was not yet observable with experimental techniques and their proposed structures are purely based on DFT calculations. Herein, we establish vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy as an experimental technique to verify DFT&#8208;calculated chiral iodane structures. Based on a chiral triazole&#8208;substituted iodoarene catalyst, we were able to elucidate a yet undescribed cationic chiral iodane as the most populated intermediate under oxidative conditions with a significant intramolecular N&#8722;I&#8208;interaction and no significant interactions with tosylate or m&#8208;chlorobenzoic acid as potential anionic ligands. Instead, aggregation of these substrates was found, which resulted in the formation of a non&#8208;coordinating anionic hydrogen bonded complex. The importance of VCD as a crucial experimental observable is further highlighted by the fact that our initial structural proposal, that was purely based on DFT calculations, could be falsified.

         <title>Boosting Charge Transport in a 2D/3D Perovskite Heterostructure by Selecting an Ordered 2D Perovskite as the Passivator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that an ordered 2D perovskite can significantly boost the photoelectric performance of 2D/3D perovskite&#160;heterostructures. Using selective fluorination of phenyl&#8208;ethyl ammonium (PEA) lead iodide to passivate 3D FA0.8Cs0.2PbI3, we find that the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures passivated by a higher ordered 2D perovskite have lower Urbach energy, yielding a remarkable increase in photoluminescence (PL) intensity, PL lifetime, charge&#8208;carrier mobilities (&#966;&#181;), and carrier diffusion length (LD) for a certain 2D perovskite content. High performance with an ultralong PL lifetime of ~1.3 &#181;s, high &#966;&#181; of ~18.56 cm2V&#8208;1s&#8208;1, and long LD of ~7.85 &#181;m is achieved in the 2D/3D films when passivated by 16.67% para&#8208;fluoro&#8208;PEA2PbI4. This carrier diffusion length is comparable to that of some perovskite single crystals (&gt;5 &#181;m). These findings provide key missing information on how the organic cations of 2D perovskites influence the performance of 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Shortwave infrared fluorofluorophores for multicolor in vivo imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing chemical tools to detect and influence biological processes is a cornerstone of chemical biology. Here we combine two tools which rely on orthogonality&#8211; perfluorocarbons and multiplexed shortwave infrared fluorescence imaging&#8211; to track the biodistribution of nanoemulsions in real time in living mice. Drawing inspiration from fluorous and shortwave infrared (SWIR) fluorophore development, we prepared two SWIR&#8208;emissive, fluorous&#8208;soluble chromenylium polymethine dyes. These are the most red&#8208;shifted fluorous fluorophores&#8211; &#8220;fluorofluorophores&#8221;&#8211; to date. After characterizing the dyes, their utility was demonstrated by tracking perfluorocarbon nanoemulsion biodistribution in vivo. Using an excitation&#8208;multiplexed approach to visualize two variables simultaneously, we gained insight into the importance of size and surfactant identity on biodistribution.</dc:description>

         <title>A disordered Rubik&#8217;s cube&#8208;inspired framework for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with ultralong cycle lifespan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) with fast&#8208;charge capability and long lifespan could be applied in various sustainable energy storage systems, from personal devices to grid storage. Multi&#8208;metallic hexacyanoferrate (HCF) nanoclusters offer tailorable and unique chemistries and crystal structures that hold great potential in a virtually unlimited compositional space, leading to unexpected properties and interesting novelty in a wide variety of applications such as cathode materials for SIBs. Inspired by the disordered Rubik&#8217;s cube, here, we report that the high&#8208;entropy (HE) concept can lead to a very substantial improvement in the sodium storage properties of HCF. An example of HE&#8208;HCF with the formula of Na1.41Mn0.32Fe0.11Co0.28Ni0.32Cu0.32[Fe(CN)6]&#215;2.89H2O has been synthesized as a proof of concept, which has achieved impressive cycling stability (~ 95% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles and 79.2% after 50,000 cycles) and an outstanding fast&#8208;charging capability up to 75 C. Remarkable air stability and all&#8208;climate performance are observed. Its quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;strain reaction mechanism and high sodium diffusion coefficient have been measured and analyzed by multiple in&#8208;situ techniques and density functional theory calculations. This strategy provides new insights into the development of advanced electrode materials and provides the opportunity to tune electrochemical performance by tailoring the atomic composition.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;entity Electrochemistry Unveils Dynamic Transformation during Tandem Catalysis of Cu2O and Co3O4 for Converting NO3&#8722; to NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemically converting nitrate to ammonia is an essential and sustainable approach to restoring the globally perturbed nitrogen cycle. The rational design of catalysts for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) based on a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism is of high significance. We report a Cu2O+Co3O4 tandem catalyst which enhances the NH3 production rate by ~2.7&#8208;fold com&#173;pared to Co3O4 and ~7.5&#8208;fold compared with Cu2O, respectively.

         <title>Caught in Action: Visualizing Dynamic Nanostructures Within Supramolecular Systems Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular systems chemistry has been an area of active research to develop nanomaterials with life&#8208;like functions. Progress in systems chemistry relies on our ability to probe the nanostructure formation in solution. Often visualizing the dynamics of nanostructures which transform over time is a formidable challenge. This necessitates a paradigm shift from dry sample imaging towards solution&#8208;based techniques. &#160;We review the application of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques for real&#8208;time,&#160;  in situ  &#160;visualization of dynamic self&#8208;assembly processes. We present how solution&#8208;based techniques namely optical super&#8208;resolution microscopy, solution&#8208;state atomic force microscopy, liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy, molecular dynamics simulations and other emerging techniques are revolutionizing our understanding of active and adaptive nanomaterials with life&#8208;like functions. This review provides the visualization toolbox and futuristic vision to tap the potential of dynamic nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Li&#8208;ion Storage and Dynamics in TiO2 Nanoparticle Clusters Probed by Smart Scanning Electrochemical Cell Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anatase TiO2 is a promising material for Li&#8208;ion (Li+) batteries with fast charging capability. However, Li+ (de)intercalation dynamics in TiO2 remain elusive and reported diffusivities span many orders of magnitude. Here, we develop a smart protocol for scanning electroche&#173;mical cell microscopy (SECCM) with in situ optical microscopy (OM) to enable the high&#8208;throughput charge/discharge analysis of single TiO2 nanoparticle clusters. Directly probing active nanoparticles revealed that TiO2 with a size of ~50 nm can store over 30% of the theoretical capacity at an extremely fast charge/discharge rate of ~100 C. This finding of fast Li+ storage in TiO2 particles strengthens its potential for fast&#8208;charging batteries. More generally, smart SECCM&#8208;OM should find wide applications for high&#8208;throughput electrochemical screening of nanostructured materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Benchmark Dynamics of Dipolar Molecular Rotors in Fluorinated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs), comprising a wheel&#8208;shaped ligand with geminal rotating fluorine atoms, produced benchmark mobility of correlated dipolar rotors at 2 K, with practically null activation energy (Ea = 17 cal/mol). 1H T1 NMR revealed multiple relaxation phenomena due to the exchange among correlated dipole&#8208;rotor configurations. Synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction at 4 K, Density Functional Theory, Molecular Dynamics and phonon calculations showed the fluid landscape and pointed out a cascade mechanism converting dipole configurations into each other. &#160;Gas accessibility, shown by hyperpolarized&#8208;Xe NMR, allowed for chemical stimuli intervention: CO2 triggered dipole reorientation, reducing their collective dynamics and stimulating a dipole configuration change in the crystal. Dynamic materials under limited thermal noise and high responsiveness enable the fabrication of molecular machines with low energy dissipation and controllable dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron Nanoparticles Protected by Chainmail&#8208;structured Graphene for Durable Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Nitrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is an appealing technology for regulating the nitrogen cycle. Metallic iron is one of the well&#8208;known electrocatalysts for NO3RR, but it suffers from poor durability due to leaching and oxidation of iron during the electrocatalytic process. In this work, a graphene&#8208;nanochainmail&#8208;protected iron nanoparticle (Fe@Gnc) electrocatalyst is reported. It displays superior nitrate removal efficiency and high nitrogen selectivity. Notably, the catalyst delivers exceptional stability and durability, with the nitrate removal rate and nitrogen selectivity remained ~96% of that of the first time after up to 40 cycles (24 h for one cycle). As expected, the conductive graphene nanochainmail provides robust protection for the internal iron active sites, allowing Fe@Gnc to maintain its long&#8208;lasting electrochemical nitrate catalytic activity. This research proposes a workable solution for the scientific challenge of poor lasting ability of iron&#8208;based electrocatalysts in large&#8208;scale industrialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Durable Electrocatalytic Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia over Defective Pseudobrookite Fe2TiO5 Nanofibers with Abundant&#160;Oxygen Vacancies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We propose the pseudobrookite Fe2TiO5 nanofiber with abundant oxygen vacancies as a new electrocatalyst to ambiently reduce nitrate to ammonia. Such catalyst achieves a large NH3 yield of 0.73 mmol h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1cat. and a high Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of 87.6% in phosphate buffer saline solution with 0.1M NaNO3, which is lifted to 1.36 mmol h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1cat. and 96.06% at &#8208;0.9 V vs. RHE for nitrite conversion to ammonia in 0.1M NaNO2. It also shows excellent electrochemical durability and structural stability. Theoretical calculation reveals the enhanced conductivity of this catalyst and an extremely low free energy of &#8208;0.28 eV for nitrate adsorption at the presence of vacant oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks as electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal complexes are well&#8208;known homogeneous electrocatalysts. In this regard, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) can be considered as an ensemble of transition metal complexes ordered in a periodic arrangement. In addition, MOFs have several additional positive structural features that makes them suitable for electrocatalysis, including large surface area, high porosity, and high content of accessible transition metal with exchangeable coordination positions. The present review describes the current state in the use of MOFs as electrocatalysts, both as host of electroactive guests and their direct electrocatalytic activity, particularly in the case of bimetallic MOFs. The field of MOF&#8208;derived materials is purposely not covered, focusing on the direct use of MOFs or its composites as electrocatalysts. Special attention has been paid to present strategies to overcome their poor electrical conductivity and limited stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu/SaBox&#8208;Catalyzed Photoinduced Coupling of Acylsilanes with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction with Fischer metal carbene intermediates bearing an electron&#8208;rich alkoxyl or siloxyl group remains a big challenge due to the lack of readily available corresponding carbene precursors.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction with Fischer metal carbene intermediates bearing an electron-rich alkoxyl or siloxyl group remains a big challenge due to the lack of readily available corresponding carbene precursors. Herein, we report the coupling of alkynes with the Fischer-type copper carbene species bearing a &#945;-siloxyl group, which could be in-situ generated from acylsilanes catalytically under photoirradiation and redox-neutral conditions. The side-arm modified bisoxazoline (SaBox) ligands prove to be crucial for this coupling reaction, which provides the corresponding alkynyl alcohol in high yields with remarkable heterocycle tolerance and broad substrate scope.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Kinetics Support a Second Coordination Sphere Mechanism in Metal&#8208;Based Formate Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;based formate dehydrogenases are molybdenum or tungsten&#8208;dependent enzymes that catalyze the interconversion between formate and CO  2  . According to the current consensus, the metal ion of the catalytic center in its active form is coordinated by 6 S (or 5 S and 1 Se) atoms, leaving no free coordination site to which formate could bind to the metal. Some authors have proposed that one of the active site ligands decoordinates during turnover to allow formate binding. Another proposal is that the oxidation of formate takes place in the second coordination sphere of the metal. Here, we have used electrochemical steady&#8208;state kinetics to elucidate the order of the steps in the catalytic cycle of two formate dehydrogenases. Our results strongly support the &#8220;second coordination sphere&#8221; hypothesis.</dc:description>

         <title>MOFs with Open Metal(III) Sites for the Environmental Capture of Polar Volatile Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOF) with open metal sites (OMS) interact strongly with a range of polar gases/vapors. However, under ambient conditions, their selective adsorption is generally impaired due to a high OMS affinity to water. This led previously to the privilege selection of hydrophobic MOFs for the selective capture/detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Herein, we show that this paradigm is challenged by metal(III) polycarboxylates MOFs, bearing a high concentration of OMS, as MIL&#8208;100(Fe), enabling the selective capture of polar VOCs even in the presence of water. With experimental and computational tools, including single&#8208;component gravimetric and dynamic mixture adsorption measurements, in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory calculations we reveal that this adsorption mechanism involves a direct coordination of the VOC on the OMS, associated with an interaction energy that exceeds that of water. Hence, MOFs with OMS are demonstrated to be of interest for air purification purposes</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biocatalytic oxidation of acylated hydroxylamines enables the direct and selective introduction of nitrogen functionalities via activation of allylic C&#8208;H bonds. Utilizing either laccases or an oxidase/peroxidase couple for the formal dehydrogenation of N&#8208;hydroxycarbamates and hydroxamic acids with air as terminal oxidant, acylnitroso species are generated under particularly mild aqueous conditions. The reactive intermediates undergo C&#8208;N bond formation through an ene&#8208;type mechanism and provide high yields both in intramolecular and intermolecular enzymatic aminations. Investigations on different pathways of the two biocatalytic systems and labelling studies provide more insights into this unprecedented promiscuity of classical oxidoreductases as catalysts for nitroso&#8208;based transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Spin Polarization of a Narrow Linewidth Electron Spin Qubit in a Chromophore/Stable&#8208;Radical System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

Photoexcitation of tpPDI&#8208;BDPA&#8208;d16 results in ultrafast radical&#8208;enhanced intersystem crossing to produce&#160;a quartet state (Q) followed by formation of a spin&#8208;polarized doublet ground state (D0). Pulse&#8208;EPR experiments confirmed the spin multiplicity of Q and yielded coherence times of Tm = 2.1 &#177; 0.1 &#956;s and 2.8 &#177; 0.2 &#956;s for Q and D0, respectively. BDPA&#8208;d16 eliminates the dominant 1H hyperfine couplings, resulting in a single narrow line for both the Q and D0 states, which enhances the spectral resolution needed for good qubit addressability.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Synthesis and reactivity of transition metal compounds bearing &#8220;naked&#8221; pnictogen atoms is an active research area with remarkable bonding patterns observed in the formed compounds. Within this field, intense investigations on the coordination behavior of complexes possessing Pn and Asn (2 &#8804; n &#8804; 5) moieties have been conducted. However, studies on heavier analogues have been ignored so far due to arduous challenges related to low yields and moderate air stability. Herein, we present the first in&#8208;depth study addressing the reactivity of organometallic complexes containing Sb&#8208;donor atoms with several Ag(I) salts. These reactions afforded twelve unprecedented aggregates as monomers, dimers as well as three&#8208; and four&#8208;membered chains of Ag(I) ions claimed in the literature to be inaccessible. Interatomic distances as well as computational evidence obtained with help of several different methods suggest the presence of Ag&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag interactions in all complexes containing more than one Ag(I) ion.</dc:description>

         <title>An Organic Molecular Nanobarrel that Hosts and Solubilizes C60</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic cages have gained increasing attention in recent years as molecular hosts and porous materials. Among these, barrel&#8208;shaped cages or molecular nanobarrels are promising systems to encapsulate large hosts as they possess windows of the same size as their internal cavity. However, these systems have received little attention and remain practically unexplored despite their potential. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a new trigonal prismatic organic nanobarrel with two large triangular windows with a diameter of 12.7 &#197; optimal for the encapsulation of C60. Remarkably, this organic nanobarrel shows a high affinity for C60 in solvents in which C60 is virtually insoluble, providing stable solutions of C60.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanide Binding to [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Stabilizes the Alternative Configuration of the Proton Transfer Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogenases are H2 converting enzymes that harbor catalytic cofactors in which iron (Fe) ions are coordinated by biologically unusual carbon monoxide (CO) and cyanide (CN&#8211;) ligands. Extrinsic CO and CN&#8211;, however, inhibit hydrogenases. The mechanism by which CN&#8211; binds to [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases is not known. Here, we obtained crystal structures of the CN&#8211;&#8208;treated [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase CpI from Clostridium pasteurianum. The high resolution of 1.39 &#197; allowed us to distinguish intrinsic CN&#8211; and CO ligands and to show that extrinsic CN&#8211; binds to the open coordination site of the cofactor where CO is known to bind. In contrast to other inhibitors, CN&#8211; treated crystals show conformational changes of conserved residues within the proton transfer pathway which could allow a direct proton transfer between E279 and S319. This configuration has been proposed to be vital for efficient proton transfer, but has never been observed structurally.</dc:description>

         <title>Ceria&#8208;supported Cobalt Catalyst for LowTemperature Methanation at Low Partial Pressures of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct catalytic conversion of atmospheric CO2 to valuable chemicals is a promising solution to avert negative consequences of a rising CO2 concentration. However, heterogeneous catalysts efficient at low partial pressures of CO2 still need to be developed. Here, we explore Co/CeO2 as a catalyst for methanation of diluted CO2 streams. This material displays an excellent performance at reaction temperatures as low as 175 &#176;C and CO2 partial pressures as low as 0.4 mbar (the atmospheric CO2 concentration). To gain mechanistic understanding of this unusual activity, we employed in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and operando infrared spectroscopy. The higher surface concentration and reactivity of formates and carbonyls &#8212; key reaction intermediates &#8212; explain the superior activity of Co/CeO2 compared to a conventional Co/SiO2 catalyst. This work emphasizes the catalytic role of the cobalt&#8211;ceria interface and will aid in developing more efficient CO2 hydrogenation catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Tunability of Charge Transport in 2D Inorganic Molecular Crystals by Pressure Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique intermolecular van der Waals force in emerging two&#8208;dimensional inorganic molecular crystals (2DIMCs) endows them with highly tunable structures and properties upon applying external stimuli. Using high pressure to modulate the intermolecular bonding, here we reveal the highly tunable charge transport behavior in 2DIMCs for the first time, from an insulator to a semiconductor. As pressure increases, 2D &#945;&#8208;Sb2O3 molecular crystal undergoes three isostructural transitions, and the intermolecular bonding enhances gradually, which results in a considerably decreased bandgap by 25% and a greatly enhanced charge transport. Impressively, the in&#8208;situ resistivity measurement of the &#945;&#8208;Sb2O3 flake shows a sharp drop by 5 orders of magnitude in 0 &#8211; 3.2 GPa. This work sheds new light on the manipulation of charge transport in 2DIMCs and is of great significance for promoting the fundamental understanding and potential applications of 2DIMCs in advanced modern technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination of Polyketide Release and Multiple Detoxification Pathways for Tolerable Production of Fungal Mycotoxins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient biosynthesis of microbial bioactive natural products (NPs) is beneficial for the survival of producers, while self&#8208;protection is necessary to avoid self&#8208;harm resulting from over&#8208;accumulation of NPs. The underlying mechanisms for the effective but tolerable production of bioactive NPs is not well understood. Here in the biosynthesis of two fungal polyketide mycotoxins aurovertin E (1) and asteltoxin (4), we show that the cyclases in the gene clusters promote the release of the polyketide backbone, and reveal that a signal peptide is crucial for their subcellular localization and full activity. Meanwhile, the fungus adopts enzymatic acetylation as the major detoxification pathway of 1. If intermediates are over&#8208;produced, the non&#8208;enzymatic shunt pathways work as salvage pathways to avoid excessive accumulation of the toxic metabolites for self&#8208;protection. These findings provided new insights into the interplay of efficient backbone release and multiple detoxification strategies for the production of fungal bioactive NPs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is vitally important to develop highly active, robust and low&#8208;cost transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in neutral solution especially at large current density. In this work, amorphous Mo&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 nanosheets@crystalline NiS0.5Se0.5 nanorods (Am&#8208;Mo&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5) was synthesized using a facil one&#8208;step strategy. In phosphate buffer saline solution, the Am&#8208;Mo&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5 shows tiny overpotentials of 48 and 209 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 238 and 514 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 and 1,000 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Moreover, Am&#8208;Mo&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5delivers excellent stability for at least 300 h without obvious degradation. Theoretical calculations revealed that the Ni sites in the defect&#8208;rich amorphous structure of Am&#8208;Mo&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5 owns higher electron state density and strengthened the binding energy of H2O, which will optimize H adsorption/desorption energy barriers and reduce the adsorption energy of OER determining step.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A long&#8208;standing quest in materials science has been the development of tough epoxy resin nanocomposites used in numerous applications. Inspired by nacre, herein, we report tough and conductive MXene/epoxy layered bulk nanocomposites. The orientation of MXene lamellar scaffolds is enhanced by annealing treatment. The improved interfacial interactions between MXene lamellar scaffold and epoxy through surface chemical modification resulted in a synergistic effect. Tailoring the interlayer spacing of MXene nanosheets to a critical distance resulted in the fracture toughness about eight times higher than pure epoxy, surpassing other epoxy nanocomposites. Our nacre&#8208;inspired MXene/epoxy layered bulk nanocomposites also show high electrical conductivity that provides self&#8208;monitoring capability to the structure integrity and exhibits an excellent electromagnetic interference shielding efficiency. Our proposed strategy provides an avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance epoxy nanocomposites.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Glycosyltransferases are a notoriously difficult to inhibit superfamily of enzymes. Here we apply an mRNA display technology integrated with genetic code reprogramming, referred to as the RaPID (random non&#8208;standard peptides integrated discovery) system, to identify macrocyclic peptides with high binding affinities for O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT). These macrocycles inhibit OGT activity through an allosteric mechanism that is driven by their binding to the tetratricopeptide repeats of OGT. Saturation mutagenesis in a maturation screen using 39 amino acids, including 22 non&#8208;canonical residues, led to an improved unnatural macrocycle that is ~40 times more potent than the parent compound (Kiapp = 1.5 nM). Subsequent derivatization delivered a biotinylated derivative that enabled one&#8208;step affinity purification of OGT from complex samples. The high potency and novel mechanism of action of these OGT ligands should enable new approaches to elucidate the specificity and regulation of OGT.</dc:description>

         <title>PD&#8208;L1 Aptamer&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanoparticles for Robust Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy Against Cancer with Enhanced Safety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immune checkpoint blockade has become a paradigm&#8208;shifting treatment modality to combat cancer, while conventional administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody (&#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1), often shows unsatisfactory immune responses and lead to severe immune&#8208;related adverse effects (irAEs). Herein, we develop a PD&#8208;L1 aptamer (aptPD&#8208;L1) based spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), which consists of an oxaliplatin (OXA) encapsulated metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticle core and a dense shell of aptPD&#8208;L1 (denoted as M@O&#8208;A). Upon light irradiation, such nanosystem enables concurrent photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemotherapy and enhanced immunotherapy on one shot to inhibit both primary colorectal tumors and untreated distant tumors in mice. Notably, M@O&#8208;A shows scarcely any systemic immunotoxicity in a clinical irAEs&#8208;mimic transgenic mouse model. Collectively, this study presents a novel strategy for priming robust photo&#8208;immunotherapy against cancer with enhanced safety.</dc:description>

         <title>Cytochrome P450 Catalyzes Benzene Ring Formation in the Biosynthesis of Trialkyl&#8208;Substituted Aromatic Polyketides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lorneic acid and related natural products are featured by a trialkyl&#8208;substituted benzene rings. The formation of the aromatic core in the middle of polyketide chain is unusual. We characterized a cytochrome P450 enzyme that can catalyze the hallmark benzene ring formation from an acyclic polyene substrate through genetic and biochemical analysis. Using this P450 as a beacon for genome mining, we obtained 12 homologous type I PKS gene clusters, among which two gene clusters are activated and are able to produce trialkyl substituted aromatic polyketides. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to elucidate the plausible mechanism for P450&#8208;catalyzed benzene ring formation. Our work reveals a new strategy in nature to construct the benzene ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Water Uptake Enabled Ultrahigh Proton Conductivity of Graphdiyne Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton conductors have attracted great attention in various fields, especially in energy production. Here, we find that graphdiyne oxide (GDYO), derived from graphdiyne (GDY), features the highest proton conductivity of 0.54 S cm&#8722;1 (100% RH, 348 K) among the oxidized carbon allotropes reported so far. The sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;co&#8208;hybridized carbon skeleton of GDY enables GDYO with the giant water uptake, which is 2.4 times larger than that of graphene oxide (GO), resulting in ultrahigh proton conductivity by increasing the proton concentration and proton conduction pathways. This ultrahigh proton conductivity of GDYO is further proved in a methanol fuel cell by using GDYO membrane as proton exchange membrane. The GDYO membrane enables the cell with higher open circuit potential, larger power density and lower methanol permeability, compared with commercial Nafion 117. Moreover, the GDYO membrane bears high ion exchange capacity, good acidic stability and low swelling ratio.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries: Towards Harnessing their Full Power with Darwinian Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technologies are transforming the drug discovery process, enabling the identification of ligands at unprecedented speed and scale. DEL makes use of libraries that are orders of magnitude larger than traditional high throughput screens. While a DNA tag alludes to a genotype&#8208;phenotype connection that is exploitable for evolutionary cycles, most of the work in the field is performed with libraries where the tag serves as an amplifiable bar code but does not allow &#8216;translation&#8217; into the synthetic product it is linked to. In this review, we cover technologies that enable the &#8216;translation&#8217; of the genetic tag into synthetic molecules, both biochemically and chemically, and explore how it can be used to harness Darwinian evolutionary pressure.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The bottom&#8208;up preparation of two&#8208;dimensional material micro&#8208;nano structures at scale facilitates the realisation of integrated applications in optoelectronic devices. Fibrous Phosphorus (FP), an allotrope of black phosphorus (BP), is one of the most promising candidate materials in the field of optoelectronics with its unique crystal structure and properties.&#160;However, to date, there are no bottom&#8208;up micro&#8208;nano structure preparation methods for crystalline phosphorus allotropes.&#160;Herein, we present the bottom&#8208;up preparation of fibrous phosphorus micropillar (FP&#8208;MP) arrays via a low&#8208;pressure gas&#8208;phase transport (LP&#8208;CVT) method that controls the directional phase transition from amorphous red phosphorus (ARP) to FP. In addition, self&#8208;powered photodetectors (PD) of FP&#8208;MP arrays with pyro&#8208;phototronic effects achieved detection beyond the bandgap limit. Our results provide a new approach for bottom&#8208;up preparation of other crystalline allotropes of phosphorus.</dc:description>

A major strategy for dimerization is aryl coupling reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P450 or laccase. Actinorhodin (ACT) from Streptomyces coelicolor has a dimeric pyranonaphthoquinone structure connected by a C&#8208;C bond. Here, we identified a NmrA&#8208;family dimerizing enzyme, ActVA&#8208;ORF4, and a cofactor independent oxidase, ActVA&#8208;ORF3, both involved in the last step of ACT biosynthesis. ActVA&#8208;ORF4 is a unique &#160;NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the inter&#8208;molecular C&#8208;C bond formation using 8&#8208;hydroxydihydrokalafungin (DHK&#8208;OH) as the sole substrate. On the other hand, ActVA&#8208;ORF3 was found to be a quinone&#8208;forming enzyme that produces the coupling substrate, DHK&#8208;OH, and the final product, ACT. Consequently, the functional assignment of all essential enzymes in ACT biosynthesis was completed, which would be a landmark in our understanding of the entire biosynthetic pathway for one of the best&#8208;known model natural products, ACT.</dc:description>

         <title>An Engineered OmpG Nanopore with Displayed Peptide Motifs for Single&#8208;Molecule Multiplex Protein Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular detection via nanopore, achieved by monitoring changes in ionic current arising from analyte interaction with the sensor pore, is a promising technology for multiplex sensing development. Outer Membrane Protein G (OmpG), a monomeric porin possessing seven functionalizable loops, has been reported as an effective sensing platform for selective protein detection. Using flow&#8208;cytometry to screen unfavorable constructs, we identified two OmpG nanopores with unique peptide motifs displayed in either loop 3 or 6, which also exhibited distinct analyte signals in single&#8208;channel current recordings. We exploited these loops concurrently to facilitate single&#8208;molecule multiplex protein detection in a mixture. We additionally report a strategy to increase sensor sensitivity via avidity motif display. These sensing schemes may be expanded to more sophisticated designs utilizing additional loops for increasing multiplicity and sensitivity.</dc:description>
