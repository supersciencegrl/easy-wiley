      <title>Incorporating Transition Metal Phosphides into Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proven to be an excellent platform in photocatalysis. However, to suppress the  electron&#8208;hole  recombination, the Pt cocatalyst is usually inevitable, especially in photocatalytic H  2  production, which greatly limits the practical application. Herein, for the first time, the monodisperse, small&#8208;size and noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free transitional metal phosphides (TMPs, e.g., Ni  2  P, Ni  12  P  5  ), are incorporated into a representative MOF, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , for photocatalytic H  2  production. Compared with the parent MOF and their physical mixture, both TMPs@MOF  composites  display significantly improved H  2  production rates. Thermodynamic and kinetic studies reveal that TMPs, behaving similar ability to Pt, greatly accelerate the linker&#8208;to&#8208;cluster charge transfer and promote charge separation, as well as reduce the activation energy of H  2  production. Significantly, results indicate that Pt is thermodynamically favorable yet Ni  2  P is kinetically preferred for H  2  production, accounting for the higher activity of Ni  2  P@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  than Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2  .</dc:description>

      <title>Multispecific Platinum(IV) Complex Deters Breast Cancer via Interposing Inflammation and Immunosuppression as an Inhibitor of COX&#8208;2 and PD&#8208;L1</title>
      <dc:description>Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignancies in women and often accompanied by inflammatory processes. Cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) plays a vital role in the progression of BC, correlating with the expression of programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). Overexpression of PD&#8208;L1 contributes to the immune escape of cancer cells, and its blockade would stimulate anticancer immunity. Two multispecific platinum(IV) complexes DNP and NP were prepared using non&#8208;steroidal antiinflammatory drug naproxen (NPX) as axial ligand(s) to inhibit the BC cells. DNP exhibited high cytotoxicity and antiinflammatory properties superior over NP, cisplatin and NPX; moreover, it displayed potent antitumor activity and almost no general toxicity in mice bearing triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC). Mechanistic studies revealed that DNP could downregulate the expression of COX&#8208;2 and PD&#8208;L1  in vitro  and  vivo  , inhibit the secretion of prostaglandin, reduce the expression of BC&#8208;associated protein BRD4 and phosphorylation of extracellular signal&#8208;regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2), and block the oncogene c&#8208;Myc in BC cells. These findings demonstrate that DNP is capable of intervening in inflammatory, immune, and metastatic processes of BC, thus presenting a new mechanism of action for anticancer platinum(IV) complexes. The multispecificity offers a special superiority for DNP to treat TNBC by combining chemotherapy and immunotherapy in one molecule.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A nickel&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent hydroarylation and hydroalkenylation of unactivated alkenyl carboxylic acids is reported, whereby the ligand environment around the metal center dictates the regiochemical outcome. Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization products are obtained under mild ligand&#8208;free conditions, with up to 99% yield and &gt;20:1 selectivity. Alternatively, anti&#8208;Markovnikov products can be accessed with a novel 4,4&#8208;disubstituted Pyrox ligand in excellent yield and &gt;20:1 selectivity. Both electronic and steric effects on the ligand contribute to the high yield and selectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest a change in the turnover&#8208;limiting and selectivity&#8208;determining step induced by the optimal ligand. DFT calculations reveal that in the anti&#8208;Markovnikov pathway, repulsion between the ligand and the alkyl group is minimized (by virtue of it being 1&#176; versus 2&#176;) in the rate&#8208; and regioselectivity&#8208;determining transmetalation transition state.</dc:description>

      <title>Challenges and Opportunities in the Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Interlocked Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>Several strategies have been successfully utilized so far in order to obtain a wide range of interlocked molecules. However, some interlocked compounds are still not obtained directly and/or efficiently from non&#8208;interlocked components because the requisites for self&#8208;assembly cannot be always enforced. To circumvent such a synthetic problem, the strategy that consists in synthesizing an isolable and storable interlocked building block in a step that precedes its modifications is an appealing chemical route to more sophisticated interlocked molecules. Synthetic opportunities and challenges are closely linked to the fact that the mechanical bond might tremendously affect the reactivity of a function of the encircled axle, while the interlocked architecture need to be preserved during the synthesis. Hence, the mechanical bond plays a fundamental role in the strategy employed. This review focuses on the challenging post&#8208;synthetic modifications of interlocked molecules, sometimes through the cleavage of the axle&#8217;s main chain, and always with the conservation of the mechanical bond.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several strategies have been successfully utilized so far in order to obtain a wide range of interlocked molecules. However, some interlocked compounds are still not obtained directly and/or efficiently from non&#8208;interlocked components because the requisites for self&#8208;assembly cannot be always enforced. To circumvent such a synthetic problem, the strategy that consists in synthesizing an isolable and storable interlocked building block in a step that precedes its modifications is an appealing chemical route to more sophisticated interlocked molecules. Synthetic opportunities and challenges are closely linked to the fact that the mechanical bond might tremendously affect the reactivity of a function of the encircled axle, while the interlocked architecture need to be preserved during the synthesis. Hence, the mechanical bond plays a fundamental role in the strategy employed. This review focuses on the challenging post&#8208;synthetic modifications of interlocked molecules, sometimes through the cleavage of the axle&#8217;s main chain, and always with the conservation of the mechanical bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Membrane Chemistry Tunes the Structure of a Peptide Transporter</title>
      <dc:description>
Membrane transporters need to cycle through different conformations in order to perform function. Using state of the art smFRET tools, H. Hofmann, C. L&#246;w et&#8197;al. reveal in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202008226) that the dynamics and conformational variety of a peptide transporter is sensitively regulated by the lipid environment. Analyses in different lipid compositions highlight the influence of the lipid head&#8208;group while artificial detergents trap the transporter in a single conformation.

      <title>Co&#8208;assembly between Fmoc Diphenylalanine and Diphenylalanine within a 3D Fibrous Viscous Network Confers Atypical Curvature and Branching</title>
      <dc:description>Supramolecular polymer co&#8208;assembly is a useful approach to modulate peptide nanostructures. However, the co&#8208;assembly scenario where one of the peptide building blocks simultaneously forms a hydrogel is yet to be studied. Herein, we investigated the co&#8208;assembly formation of a minimalistic dipeptide, diphenylalanine (FF), and Fmoc&#8208;diphenylalanine (FmocFF) within the 3D fibrous matrix of FmocFF hydrogel. The overlapping peptide sequence between the two building blocks leads to their co&#8208;assembly within the gel state modulating the nature of the FF crystals. Consequently, we observe the formation of branched microcrystalline aggregates with an atypical curvature, in contrast to the FF assemblies obtained from aqueous solution. Using optical microscopy, we demonstrate the sigmoidal kinetic growth profile of these aggregates. Microfluidics and ToF&#8208;SIMS experiments reveal the presence of co&#8208;assembled structures of FF and FmocFF in the crystalline aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulation was further used to decipher the mechanism of co&#8208;assembly formation. This study introduces a simple methodology to investigate the kinetics of amyloidogenic structure formation in the hydrogel state and their  in vitro  modulation using the supramolecular co&#8208;assembly paradigm.</dc:description>

      <title>Cell Death Mediated by Pyroptosis Pathway with the Help of Nanotechnology: New Prospects for Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Pyroptosis, a unique form of programmed cell death (PCD) characterized by DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, cellular swelling with big bubbles and cell content leakage, has been proven to have close relationships with human diseases, such as inflammatory diseases and malignant tumors. Since a new gasdermin&#8208;D (GSDMD) protein was identified in 2015, various strategies have been developed to induce pyroptosis for cancer therapy, including ions, small molecular drugs and nanomaterials. Although there are a number of reviews about the pyroptosis mechanism, the summary covering the recent progresses of nanomedicines utilized in pyroptosis&#8208;based cancer therapy has not been presented. Therefore, it is urgent to fill this gap and light up future directions for using such a powerful tool to fight against cancer. In this Minireview, the recent progresses of cancer treatment based on pyroptosis induced by nanoparticles will be described in detail, the design highlights and the therapeutic advantages are emphasized, and finally future perspectives on this emerging area are proposed.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Conducting Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid Copper Sulfides CuxC6S6(X = 4 or 5.5): Ligand&#8208;based Oxidation Induced Chemical and Electronic Structure Modulation</title>
      <dc:description>Over the past few years, conductive coordination polymers (CPs) have received emerging attention as subjects in fundamental research or as prospective candidates for a wide range of applications because of their inherent structural and functional diversity and modularity. Several successful approaches have been used to construct CPs with high conductivity. However, obtaining CPs with high conductivity is considered a stepping stone in regards to the full design of a material, the next and more crucial step is to have the capability of controlling the electronic structure to fine&#8208;tune the properties of the materials for new, unique applications. Herein, taking advantage of the non&#8208;innocent nature of benzenehexathiol (BHT) ligand and the rich coordination capability of cooper(I) ions, two novel electrically conductive CPs (Cu  x  C  6  S  6  , x = 4 or 5.5) derived from the same organic linker and metal node (copper(I)) have been synthesized and studied. These two Cu  x  C  6  S  6  s materials display not only high electrical conductivity but also feature tunable structural topology and electronic structure. The high conductivity of this material originates from the presence of necessary charge transport pathways that facilitate conductivity within the material but more interestingly, offers control of the Fermi level through modulation of the oxidation level of the non&#8208;innocent redox&#8208;active ligand. As a result, both Cu  4  C  6  S  6  and Cu  5.5  C  6  S  6  act as degenerate semiconductors with desirable band structures that make Cu  5.5  C  6  S  6  a potential candidate as a p&#8208;type thermoelectric material with a ZT value of 0.12 at 390 K, a record&#8208;breaking performance for p&#8208;type CPs. These results demonstrate the flexibility of BHT for the construction of highly conductive CPs originated from the identical starting components with tunable stoichiometric composition and electrical performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Expeditious Total Synthesis of Hemiasterlin via a Convergent Multi&#8208;component Strategy and Its Use in Targeted Cancer Therapeutics</title>
      <dc:description>Hemiasterlin is an anti&#8208;mitotic marine natural product with reported sub&#8208;nanomolar potency against several cancer cell lines. Herein, we describe an expeditious total synthesis of hemiasterlin featuring a four&#8208;component Ugi reaction (Ugi&#8208;4CR) as the key step. The convergent synthetic strategy enabled rapid access to taltobulin (HTI&#8208;286), a similarly potent synthetic analogue. This short synthetic sequence enabled investigation of both hemiasterlin and taltobulin as cytotoxic payloads in antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs). These novel ADCs displayed sub&#8208;nanomolar cytotoxicity against HER2&#8208;expressing cancer cells, while showing no activity against antigen&#8208;negative cells. This study demonstrates an improved synthetic route to a highly valuable natural product, facilitating further investigation of hemiasterlin and its analogues as a potential payload in targeted therapeutics.</dc:description>

      <title>Chromophore&#8208;assisted proximity labeling of DNA reveals chromosomal organization in living cells</title>
      <dc:description>The spatial arrangement of chromosome within the nucleus is intimately linked to genome function and gene expression regulation. Existing genome&#8208;wide mapping methods to study chromosome organization often rely on chemically crosslinking DNA with protein baits, which raises concerns of introducing artefacts during cellular fixation. Herein, we developed a novel proximity&#8208;dependent DNA labeling method based on the chromophore&#8208;assisted nucleobase photooxidation. By genetically targeting a photosensitizer protein to specific subnuclear locations, we achieved blue light&#8208;activated labeling of local DNA with a bioorthogonal functional handle, which allowed subsequent affinity purification and sequence identification via next&#8208;generation sequencing. When applied to the nuclear lamina in human embryonic kidney 293T cells, our method revealed lamina&#8208;associated domains (LADs) that cover 37.6% of the genome. These LADs overlap with heterochromatin hallmarks including histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) and are depleted with CpG islands. This simple labeling method avoids the harsh treatment of chemical crosslinking and is generally applicable for the genome&#8208;wide high&#8208;resolution mapping of the spatial chromosome organization in living cells.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites have been widely applied in optoelectronic fields, but their poor stability hinders their actual applications.

The zeolite matrix provides quantum confinement for perovskite nanocrystals achieving efficient green emission, and passivates the defects of perovskite by H&#8208;bonding interaction leading to longer lifetime compare to bulk perovskite film. Furthermore, the AlPO&#8208;5 zeolite also acts as protection shield and enables ultrahigh stability of perovskite nanocrystals under 150&#186;C heat stress, under 15&#8208;month long&#8208;term ambient exposure, and even in water for more than 2 weeks, respectively. The strategy of  in situ  passivation and encapsulation for the perovskite@AlPO&#8208;5 composite has been demonstrated universal from MA&#8208;based to Cs&#8208;based perovskites.

      <title>An Ester&#8208;substituted Semiconducting Polymer with Efficient Nonradiative Decay Enhances NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Performance for Monitoring of Tumor Growth</title>
      <dc:description>Photoacoustic&#160;agents have been of vital importance for improving the imaging contrast and reliability against self&#8208;interference from endogenous substances. Herein, we synthesized a series of thiadiazoloquinoxaline (TQ)&#8208;based semiconducting polymers (SPs) with a broad absorption covering from NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II regions. Among them, the excited s&#8208;BDT&#8208;TQE, a repeating unit of SPs, shows a large dihedral angle and narrow adiabatic energy as well as low radiative decay, attributing to its strongly electron&#8208;deficient ester&#8208;substituted TQ&#8208;segment. In addition, its more vigorous molecular motions trigger a higher reorganization energy that further yields an efficient photoinduced nonradiative decay, which has been carefully examined and understood by theoretical calculation. Thus, BDT&#8208;TQE SP&#8208;cored nanoparticles with twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) feature exhibit a high NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion efficiency (61.6%) and preferable photoacoustic tracking of  in situ  hepatic tumor growth for more than 20 days. This study highlights a unique strategy for constructing efficient NIR&#8208;II PA agents  via  TICT&#8208;enhanced PNRD effect, further advancing their applications for  in vivo  bioimaging.</dc:description>

The most striking character is that the photoanode exhibits a strong &#8220;self&#8208;healing&#8221; property on photostability over 100 h under intermittent test.

      <dc:description>Although N&#8208;alkenoxyheteroarenium salts have been widely used as umpoled synthons with nucleophilic (hetero)arenes, the use of electron&#8208;poor heteroarenes has remained unexplored.

Experimental and computational studies support the traceless operation of a nucleophile, which enables the previously inaccessible transformation of N&#8208;alkenoxyheteroarenium salts. Remarkably, the generality of this strategy has been further demonstrated by broad applications in the regioselective C&#8211;H functionalization of other electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes such as phenanthridine, isoquinoline, and pyridine N&#8208;oxides, offering a practical tool for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex biorelevant molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Switching the Photoluminescence and Electrochemiluminescence of Liposoluble Porphyrin in Aqueous Phase by Molecular Regulation</title>
      <dc:description>A facile molecular structure regulation strategy was exploited to potentially transform the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) chromophore of lipsoluble porphyrin to the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active in aqueous phase. By peripheral decoration of 5&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;10,15,20&#8208;triphenylporphyrin (ATPP) with inherent AIE active tetraphenylethene (TPE), a versatile AIEgenic porphyrin derivative (ATPP&#8208;TPE) was obtained, which greatly abolishes the detrimental &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and thus surmounts the notorious ACQ effect of ATPP in aqueous phase. The photoluminescence of ATPP&#8208;TPE is 4.5&#8208;fold stronger than ATPP at aggregation state. Moreover, an unequivocal aggregation induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL) of ATPP&#8208;TPE was found seriously dependent on its aggregation property in aqueous solution with efficiency of 34%, which is 6 times higher than pure ATPP.

      <dc:description>A new class of bio&#8208;based and fully degradable block polyesters are pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives. Bio&#8208;based monomers are efficiently polymerized to make block polyesters with controlled compositions. They show high peel adhesions (4&#8208;13 N cm  &#8208;1  ), controllable storage and loss moduli and are removed by adhesive failure.

      <title>Activating Antibacterial Effect of 4,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrimidinethiol&#8208;modified Gold Nanoparticles by Reducing their Sizes</title>
      <dc:description>Adequately decorated gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have excellent antibiotic activities against multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria. Nanoparticles exhibiting Gram selective antibacterial actions are beneficial to precise therapy. Here, we present a strategy to tune antibacterial spectrum of a small molecule (4,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrimidinethiol, DAPT)&#8208;modified DGNPs (DAPT&#8208;GNPs, DGNPs) by adjusting their sizes. Compared to large (~14 nm in diameter) DGNPs (lDGNPs) and medium&#8208;sized (3&#8208;4 nm in diameter) DGNPs (mDGNPs), which have no antibacterial effect or only target Gram negative (G&#8208;) bacteria, ultrasmall DGNPs (uDGNPs, &lt;2 nm) exhibit broad antibacterial spectrum, especially showing an over 60&#8208;fold increase in antibacterial efficacy against Gram positive (G+) bacteria. Moreover, the uDGNPs&#8208;functionalized scaffolds (agarose gel) can serve as general wound dressings for healing burnt infections. Together, our strategy, tuning antibacterial spectrum by modulating particle size, is insightful for exploring novel properties of the nanomaterials and their applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhancing CO2 Electroreduction to Methane with Cobalt Phthalocyanine and Zinc&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Carbon Tandem Catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>Developing copper&#8208;free catalysts for CO  2  conversion into hydrocarbons and oxygenates is highly desirable for electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR). Herein, we report a cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) and zinc&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C) tandem catalyst for CO  2  RR to CH  4  . This tandem catalyst shows more than 100 times  enhancement in CH  4  /CO production rate ratio  compared with CoPc or Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C alone. Density functional theory calculations and electrochemical CO reduction reaction results suggest that CO  2  is firstly reduced into CO over CoPc and then CO diffuses onto Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C for further conversion into CH  4  over Zn&#8208;N  4  site, decoupling complicated CO  2  RR pathway on single active site into a two&#8208;step tandem reaction. Moreover, mechanistic analysis indicates that CoPc not only generates CO but also enhances the availability of *H over adjacent N sites in Zn&#8208;N  4  , which is the key to achieve the high CH  4  production rate and understand intriguing electrocatalytic behavior distinctive to copper&#8208;based tandem catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [4+1] and [5+1] Annulation of Arenes and 1,3&#8208;Enynes: Distinct Mechanism of Allyl Formation and Allyl Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>Metal allyl species are versatile intermediates in a number of coupling reactions. However, Rh(III) &#960;&#8208;allyls have been rarely elaborated in the context of asymmetric C&#8208;H functionalization. Reported herein is chiral Rh(III) cyclopentadienyl&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of lactams and isochromenes via oxidative [4+1] and [5+1] annulation, respectively, between arenes and 1,3&#8208;enynes. The reaction proceeds via a C&#8208;H activation, alkenyl to allyl rearrangement, and nucleophilic cyclization cascade. The mechanistic details of the [4+1] annulation of N&#8208;methoxybenzamide and an 1,3&#8208;enyne have been elucidated by a combination of experimental and computational methods. DFT studies indicate that following the C&#8208;H activation and alkyne insertion, a Rh(III) alkenyl intermediate undergoes &#948;&#8208;hydrogen elimination of the allylic C&#8208;H via a six&#8208;membered ring transition state to produce a Rh(III) enallene hydride intermediate. Subsequent hydride insertion and allyl rearrangement affords several rhodium(III) allyl intermediates, and a rare Rh(III) &#951;4 ene&#8208;allyl species with &#960;&#8208;agostic interaction undergoes SN2'&#8208;type external attack by the nitrogen nucleophile, instead of C&#8208;N reductive elimination, as the stereodetermining step.</dc:description>

      <title>1D Coordination &#960;&#8208;d Conjugated Polymers with Distinct Structures Defined by the Choice of the Transition Metal: Towards a New Class of Antiaromatic Macrocycles</title>
      <dc:description>Recently &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination polymers have received a lot of attention due to their unique material properties, although synthesis of long and defect free polymers remains challenging. Here we introduce a novel on&#8208;surface synthesis of coordination polymers with quinoidal ligand under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions, which enables formation of flexible coordination polymers with lengths up to hundreds of nanometers. Moreover, this procedure allows the incorporation of different transition metal atoms tuning their coordination between four and two&#8208;fold. Remarkably, the two&#8208;fold coordination mode revealed the formation of wires constituted by (electronically) independent 12&#8208;membered antiaromatic macrocycles linked together through two C&#8208;C single bonds.</dc:description>

      <title>Overcoming Symmetry Mismatch in Vaccine Nanoassembly via Spontaneous Amidation</title>
      <dc:description>Matching of symmetry at interfaces is a fundamental obstacle in molecular assembly. Virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) are important platforms to generate vaccines against pathogenic threats including Covid&#8208;19. However, symmetry mismatch between multimeric antigens and VLP subunits can prohibit vaccine nanoassembly. Here we explore spontaneous amidation to establish principles for coupling VLPs to diverse antigen symmetries. SpyTag003/SpyCatcher003&#8208;mediated decoration enabled efficient VLP conjugation and extreme thermal resilience. Many people showed pre&#8208;existing antibodies to SpyTag:SpyCatcher, but decreased antibodies against 003 variants. We coupled efficiently to the computationally&#8208;designed VLP, built from twenty trimers, not only monomers (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) but also cyclic dimers (Newcastle Disease Virus or Lyme disease), trimers (Influenza Hemagglutinins), and tetramers (Influenza Neuraminidases). Even small antigens with dihedral symmetry could be displayed. For the global challenge of Influenza, Spy&#8208;display enabled powerful induction of neutralizing antibodies to trimeric and tetrameric antigens. SpyCatcher003 conjugation is compatible with nanodisplay of diverse symmetries, towards generation of potent vaccines.</dc:description>

      <title>An Electrochromic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Film</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (HOFs) possess merits such as high porosity, tunable structure, facile modification, and easy regeneration, which, however, have yet to be brought into play for exploring new functional HOF materials. In this study, an electrochromic HOF film was first time reported. The electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method applied here generated a transparent film at room temperature in merely 2 minutes, being facile, efficient, low&#8208;cost, and applicable to other HOFs. The resulted film exhibits reversible electrochromic property with the advantages of long cycle life (&gt;500 cycles). More strikingly, such an all&#8208;organic film can be easily regenerated (through rinsing with DMF and re&#8208;deposition) and shows tunable electrochromic behavior (via low&#8208;cost post&#8208;synthetic modification) capable of successive color changes, which is hardly achieved by conventional electrochromic materials. With the above&#8208;mentioned advantages, an electrochromic device is manufactured to further demonstrate its application potential. The work presented here may open a new avenue toward preparing HOF films for broad practical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Anionic Aliovalent Substitution from Structure Models of ZnS: Novel Defect Diamond&#8208;like Halopnictide Infrared Nonlinear Optical Materials with Wide Band Gaps and Large SHG Effects</title>
      <dc:description>To design pnictide nonlinear optical materials with wide band gap and large second&#8208;harmonic generation, the heavy halogen I was introduced into pnictides through anionic aliovalent substitution with diamond&#8208;like ZnS as templates.

      <title>Direct&#8208;Space Structure Determination of Covalent Organic Frameworks from 3D Electron Diffraction Data</title>
      <dc:description>Structure determination of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) at atomic precision is a bottle&#8208;neck that hinders the development of COF chemistry. Although three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D&#8208;ED) data has been used to solve structures of sub&#8208;micrometre sized COFs, successful structure solution is not guaranteed as the data resolution is usually low. Herein, we demonstrate that  the direct&#8208;space strategy for structure solution, implemented using a genetic algorithm (GA), is a successful approach for structure determination of COF&#8208;300 from 3D&#8208;ED data.  Structural models with different geometric constraints were considered in the GA calculations, with successful structure solution achieved from room&#8208;temperature 3D&#8208;ED data with resolution as low as  ca  . 3.78 &#197;. The generality of this strategy is further verified for different phases of COF&#8208;300. This study demonstrates a viable strategy for structure solution of COF materials from 3D&#8208;ED data of limited resolution, which may facilitate the discovery of new COF materials in the future.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A facile approach to assemble catalase&#8208;like photosensitizing nanozymes with a self&#8208;oxygen&#8208;supplying ability was developed. The process involved Fe  3+  &#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc)&#8208;protected amino acids. By adding a zinc(II) phthalocyanine&#8208;based photosensitizer (ZnPc) and the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1 (HIF&#8208;1) inhibitor acriflavine (ACF) during the Fe  3+  &#8208;promoted self&#8208;assembly of Fmoc&#8208;protected cysteine (Fmoc&#8208;Cys), the nanovesicles Fmoc&#8208;Cys/Fe@Pc and Fmoc&#8208;Cys/Fe@Pc/ACF were prepared, which could be disassembled intracellularly. The released Fe  3+  could catalyze the transformation of H  2  O  2  enriched in cancer cells to oxygen efficiently, thereby ameliorating the hypoxic condition and promoting the photosensitizing activity of the released ZnPc. With an additional therapeutic component, Fmoc&#8208;Cys/Fe@Pc/ACF exhibited higher in vitro and in vivo photodynamic activities than Fmoc&#8208;Cys/Fe@Pc, demonstrating the synergistic effect of ZnPc and ACF.</dc:description>

      <title>Impact of Ethylene on Efficiency and Stereocontrol in Olefin Metathesis : When to Add It, When to Remove It, and When to Avoid It</title>
      <dc:description>E    thylene is the byproduct of olefin metathesis reactions that involve one or more terminal alkenes. Ethylene&#8217;s volatility is one reason why many cross&#8208;metathesis or ring&#8208;closing metathesis processes, which are reversible transformations, are efficient. However, because ethylene can be converted to a methylidene complex, which is a highly reactive but relatively unstable species, its concentration can impact olefin metathesis in other ways. In some cases, introducing excess ethylene can increase reaction rate owing to faster catalyst initiation. Ethylene and a derived methylidene complex can also advantageously inhibit substrate or product homocoupling, and/or divert a less selective pathway. In other instances, a methylidene&#8217;s low stability and high activity may lead to erosion of efficiency and/or kinetic selectivity, making it preferable that ethylene is removed while being generated. If methylidene decomposition is so fast that there is little or no product formation, it is best that ethylene and methylidene complex formation is avoided altogether. This is accomplished by the use of di&#8208; or trisubstituted alkenes in stereoretentive processes, which includes adopting methylene capping strategy. Here, we analyze the different scenarios through which ethylene and the involvement of methylidene complexes can be manipulated and managed so that an olefin metathesis reaction may occur more efficiently and/or more stereoselectively.</dc:description>

      <title>Control of surface barriers in mass transfer to modulate methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins reaction over SAPO&#8208;34 zeolites</title>
      <dc:description>Mass transfer of guest molecules has great impact on the applications of nanoporous crystalline materials and particularly the shape selective catalysis over zeolites. Control of mass transfer to alter reaction over zeolites, however, remains an open challenge. Recent studies show that, in addition to intracrystalline diffusion, surface barriers represent another transport mechanism which may dominate the overall mass transport rate in zeolites. Here, we demonstrate the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) reaction can be modulated by&#160;regulating surface permeability in SAPO&#8208;34 zeolites with improved chemical liquid deposition and acid etching. Our results explicitly show the reduction of surface barriers can prolong catalyst lifetime and promote light olefins selectivity, which opens a potential avenue for improving reaction performance by controlling the mass transport of guest molecules in zeolite catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Pushing the limits of precious metal atom economy for three&#8208;way&#8208;catalysts (TWC): thermally stable and highly active single Rh atom catalysts (Rh1/ceria) for NO abatement</title>
      <dc:description>We show for the first time that atomically dispersed Rh cations on ceria, prepared via high&#8208;temperature atom trapping synthesis, are the active species for (CO+NO) reaction. This provides a direct link with the organometallic homogeneous Rh(I) complexes capable of catalyzing dry (CO+NO) reaction but without the stability concern. In particular, thermally stable Rh cations in 0.1wt% Rh1/CeO2 achieve full NO conversion with a TOF of ~ 330 hr&#8208;1 per Rh atom at 120 &#8304;C.&#160; Under dry conditions, the main product above 100 &#8304;C is N2 with N2O being the minor product. The presence of water promotes low&#8208;temperature activity of 0.1wt% Rh1/CeO2 starting at 50 &#8304;C with full NO conversion at ~120 &#8304;C. In the case with the wet stream, however, ammonia and nitrogen are the main products with only minor N2O amounts. NH3 formation at such low temperatures is attractive because of the potential to use this as a passive SCR system. Because of the uniformity of Rh ions on the support, we are able to observe the intermediates of (CO+NO) reaction via infrared measurements on Rh cations on zeolite and ceria. Furthermore, we show that ammonia formation correlates with the WGS activity of the material and thus, rhodium hydride Rh&#8208;H species are involved in this reaction: we detect Rh(CO)Hx species on ceria using isotopic IR measurements. These findings provide new mechanistic understanding for the catalytically active species in TWC catalysis and open up a new avenue for the synthesis of novel emissions control catalysts with 100% atom economy of ultra&#8208;expensive precious metals such as Rh.</dc:description>

      <title>Conductive and Elastic TiO2 Nanofibrous Aerogels: A New Concept toward Self&#8208;Supported Electrocatalysts with Superior Activity and Durability</title>
      <dc:description>Recently, various titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanostructures have received increasing attention in the fields of energy conversion and storage due to extraordinary electrochemical properties. However, these particulate nanomaterials exclusively exist in the powder form, which may cause health risks and environmental hazards. Here we report a novel, highly elastic bulk form of TiO2  for safe use and easy recycling. Specifically, TiO2  nanofibrous aerogels (NAs) consisting of resiliently bonded, flexible TiO2  nanofibers are constructed, which are featured by ultralow bulk density, ultrahigh porosity, and excellent elasticity. To further promote the charge transfer, they are subjected to the lithium reduction to generate abundant oxygen vacancies, which can modulate the electronic structures of TiO2, resulting in a conductivity up to 38.2 mS cm&#8211;1. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the conductive and elastic TiO2  NAs serve as a new type of self&#8208;supported electrocatalysts for ambient nitrogen fixation, achieving an ammonia yield of 4.19&#215;10&#8211;10  mol s&#8211;1  cm&#8211;2  and a Faradaic efficiency of 20.3% as determined by the indophenol blue method. The origin of the superior electrocatalytic activity is revealed by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Renal Secretion Pathway&#8208;dependent Efflux Transport Enabled Hyperfluorescence Imaging of Kidney Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>Renal tubular secretion is an active efflux pathway for the kidneys to remove molecules but has never been used to enhance kidney cancer targeting. Herein, we report the first renal tubule&#8208;secretable near infrared&#8208;emitting fluorophore, indocyanine green (ICG) conjugated with a 2100 Da PEG molecule (ICG&#8208;PEG45) and its advantages in hyperfluorescence imaging of kidney cancers, which cannot be achieved with hepatobiliary&#8208; and glomerular&#8208;clearable ICG. This pathway&#8208;dependent targeting of kidney cancer fundamentally arises from the fact that the secretion pathway enabled ICG&#8208;PEG45 to be effectively effluxed out of normal proximal tubules through P&#8208;glycoprotein transporter while being retained in the kidney cancerous tissues with low P&#8208;glycoprotein expression. Tuning elimination pathways and utilizing different efflux kinetics of medical agents in normal and diseased tissues could be a new strategy, in addition to well&#8208;known vasculature&#8208;based passive and ligand&#8208;receptor mediated active targeting, for tackling challenges in disease diagnosis and treatments.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning gate&#8208;opening of a flexible metal&#8208;organic framework for ternary gas sieving separation</title>
      <dc:description>In comparison with the fast development of binary mixture separations, ternary mixture separations are significantly more difficult and have rarely been realized by a single material. Herein, a new strategy of tuning the gate&#8208;opening pressure of flexible MOFs is developed to tackle such a challenge. As demonstrated by a flexible framework NTU&#8208;65, the gate&#8208;opening pressure of ethylene (C2H4), acetylene (C2H2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) can be regulated by temperatures. Therefore, efficient sieving separation of this ternary mixture was realized. Under optimized temperature, NTU&#8208;65 adsorbed a large amount of C2H2 and CO2 through gate&#8208;opening and only negligible amount of C2H4. Breakthrough experiments demonstrated that this material can simultaneously capture C2H2 and CO2, yielding polymer grade (&gt;99.99%) C2H4 from single breakthrough separation.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal halide regulated photophysical turning of zero&#8208;dimensional organic metal halide hybrids: from efficient phosphorescence to ultralong afterglow.</title>
      <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids have emerged as a new class of luminescent materials with exceptional structural and photophysical tunability, thanks to the rich choices of organic cations and metal halides for the formation of ionically bonded systems. Here we report photophysical tuning of a series of tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP) metal halide hybrids containing distinct metal halides, TPP  2  MX  n  (MX  n  = SbCl  5  , MnCl  4  , ZnCl  4  , ZnCl  2  Br  2  , ZnBr  4  ), from efficient phosphorescence to ultralong afterglow. It is found that the afterglow properties of TPP  +  cations could be suspended for the hybrids containing low bandgap emissive metal halide species, such as SbCl  5  2&#8208;  and MnCl  4  2&#8208;  , but significantly enhanced for the hybrids containing wide bandgap non&#8208;emissive ZnCl  4  2&#8208;  . Structural and photophysical studies reveal that the enhanced afterglow is attributed to stronger &#960; &#8208; &#960; stacking and intermolecular electronic coupling between TPP  +  cations in TPP  2  ZnCl  4  than in the pristine organic ionic compound TPPCl. Moreover, the afterglow in TPP  2  ZnX  4  can be tuned by controlling the halide composition, with the change from Cl to Br resulting in a shorter afterglow due to heavy atom effect.</dc:description>

      <title>Binuclear&#8208;Aluminum&#8208;Complex Modified Dendritic Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles as Unprecedented Adjuvants: Coordination Chemistry Dictates Adjuvanticity</title>
      <dc:description>Aluminum&#8208;containing adjuvants used in vaccine formulations suffer from low cellular immunity, severe aggregation and cerebral accumulation problems. Conventional aluminosilicates widely used in chemical industry focus mainly on acidic sites for catalytic applications, but are rarely used as adjuvants. We report an innovative &#8220;ligand&#8208;assisted steric hindrance&#8221; strategy to create a high density of six&#8208;coordinate  VI  Al&#8208;OH groups with basicity on dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles as new nanoadjuvants to address the challenges. Compared to four&#8208;coordinate  IV  Al modified counter&#8208;parts,  VI  Al&#8208;OH rich aluminosilicate nanoadjuvants enhance cellular delivery of antigens and provoke stronger cellular immunity. Moreover, the aluminum accumulation in brain is reduced than a commercial adjuvant. Our results have shown that coordination chemistry can be used to control the adjuvanticity, providing new understandings in the development of next&#8208;generation vaccine adjuvants.</dc:description>

      <title>A Polymorphic Azobenzene Cage for Energy Efficient and Highly Selective p&#8208;Xylene Separation</title>
      <dc:description>Developing the competency of molecular sorbents for energy&#8208;saving applications, such as C8 separations, requires efficient, stable, scalable and easily recyclable materials that can readily transition to commercial implementation. Here, we report an azobenzene&#8208;based cage for the selective separation of&#160;  p  &#8208;xylene isomer across a range of C8 isomers in both vapor and liquid states with selectivity that is higher than the reported all&#8208;organic sorbents. Interestingly, the crystal structure shows non&#8208;porous cages that are separated by&#160;  p&#8208;  xylene molecules through selective CH&#8230; p &#160;interactions between the azo bonds and the methyl hydrogens of the xylene molecules. This cage is stable in solution and can be regenerated directly under vacuum to be used in multiple cycles. We envisage that this work will promote the investigation of the azo bond as well as guest induced crystal to crystal phase transition in non&#8208;porous organic solids for pivotal energy intensive separations.</dc:description>

      <title>Design of a Single&#8208;Atom Indium&#948;+&#8208;N4 Interface for Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 to Formate</title>
      <dc:description>Main group Indium (In) is a promising electrocatalyst which triggers CO2 reduction to formate, while the high overpotential and low Faradaic efficiency (FE) hinder its practical application. Herein, we rationally design a new In single atom catalyst containing exclusive isolated In&#948;+&#8208;N4 atomic interface sites for CO2 electroreduction to formate with high efficiency. This catalyst exhibites an extremely large turnover frequency (TOF) up to 12500 h&#8722;1 at &#8208;0.95 V vs. RHE, with FE for formate of 96 % and current density of 8.87 mA cm&#8722;2 at low potential of &#8722;0.65 V vs. RHE.
