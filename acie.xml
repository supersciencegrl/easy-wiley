         <title>Double&#8208;Modification Oriented Design of a Deep&#8208;UV Birefringent Crystal Functionalized by [B12O16F4(OH)4] Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polarization modulation of deep&#8208;UV light is of great significance to the current technologies, and to this end, birefringent crystal has emerged as an invaluable material as it allows for the effective light modulation. Herein, double&#8208;modification strategy driven by F and OH anions that makes double effects towards the critical property enhancement of deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystals is proposed. This leads to the discovery of a new hydroxyborate (NH 4  ) 4  [B 12  O 16  F 4  (OH) 4  ] with unprecedented giant cluster as a deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystal with large birefringence (&#916; n  exp.  = 0.12@546 nm). Such a birefringence sets a record among inorganic hydroxyborates with experimentally measured birefringence. The [B 12  O 16  F 4  (OH) 4  ] cluster in near&#8208;plane arrangement is enabled by the hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions; and it is theoretically confirmed to be optical&#8208;active for large birefringence and band gap, in which the &#960;&#8208;conjugated modules, [BO 3  ] and [BO 2  (OH)], are the main sources of large optical anisotropy.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational electrolyte design toward cyclability remedy for room&#8211;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries are a promising energy storage technology, owing to the merits of high energy density and low cost. However, their electrochemical performance has been severely hindered by the poor compatibility between the existing electrolytes and the electrodes. Here, we demonstrate an all&#8208;fluorinated electrolyte, containing 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;N, N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (FDMA) solvent, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl methyl ether (MTFE) anti&#8208;solvent and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive, can greatly enhance the reversibility and cyclability of RT Na&#8208;S batteries. A NaF&#8208; and Na3N&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase derived from FDMA and FEC enables a &#8220;quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;phase&#8221; Na&#8208;S conversion, eliminating the shuttle of polysulfides. The MTFE not only reduces polysulfide dissolution, but also further stabilizes Na anode via a tailored solvation structure. The as&#8208;developed RT Na&#8208;S batteries deliver a high capacity, long lifespan, and enhanced safety.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt Silylenes as Platforms for Catalytic Nitrene&#8208;Group Transfer by Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cobalt silylene (Co=Si) linkage enables a distinct metal/ligand cooperative activation of an organic azide, where nitrene transfer occurs to and from the Co&#183;&#183;&#183;Si linkage without ligand dissociation from the 18&#8208;electron cobalt center. This process utilizes the orthogonal binding affinities of the silicon and cobalt sites to avoid CO poisoning that would otherwise inhibit reactivity, leading to significantly improved catalytic isocyanate generation compared with related systems. The dual&#8208;site approach demonstrates the potential of metal/main&#8208;group bonds to access new and efficient catalytic pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Enantioselective &#946;&#8208;Hydroxylation of Unactivated C&#8211;H Bonds in Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic selective hydroxylation of unactivated aliphatic (sp3) C&#8211;H bonds without a directing group represents a formidable task for synthetic chemists. Through directed evolution of P450BS&#946; hydroxylase, we realize oxyfunctionalization of unactivated C&#8211;H bonds in a broad spectrum of aliphatic carboxylic acids with varied chain lengths, functional groups and (hetero&#8208;)aromatic moieties in a highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselective fashion (&gt;30 examples, C&#946;/C&#945;&gt;20:1, &gt;99% ee). The X&#8208;ray structure of the evolved variant, P450BS&#946;&#8208;L78I/Q85H/G290I, in complex with palmitic acid well rationalizes the experimentally observed regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, and also reveals a reduced catalytic pocket volume that accounts for the increased reactivity with smaller substrates. This work showcases the potential of employing a biocatalyst to enable a chemical transformation that is particularly challenging by chemical methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Production of C3 &#8211; C6 Acetate Esters via CO Electroreduction in a Membrane Electrode Assembly Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic carbon monoxide reduction has been previously reported to yield a range of carbonaceous products including alcohols, hydrocarbons and carboxylic acids. However, esters, an important family of organic compounds, have not been formed. Herein, we report the electrosynthesis of C3  to C6  acetate esters (H3C&#8208;(C=O)&#8208;O&#8208;R) from carbon monoxide using copper catalysts in a membrane electrode assembly cell. Ethyl acetate and propyl acetate could be produced with an unprecedented total Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ~22 % and with a current density up to &#8211;55&#160;mA/cm2  , alongside minor quantities of methyl acetate and butyl acetate. The esters are produced via the addition reaction of ethenone&#160;(H2C=C=O) and alcohols produced during CO reduction.&#160;We show that the near water&#8208;free reaction condition and the high local pH play key roles in the formation of the esters.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Aptamers with Selectively Enhanced Biostability in the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamers are emerging as promising molecular tools in cancer&#8208;targeted theranostics. Improving their  in vivo  stability has been a critical issue in promoting the clinical translation, but such efforts could lead to more serious side effects resulting from prolonged retention in normal organs. To address this problem, we developed an environment&#8208;responsive stabilization strategy for selective enhancement of aptamer biostability in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Briefly, with the end extension of an ATP Responsive Protection (ARP) module, the designed aptamer could be protected from nuclease degradation through the specific incorporation of ATP. Based on our  in vivo  results, this ARP&#8208;aptamer probe could be effectively accumulated in tumor via aptamer&#8208;based molecular recognition. It showed selectively prolonged tumor retention time, but rapid digestion in normal organs. Our strategy was expected to&#160;provide a new paradigm for the development of organ&#8208;specific nucleic acid&#8208;based imaging and therapeutic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Zeolitic Hollow&#8208;Fiber Membranes by a Viscosity&#8208;Confined Dry Gel Conversion Process for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Zeolite membranes show great potential for gas and hydrocarbon separations, but high manufacturing cost has been one of the main hurdles in their industrial application. Here we demonstrate a method termed viscosity&#8208;confined dry gel conversion (VCDGC) for zeolite hollow fiber membrane fabrication. We demonstrate in detail the VCDGC synthesis of small&#8208;pore CHA zeolite membranes. Extensive permeation measurements reveal that dry gel&#8208;processed CHA zeolite hollow fiber membranes have excellent gas and hydrocarbon separation characteristics well exceeding or comparable to current membranes. Medium&#8208;pore MFI membranes are also fabricated, and their favorable hydrocarbon separation characteristics indicate the versatility and reliability of the VCDGC method.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are promising for high resolution OLEDs, but concurrent optimization of excited&#8208;state dynamics and color purity remains a tough challenge. Herein, three deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF compounds (  BN1  &#8208;  BN3  ) featuring gradually enlarged ring&#8208;fused structure and increased rigidity are accessed by lithium&#8208;free borylation in high yields from the same precursor, which all possess CIE  y  below 0.08. Structure&#8208;property investigation demonstrates a strategic implementation of improving oscillator strength (  f  osc  ) and accelerating reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process by extending the &#960;&#8208;skeleton, where  BN3  realizes a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.6% and reduced roll&#8208;off, representing the best efficiency reported for deep&#8208;blue TADF OLEDs. The internal regulation of efficiency and color purity of these compounds validate the general effectiveness to achieve advanced deep&#8208;blue narrowband emitters with higher&#8208;order boron/nitrogen&#8208;based MR&#8208;motifs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reactivity of phosphaalkynes, the isolobal and isoelectronic congeners to alkynes, with metal alkylidyne complexes is explored in this work. Treating the tungsten alkylidyne [  t  BuOCO]W&#8801;C  t  Bu(THF)  2  (  1  ) with phosphaalkyne (  10  ) results in the formation of [O  2  C(  t  BuC&#9552;)W{  &#951;  2  &#8208;(  P  ,  C  )&#8208;P&#8801;C&#8211;Ad}(THF)] (  13&#8208;  t  Bu  THF  ) and [O  2  C(AdC&#9552;)W{  &#951;  2  &#8208;(  P  ,  C  )&#8208;P&#8801;C&#8211;  t  Bu}(THF)] (  13&#8208;Ad  THF  ); derived from the formal reductive migratory insertion of the alkylidyne moiety into a W&#8211;C  arene  bond. Analogous to alkyne metathesis, a stable phosphametallacyclobutadiene complex [  t  BuOCO]W[  &#954;  2  &#8208;C(  t  Bu)PC(Ad)] (  14  ) forms upon loss of THF from the coordination sphere of either  13&#8208;  t  Bu  THF  or  13&#8208;Ad  THF  .

         <title>Chiral Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters Exhibiting Narrowband Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence with EQE of 37.2%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emitters with narrowband emission remain a formidable challenge for circularly polarized OLEDs (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Here, a promising strategy for developing chiral emitters concurrently featuring multi&#8208;resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) and circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is demonstrated by the integration of molecular rigidity, central chirality and MR effect. A pair of chiral green emitters denoted as (  R  )&#8208;  BN&#8208;MeIAc  and (  S  )&#8208;  BN&#8208;MeIAc  is designed. Benefited by the rigid and quasi&#8208;planar MR&#8208;framework, the enantiomers not only display mirror&#8208;image CPL spectra, but also exhibit TADF properties with high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96%, narrow FWHM of 30 nm, and high horizontal dipole orientation of 90% in doped film. Consequently, the enantiomer&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs achieved excellent external quantum efficiencies of 37.2% with very low efficiency roll&#8208;off, representing the highest device efficiency of all the reported CP&#8208;OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chiral hybrid metal halides with a high dissymmetry factor (  g  lum  ) and a superior photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) are promising candidates for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) light sources. Here, we report eight new chiral hybrid manganese halides, crystallizing in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group  P  2  1  2  1  2  1  and showing intense CPL emissions. Oppositely&#8208;signed circular dichroism (CD) and CPL signals are detected according to the  R  &#8208; and  S  &#8208;configurations of the chiral alkanolammonium cations. Time&#8208;resolved PL spectra show long averaged decay lifetimes up to 1 ms for (  R  &#8208;3&#8208;quinuclidinol)MnBr  3  (  R  &#8208;  1  ). The  g  lum  of polycrystalline samples for coordinated structures (23&#215;10  &#8211;3  ) is doubled compared with the non&#8208;coordinated ones (8.5&#215;10  &#8211;3  ), due to the structural variations.  R  &#8208;  1  exhibit both a high  g  lum  and a high PLQY (50.2%).

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Meinwald Rearrangement with an Unusual Regioselective and Stereospecific 1,2&#8209;Methyl Shift</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Meinwald rearrangement is a synthetically useful reaction but often lacks regioselectivity and stereocontrol. A significant challenge in the Meinwald rearrangement of internal epoxides is the non&#8208;regioselective migration of different substituents to give a mixture of products. Herein, an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed regioselective and stereospecific 1,2&#8208;methyl shift in the Meinwald rearrangement of internal epoxides is reported. Styrene oxide isomerase (SOI) catalyzed the unique isomerization of internal epoxides through 1,2&#8208;methyl shift without 1,2&#8208;hydride shift to give the corresponding aldehydes and a cyclic ketone as the sole product. SOI&#8208;catalyzed isomerization showed high stereospecificity, fully retaining stereoconfiguration. The synthetic utility of this enzymatic Meinwald rearrangement was demonstrated by its incorporation into three new types of enantioselective cascades, to convert&#160;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyl styrenes into the corresponding (R)&#8208;alcohols, acids, or amines in high ee and yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancement in Plasmon&#8208;induced Photoelectrocatalytic Water Oxidation over Au/TiO2 with Lithium Intercalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmon&#8208;induced chemical reaction is an emerging field but its development faces huge challenges because of low quantum  efficiency  . Herein, we report that the solar energy conversion efficiency of Au/TiO2  in plasmon&#8208;induced water oxidation is greatly enhanced by intercalating Li+  into TiO2  .  The incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency as high as 2.0%@520 nm is achieved by Au/Li0.2TiO2  in photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation, realizing a 33&#8208;fold enhancement in photocurrent density compared with Au/TiO2  . The superior photoelectrocatalytic performance is mainly ascribed to the enhanced electric conductivity and higher catalytic activity of Li0.2TiO2  . Furthermore, the ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy suggests that lithium intercalation into TiO2  could change the dynamics of hot electron relaxation in Au nanoparticles. This work demonstrates that intercalation alkaline ions into semiconductors can promote the charge separation efficiency of the plasmonic effect of Au/TiO2  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The stereospecific sigmatropic [1,5] carbon shift of C3 ammonium enolates is discovered. According to mechanistic, kinetic and computational experiments, this new rearrangement proceeds via the catalytic generation of a transient C3 ammonium enolate by intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition. This intermediate rapidly undergoes [1,5] sigmatropic carbon migration to furnish the respective tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;4&#8208;ones with excellent diastereoselectivities of d.r. &gt; 99:1 and in 61&#8208;98% yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Fluorinated Isochromans via Iodine(I)/Iodine(III) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The success of saturated, fluorinated heterocycles in contemporary drug discovery provides a stimulus for creative endeavor in main group catalysis. Motivated by the ubiquity of isochromans across the bioactive small molecule spectrum, the prominence of the anomeric effect in regulating conformation, and the metabolic lability of the benzylic position, iodine(I)/iodine(III) catalysis has been leveraged for the stereocontrolled generation of selectively fluorinated analogs. To augment the current arsenal of fluorocyclization reactions involving carboxylic acid derivatives, the reaction of readily accessible 2&#8208;vinyl benzaldehydes is disclosed (up to &gt;95:05  d.r  . and 97:03  e.r.  ). Key stereoelectronic interactions manifest themselves in the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the products, thereby validating the [CH  2  &#8208;CHF] fragment as a stereoelectronic mimic of the [O&#8208;CH(OR)] acetal motif.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Photosensitizer Nanosheets via Low&#8208;Energy Electron Beam Induced Cross&#8208;Linking of Self&#8208;Assembled RuII Polypyridine Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large area &#8776;1&#8197;nm thick molecular photosensitizer nanosheets are synthesized via electron irradiation induced cross&#8208;linking of RuII polypyridine monolayers. Their physical and chemical properties are promising for applications in two&#8208;dimensional photocatalytic systems.







Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis for hydrogen production is an important element in the search for green energy sources. The incorporation of photoactive units into mechanically stable 2D materials paves the way toward the realization of ultrathin membranes as mimics for leaves. Here we present and compare two concepts to introduce a photoactive RuII polypyridine complex into &#8776;1&#8197;nm thick carbon nanomembranes (CNMs) generated by low&#8208;energy electron irradiation induced cross&#8208;linking of aromatic self&#8208;assembled monolayers. The photoactive units are either directly incorporated into the CNM scaffold or covalently grafted to its surface. We characterize RuII CNMs using X&#8208;ray photoelectron, surface&#8208;enhanced Raman, photothermal deflection spectroscopy, atomic force, scanning electron microscopy, and study their photoactivity in graphene field&#8208;effect devices. Therewith, we explore the applicability of low&#8208;energy electron irradiation of metal complexes for photosensitizer nanosheet formation.

A catalyst&#8208;dependent [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of sulfoxide&#8208;ynamides enables the divergent and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of a series of valuable medium&#8208;sized N,S&#8208;heterocycles in moderate to good yields with broad substrate scope. Excellent enantioselectivities were achieved with this chirality&#8208;transfer strategy, which was studied by theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Medium&#8208;sized N,S&#8208;heterocycles have received tremendous interest due to their biological activities and potential medical applications. However, asymmetric synthesis of these compounds are extremely rare. Described herein is a catalyst&#8208;dependent [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of sulfoxide&#8208;ynamides, enabling divergent and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of a series of valuable medium&#8208;sized N,S&#8208;heterocycles in moderate to good yields with broad substrate scope. Importantly, excellent enantioselectivities have been achieved via an unprecedented chirality&#8208;transfer. Moreover, theoretical calculations are employed to elucidate the origins of the catalyst&#8208;dependent stereospecific [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement.

         <title>Anisotropy in a 2D Perovskite Ferroelectric Drives Self&#8208;Powered Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photoresponse for Ultraviolet Solar&#8208;Blind Polarized&#8208;Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;powered ultraviolet solar&#8208;blind polarized&#8208;light detection has been demonstrated for the first time in a new wide band&#8208;gap 2D perovskite&#8208;type ferroelectric, (isobutylammonium)2(methylamium)Pb2Cl7, and closely involves the inherent anisotropy and bulk photovoltaic effect.







Abstract
Polarized&#8208;light detection in the deep ultraviolet solar&#8208;blind region is indispensable for optoelectronic applications. 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics with inherent anisotropy and bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) have become a robust candidate in this portfolio. We here report a wide band&#8208;gap 2D perovskite ferroelectric, (isobutylammonium)2(methylamium)Pb2Cl7 (1), in which the BPVE behaves as self&#8208;driving source for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet polarized&#8208;light detection. It exhibits a large dichroism ratio (&#8776;15.7) and superior BPVE&#8208;directed photocurrent (&#8776;3.6&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, under 266&#8197;nm). These attributes facilitate excellent self&#8208;powered polarized&#8208;light detection of high on/off contrast (&#8776;103) and polarization ratio (&#8776;2.5), beyond those of inorganic oxides (e.g., ZnO, 1.47; GaN, 1.38). This study highlights potential of 2D perovskite ferroelectrics for new optoelectronic application.

         <title>Liquid Na/K Alloy Interfacial Synthesis of Functional Porous Carbon at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous carbons were directly synthesized under ambient temperature via a liquid metal interfacial engineering strategy. Unlike the traditional carbons, these materials are abundant with active sites of C&#8722;Cl bonds. Imidazole and 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane were tandem&#8208;grafted on this porous carbon. Amine and bromide ion showed a synergistic effect to promote the catalytic reaction for cycloaddition of CO2, resulting in excellent catalytic performance.







Abstract
The functional groups in porous carbon generally suffer a severe loss during the high&#8208;temperature carbonization. Instead, the low&#8208;temperature synthesis of carbon featuring porous structures and abundant functional groups is not only a solution that evades the pitfalls of pyrolysis but also is of significance for the development of synthetic methodology. Herein, a liquid metal interfacial engineering strategy is reported for the synthesis of porous carbon using CCl4 as the carbon precursor and sodium&#8208;potassium alloy (NaK) as the reducing agent, which is superior to traditional synthetic methods because it enables the engineering of a highly active liquid metal alloy microemulsion to directly generate porous carbon at ambient temperature. As synthesized porous carbon featured abundant carbon&#8208;chlorine bonds can be tandem&#8208;grafted with imidazole and 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane to achieve a CO2 cycloaddition catalyst, which exhibits excellent catalytic activity, in addition to exceptional stability.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Dual&#8208;Metal Site Catalysts for Enhanced CO2 Reduction: Mechanistic Insight into Active Site Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of atomically dispersed and nitrogen coordinated dual&#8208;metal sites (e.g., Ni&#8208;Fe, Fe&#8208;Co, and Ni&#8208;Co) was designed. Among all possible dual&#8208;metal site configurations, the predicted 2N&#8208;bridged (Fe&#8208;Ni)N6 sites exhibited the highest CO2RR activity and promising stability. The optimal dual&#8208;metal sites can decrease the energy barriers for the *COOH adsorption (&#8722;0.34&#8197;eV) and the *CO desorption (0.39&#8197;eV), facilitating CO2 reduction to CO.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;supported nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;metal site catalysts (i.e., M&#8722;N&#8722;C, M: Fe, Co, or Ni) are active for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO. Further improving their intrinsic activity and selectivity by tuning their N&#8722;M bond structures and coordination is limited. Herein, we expand the coordination environments of M&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts by designing dual&#8208;metal active sites. The Ni&#8208;Fe catalyst exhibited the most efficient CO2RR activity and promising stability compared to other combinations. Advanced structural characterization and theoretical prediction suggest that the most active N&#8208;coordinated dual&#8208;metal site configurations are 2N&#8208;bridged (Fe&#8208;Ni)N6, in which FeN4 and NiN4 moieties are shared with two N atoms. Two metals (i.e., Fe and Ni) in the dual&#8208;metal site likely generate a synergy to enable more optimal *COOH adsorption and *CO desorption than single&#8208;metal sites (FeN4 or NiN4) with improved intrinsic catalytic activity and selectivity.

         <dc:description>
Fluorophore&#8208;free single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) and Janus derivatives were synthesized on large scale by electrostatic&#8208;mediated intramolecular crosslinking, providing a powerful tool to selectively illuminate interfaces.







Abstract
We report the large&#8208;scale synthesis of photoluminescent single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) by electrostatic&#8208;mediated intramolecular crosslinking in a concentrated solution of 40&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 by continuous addition of the free radical initiator. Poly(vinyl benzyl chloride) was charged by quaternization with vinyl&#8208;imidazolium for the intramolecular crosslinking by using 2,2&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenylacetophenone (DMAP) as the radical initiator. Under the electrostatic repulsion thus interchain isolation, the intrachain crosslinking experiences the transition from coil through pearl&#8208;necklace to globular state. The SCNPs demonstrate strong photoluminescence in the visible range when the non&#8208;emissive units are confined thereby. Composition and microstructure of the SCNPs are tunable. The photoluminescent tadpole&#8208;like Janus SCNP can be used to selectively illuminate interfacial membranes while stabilizing the emulsions.

         <title>A Novel Catalytic Route to Polymerizable Bicyclic Cyclic Carbonate Monomers from Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalytic approach for the preparation of polymerizable bicyclic carbonates allows the synthesis of a wide range of unique heterocycles. The stereochemical configuration of the epoxy alcohol substrate plays a crucial role, determining the chemoselectivity profile of this coupling manifold. The synthetic potential of these bicyclic six&#8208;membered carbonates was examined, and their successful ring&#8208;opening polymerization under mild conditions gives new incentives for relatively rigid polycarbonate architectures.







Abstract
A new catalytic route has been developed for the coupling of epoxides and CO2 affording polymerizable six&#8208;membered bicyclic carbonates. Cyclic epoxides equipped with a &#946;&#8208;positioned OH group can be transformed into structurally diverse bicyclic cyclic carbonates in good yields and with high selectivity. Key to the chemo&#8208;selectivity is the difference between the reactivity of syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;configured epoxy alcohols, with the latter leading to six&#8208;membered ring carbonate formation in the presence of a binary AlIII aminotriphenolate complex/DIPEA catalyst. X&#8208;ray analyses show that the conversion of the syn&#8208;configured substrate evolves via a standard double inversion pathway providing a five&#8208;membered carbonate product, whereas the anti&#8208;isomer allows for activation of the oxirane unit of the substrate opposite to the pendent alcohol. The potential use of these bicyclic products is shown in ring&#8208;opening polymerization offering access to rigid polycarbonates with improved thermal resistance.

&lt;p&gt;A new catalytic route has been developed for the coupling of epoxides and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affording polymerizable six-membered bicyclic carbonates. Cyclic epoxides equipped with a &#946;-positioned OH group can be transformed into structurally diverse bicyclic cyclic carbonates in good yields and with high selectivity. Key to the chemo-selectivity is the difference between the reactivity of &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-configured epoxy alcohols, with the latter leading to six-membered ring carbonate formation in the presence of a binary Al&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; aminotriphenolate complex/DIPEA catalyst. X-ray analyses show that the conversion of the &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-configured substrate evolves via a standard double inversion pathway providing a five-membered carbonate product, whereas the &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-isomer allows for activation of the oxirane unit of the substrate opposite to the pendent alcohol. The potential use of these bicyclic products is shown in ring-opening polymerization offering access to rigid polycarbonates with improved thermal resistance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decorating Bacteria with Triple Immune Nanoactivators Generates Tumor&#8208;Resident Living Immunotherapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decorating bacteria with triple immune nanoactivators via in situ dopamine polymerization is reported to develop tumor&#8208;resident living immunotherapeutics. Decorated bacteria show a spatiotemporal tumor retention and a proliferation&#8208;dependent drug release, achieving potent antitumor effects in two antigen&#8208;overexpressing tumor models. This work provides a versatile platform to prepare multimodal long&#8208;acting therapeutics for tumor immunotherapy.







Abstract
An approach of decorating bacteria with triple immune nanoactivators is reported to develop tumor&#8208;resident living immunotherapeutics. Under cytocompatible conditions, tumor&#8208;specific antigens and checkpoint blocking antibodies are simultaneously conjugated onto bacterial surface and then polydopamine nanoparticles are formed via in situ dopamine polymerization. In addition to serving as a linker, polydopamine with its photothermal effect can repolarize tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to a pro&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. The linked antigens promote the maturation of dendritic cells and generate tumor&#8208;specific immune responses, while the anchored antibodies block immune checkpoints and activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Decorated bacteria show spatiotemporal tumor retention and proliferation&#8208;dependent drug release, achieving potent antitumor effects in two antigen&#8208;overexpressing tumor models. This work provides a versatile platform to prepare multimodal and long&#8208;acting therapeutics for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>syn&#8208;Selective Epoxidation of Chiral Terminal Allylic Alcohols with a Titanium Salalen Catalyst and Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation/kinetic resolution provides access to anti&#8208;configurated terminal epoxy alcohols with high selectivity, no analogous syn&#8208;selective epoxidation process has been available. We report that this &#8220;missing link&#8221; is provided by a readily available titanium salalen catalyst. Besides allylic alcohols, allylic ethers are epoxidized with extreme syn&#8208;selectivity, at low catalyst loading, with aqueous H2O2 as oxidant.







Abstract
In the Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation of chiral secondary allylic alcohols, one substrate enantiomer is predominantly converted to the anti&#8208;epoxy alcohol. We herein report the first highly syn&#8208;selective epoxidation of terminal allylic alcohols using a titanium salalen complex as catalyst, at room temperature, and aqueous hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. With enantiopure terminal allylic alcohols as substrates, the epoxy alcohols were obtained with up to 98&#8201;% yield and up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr (syn). Catalyst loadings as low as 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% can be applied without eroding the syn&#8208;diastereoselectivity. Modification of the allylic alcohol to an ether does not affect the diastereoselectivity either [&gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr (syn)]. Inverting the catalyst configuration leads to the anti&#8208;product, albeit at lower dr (ca. 20&#8201;:&#8201;1). The synthetic potential is demonstrated by a short, gram&#8208;scale preparation of a tetrahydrofuran building block with three stereocenters, involving two titanium salalen catalyzed epoxidation steps.

         <title>A Well&#8208;Defined Anionic Dicopper(I) Monohydride Complex that Reacts like a Cluster**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare, well&#8208;defined dicopper hydride (Cu2H) complex is reported, that displays divergent reactivity from known Cu2Hs. Using a combined experimental and computational approach, we ascribe the cluster&#8208;like reactivity to the rigid dinucleating nature of the expanded pincer ligand, which prevents the formation of mononuclear CuHs in solution.







Abstract
Low&#8208;nuclearity copper hydrides are rare and few well&#8208;defined dicopper hydrides have been reported. Herein, we describe the first example of a structurally characterized anionic dicopper hydride complex. This complex does not display typical reactivity associated with low&#8208;nuclearity copper hydrides, such as alcoholysis or insertion reactions. Instead, its stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity is akin to that of copper hydride clusters. The distinct reactivity is ascribed to the robust dinuclear core that is bound tightly within the dinucleating ligand scaffold.

         <title>In Operando Identification of In Situ Formed Metalloid Zinc&#948;+ Active Sites for Highly Efficient Electrocatalyzed Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a zinc&#8208;based electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction reaction, the Zn&#948;+ metalloid hollow sites of stable, nonstoichiometric ZnOx, derived from Zn2P2O7, were shown to be the real active site structures for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, demonstrated by structure characterizations through operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis in conjunction with evolutionary&#8208;algorithm&#8208;based global optimization.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion provides a possible way to address problems associated with the greenhouse effect; however, developing low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts to mediate high&#8208;efficiency CO2 reduction remains a challenge on account of the limited understanding of the nature of the real active sites. Herein, we reveal the Zn&#948;+ metalloid sites as the real active sites of stable nonstoichiometric ZnOx structure derived from Zn2P2O7 through operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis in conjunction with evolutionary&#8208;algorithm&#8208;based global optimization. Furthermore, theoretical and experimental results demonstrated that Zn&#948;+ metalloid active sites could facilitate the activation of CO2 and the hydrogenation of *CO2, thus accelerating the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. Our work establishes a critical fundamental understanding of the origin of the real active center in the zinc&#8208;based electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction.

         <title>Deciphering Chemical Mediators Regulating Specialized Metabolism in a Symbiotic Cyanobacterium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nostovalerolactones are a novel class of cyanobacterial natural products that are derived from a tetronate&#8208;like biosynthesis pathway and team up with nostoclides to orchestrate the specialized metabolism in a symbiotic cyanobacterium. The data show how an understanding of regulation can be used to achieve high&#8208;titer production of bioactive specialized metabolites in cyanobacteria.







Abstract
Genomes of cyanobacteria feature a variety of cryptic biosynthetic pathways for complex natural products, but the peculiarities limiting the discovery and exploitation of the metabolic dark matter are not well understood. Here we describe the discovery of two cell density&#8208;dependent chemical mediators, nostoclide and nostovalerolactone, in the symbiotic model strain Nostoc punctiforme, and demonstrate their pronounced impact on the regulation of specialized metabolism. Through transcriptional, bioinformatic and labeling studies we assigned two adjacent biosynthetic gene clusters to the biosynthesis of the two polyketide mediators. Our findings provide insight into the orchestration of specialized metabolite production and give lessons for the genomic mining and high&#8208;titer production of cyanobacterial bioactive compounds.

     alt="Deciphering Chemical Mediators Regulating Specialized Metabolism in a Symbiotic Cyanobacterium"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nostovalerolactones are a novel class of cyanobacterial natural products that are derived from a tetronate-like biosynthesis pathway and team up with nostoclides to orchestrate the specialized metabolism in a symbiotic cyanobacterium. The data show how an understanding of regulation can be used to achieve high-titer production of bioactive specialized metabolites in cyanobacteria.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genomes of cyanobacteria feature a variety of cryptic biosynthetic pathways for complex natural products, but the peculiarities limiting the discovery and exploitation of the metabolic dark matter are not well understood. Here we describe the discovery of two cell density-dependent chemical mediators, nostoclide and nostovalerolactone, in the symbiotic model strain &lt;i&gt;Nostoc punctiforme&lt;/i&gt;, and demonstrate their pronounced impact on the regulation of specialized metabolism. Through transcriptional, bioinformatic and labeling studies we assigned two adjacent biosynthetic gene clusters to the biosynthesis of the two polyketide mediators. Our findings provide insight into the orchestration of specialized metabolite production and give lessons for the genomic mining and high-titer production of cyanobacterial bioactive compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystalline Porphyrazine&#8208;Linked Fused Aromatic Networks with High Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new fused aromatic network has a highly stable and crystalline structure (denoted as Pz&#8208;FAN) in which pyrazine&#8208;based building blocks are used to form porphyrazine (Pz) linkages via an irreversible reaction with physicochemical stability. The newly prepared Pz&#8208;FAN displayed a high magnitude (1.16&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) of proton conductivity, and maximum power and current densities of 192&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 481&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively.







Abstract
Fused aromatic networks (FANs) have been studied in efforts to overcome the low physicochemical stability of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), while preserving crystallinity. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a highly stable and crystalline FAN (denoted as Pz&#8208;FAN) using pyrazine&#8208;based building blocks to form porphyrazine (Pz) linkages via an irreversible reaction. Unlike most COFs and FANs, which are synthesized from two different building blocks, the new Pz&#8208;FAN is formed using a single building block by self&#8208;cyclotetramerization. Controlled and optimized reaction conditions result in a highly crystalline Pz&#8208;FAN with physicochemical stability. The newly prepared Pz&#8208;FAN displayed a high magnitude (1.16&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) of proton conductivity compared to other reported FANs and polymers. Finally, the Pz&#8208;FAN&#8208;based membrane was evaluated for a proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), which showed maximum power and current densities of 192&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 481&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively.

         <title>Concise and Stereodivergent Approach to Chromanone Lactones through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Vinylogous Addition of Siloxyfurans to 2&#8208;Ester&#8208;Substituted Chromones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric vinylogous addition of siloxyfurans to 2&#8208;ester&#8208;substituted chromones is described. This method generated enantioenriched chromanone lactones with divergent diastereoselectivities depending on the ligand used and enabled a concise and enantioselective synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;blennolide&#8197;B with excellent stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Vicinal oxygen&#8208;containing tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted stereocenters exist widely in chromanone lactone and tetrahydroxanthone natural products. Their enantioselective construction in a single step remains elusive and poses a formidable challenge for chemical synthesis. Here, we report the first copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric vinylogous additions of siloxyfurans to 2&#8208;ester&#8208;substituted chromones, which enable concise and enantioselective assembly of chromanone lactones. Both syn and anti adducts can be accessed with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity by judicious choice of the chiral ligands. Our approach allowed for the efficient synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;blennolide&#8197;B with precise stereochemical control, which provides a formal synthesis of secalonic acid&#8197;A.

         <title>A Simple Fluorescence Affinity Assay to Decipher Uranyl&#8208;Binding to Native Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent uranyl probe was designed and validated for the reliable determination of uranyl&#8211;protein affinities, at equilibrium and in biologically relevant conditions.







Abstract
Determining the affinity of proteins for uranyl is key to understand the toxicity of this cation and to further develop decorporation strategies. However, usual techniques to achieve that goal often require specific equipment and expertise. Here, we propose a simple, efficient, fluorescence&#8208;based method to assess the affinity of proteins and peptides for uranyl, at equilibrium and in buffered solution. We first designed and characterized an original uranyl&#8208;binding fluorescent probe. We then built a reference scale for uranyl affinity in solution, relying on signal quenching of our fluorescent probe in presence of high&#8208;affinity uranyl&#8208;binding peptides. We finally validated our approach by re&#8208;evaluating the uranyl&#8208;binding affinity of four native proteins. We envision that this tool will facilitate the reliable and reproducible assessment of affinities of peptides and proteins for uranyl.

         <title>Single Stabilizing Point Mutation Enables High&#8208;Resolution Co&#8208;Crystal Structures of the Adenosine A2A Receptor with Preladenant Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The adenosine A2A receptor (A2AAR), which is activated by the extracellular nucleoside adenosine, belongs to the family of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). A2AAR antagonists are beneficial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and have shown potential as novel checkpoint inhibitors in cancer immunotherapy. The illustration shows a new A2AAR crystal in complex with a fluorescence&#8208;labeled antagonist integrated into the cell membrane. Details of the study are reported by Christa&#8197;E. M&#252;ller et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202115545).

         <title>Anion Reinforced Solvation for Gradient Inorganic&#8208;Rich Interphase Enables High&#8208;Rate and Stable Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallic Na is a promising anode for rechargeable batteries, however, it is plagued by unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and Na dendrites. Herein, a robust anion&#8208;derived SEI is constructed on Na anode in high&#8208;concentration 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) based electrolyte with a cosolvent hydrofluoroether, which effectively restrain Na dendrite growth. The hydrofluoroether can tune the solvation configuration of the electrolyte from three&#8208;dimensional network aggregates to solvent&#8208;cation&#8208;anion clusters, enabling more anions to enter and reinforce the inner solvation sheath and their step&#8208;wise decomposition. The gradient inorganic&#8208;rich SEI leads to reduced energy barrier of Na+  migration and enhanced interfacial kinetics. These render the Na||Na3V2(PO4)3  battery with excellent rate capability of 79.9 mAh g&#8208;1  at 24C and high capacity retention of 94.2% after 6000 cycles at 1C. This highlights modulation of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase chemistry for advanced batteries.</dc:description>

This highlights modulation of the electrode-electrolyte interphase chemistry for advanced batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Biodegradable Iridium(III) Coordination Polymer for Enhanced Two&#8208;Photon Photodynamic Therapy Using an Apoptosis&#8208;Ferroptosis Hybrid Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clinical application of photodynamic therapy is hindered by the high glutathione concentration, poor cancer&#8208;targeting properties, poor drug loading into delivery systems, and an inefficient activation of the cell death machinery in cancer cells. To overcome these limitations, herein, the formulation of a promising Ir(III) complex into a biodegradable coordination polymer (  IrS NPs  ) is presented. The nanoparticles were found to remain stable under physiological conditions but deplete glutathione and disintegrate into the monomeric metal complexes in the tumor microenvironment, causing an enhanced therapeutic effect. The nanoparticles were found to selectively accumulate in the mitochondria where these trigger cell death by hybrid apoptosis and ferroptosis pathways through the photoinduced production of singlet oxygen and superoxide anion radicals. This study presents the first example of a coordination polymer that can efficiently cause cancer cell death by apoptosis and ferroptosis upon irradiation, providing an innovative approach for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Organic Cathodes for Zinc Ion Batteries through Electron Cloud and Solvation Structure Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox&#8208;active organic materials, as a new generation of sustainable resources, are receiving increasing attention in zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) due to their resource abundance and structure tunable. However, organic molecules with high potential are rare, and the voltage of most reported organic cathode&#8208;based ZIBs is less than 1.2 V. Herein, we explored the redox process of p&#8208;type organics and figured out the relationship between energy change and voltage output during the process. Then, we proposed a dual&#8208;step strategy to effectively tune the energy change and eventually improve the output voltage of the organic electrode. Combining the regulation on electron cloud of organic molecules and manipulation of the solvation structure, the output voltage of an organosulfur compound based ZIB was greatly increased from 0.8 V to 1.7 V. Our results put forward a specific pathway to improve the working voltage and lay the foundation for the practical application of organic electrodes.</dc:description>

Abstract
During the global crisis triggered by the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, university programs, meetings, and conferences have moved to virtual settings, with consequent erosion of mentorship opportunities for students and early&#8208;career professionals. This calls for mentorship platforms that are adapted to the new landscape in order to bring about a positive change. Our Viewpoint Article shares the perspective of the Transformative Education program and Mentorship Talks initiative at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon, with the aim of providing insights that could stimulate other mentorship platforms.

         <title>Efficient Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Sensitized by a Chromium(III) Complex via an Underexplored Energy Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular ruby [Cr(bpmp)2]3+ with an earth&#8208;abundant chromium(III) central ion sensitizes green&#8208;to&#8208;blue triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion with 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene as the annihilator. The process involves a near&#8208;unity energy transfer efficiency via an underexplored reaction pathway, an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 0.54&#8197;eV, and a maximum upconversion quantum yield of 12.0&#8201;%.







Abstract
Sensitized triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (sTTA&#8208;UC) mainly relies on precious metal complexes thanks to their high intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiencies, excited state energies, and lifetimes, while complexes of abundant first&#8208;row transition metals are only rarely utilized and with often moderate UC quantum yields. [Cr(bpmp)2]3+ (bpmp=2,6&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)pyridine) containing earth&#8208;abundant chromium possesses an absorption band suitable for green light excitation, a doublet excited state energy matching the triplet energy of 9,10&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), a close to millisecond excited state lifetime, and high photostability. Combined ISC and doublet&#8208;triplet energy transfer from excited [Cr(bpmp)2]3+ to DPA gives 3DPA with close&#8208;to&#8208;unity quantum yield. TTA of 3DPA furnishes green&#8208;to&#8208;blue UC with a quantum yield of 12.0&#8201;% (close to the theoretical maximum). Sterically less&#8208;hindered anthracenes undergo a [4+4] cycloaddition with [Cr(bpmp)2]3+ and green light.

         <title>Engineering Highly Reduced Molybdenum Polyoxometalates via the Incorporation of d and f Block Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel types of highly reduced Mo polyoxometalates, the {Mo64} cube and {Mo70} star, are obtained through near&#8208;hydrothermal conditions with incorporations of nickel and lanthanide ions and possess a set of building blocks different to those present in Mo blues and browns. With a few of other rare structures, this group of polyoxomolybdates is redefined as Mo reds based on the major differences in building blocks and reduction degrees.







Abstract
The assembly of nanoscale polyoxometalate (POM) clusters has been dominated by the highly reduced icosahedral {Mo132} &#8220;browns&#8221; and the toroidal {Mo154} &#8220;blues&#8221; which are 45&#8201;% and 18&#8201;% reduced, respectively. We hypothesised that there is space for a greater diversity of structures in this immediate reduction zone. Here we show it is possible to make highly reduced mix&#8208;valence POMs by presenting new classes of polyoxomolybdates: [MoV52MoVI12H26O200]42&#8722; {Mo64} and [MoV40MoVI30H30O215]20&#8722; {Mo70}, 81&#8201;% and 57&#8201;% reduced, respectively. The {Mo64} cluster archetype has a super&#8208;cube structure and is composed of five different types of building blocks, each arranged in overlayed Archimedean or Platonic polyhedra. The {Mo70} cluster comprises five tripodal {MoV6} and five tetrahedral {MoV2MoVI2} building blocks alternatively linked to form a loop with a pentagonal star topology. We also show how the reaction yielding the {Mo64} super&#8208;cube can be used in the enrichment of lanthanides which exploit the differences in selectivity in the self&#8208;assembly of the polyoxometalates.

         <title>More than a Leaving Group: N&#8208;Phenyltrifluoroacetimidate as a Remote Directing Group for Highly &#945;&#8208;Selective 1,2&#8208;cis Glycosylation</title>

         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidoyl group at O6 was found to be highly stereodirecting for the challenging 1,2&#8208;cis &#945;&#8208;glycosylation. Its remote participation is supported by characterization of the crucial 1,6&#8208;bridged bicyclic cation intermediates as well as other experimental evidence.







Abstract
The anomeric configuration can greatly affect the biological functions and activities of carbohydrates. Herein, we report that N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidoyl (PTFAI), a well&#8208;known leaving group for catalytic glycosylation, can act as a stereodirecting group for the challenging 1,2&#8208;cis &#945;&#8208;glycosylation. Utilizing rapidly accessible 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;OPTFAI glycosyl donors, TMSOTf&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation occurred with excellent &#945;&#8208;selectivity and broad substrate scope, and the remaining 6&#8208;OPTFAI group can be cleaved chemoselectively. The remote participation of 6&#8208;OPTFAI is supported by the first characterization of the crucial 1,6&#8208;bridged bicyclic oxazepinium ion intermediates by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy. These cations were found to be relatively stable and mainly responsible for the present stereoselectivities. Further application is highlighted in glycosylation reactions toward trisaccharide heparins as well as the convergent synthesis of chacotriose derivatives using a bulky 2,4&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated donor.

         <title>Click Synthesis Enabled Sulfur Atom Strategy for Polymerization&#8208;Enhanced and Two&#8208;Photon Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208;free thiol&#8211;yne click reaction facilely afforded photosensitizers by using the in situ formed sulfur &#8220;heavy atom effect&#8221; to enhance the intersystem crossing. Combined with aggregation&#8208;induced emission and polymerization effects, excellent photosensitizers can be obtained for two&#8208;photon excited photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Facile tailoring of photosensitizers (PSs) with advanced and synergetic properties is highly expected to broaden and deepen photodynamic therapy (PDT) applications. Herein, a catalyst&#8208;free thiol&#8211;yne click reaction was employed to develop the sulfur atom&#8208;based PSs by using the in situ formed sulfur &#8220;heavy atom effect&#8221; to enhance the intersystem crossing (ISC), while such an effect can be remarkably magnified by the polymerization. The introduction of a tetraphenylpyrazine&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) unit was also advantageous in PS design by suppressing their non&#8208;radiative decay to facilitate the ISC in the aggregated state. Besides, the resulting sulfur atom electron donor, together with a double&#8208;bond &#960; bridge and AIE electron acceptor, created a donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) molecular system with good two&#8208;photon excitation properties. Combined with the high singlet oxygen generation efficiency, the fabricated polymer nanoparticles exhibited an excellent in vitro two&#8208;photon&#8208;excited PDT towards cancer cells, therefore possessing a huge potential for the deep&#8208;tissue disease therapy.

A pyrene&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;Ni carbon&#8208;nanotube anchor affords million&#8208;turnover stability for an electroenzymatic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction reaction by a recombinant carbon monoxide dehydrogenase.







Abstract
An original 1&#8208;acetato&#8208;4&#8208;(1&#8208;pyrenyl)&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (AcPyTACN) was synthesized for the immobilization of a His&#8208;tagged recombinant CODH from Rhodospirillum rubrum (RrCODH) on carbon&#8208;nanotube electrodes. The strong binding of the enzyme at the Ni&#8208;AcPyTACN complex affords a high current density of 4.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 towards electroenzymatic CO2 reduction and a high stability of more than 6&#215;106&#8197;TON when integrated on a gas&#8208;diffusion bioelectrode.

         <title>Trapping&#8208;Enrichment Multi&#8208;dimensional Liquid Chromatography with On&#8208;Line Deuterated Solvent Exchange for Streamlined Structure Elucidation at the Microgram Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trapping&#8208;Enrichment Deuterated Multidimensional&#8208;Liquid Chromatography (TE&#8208;Dt&#8208;mDLC) for rapid microgram&#8208;scale structure elucidation by NMR is introduced. This concept enables a streamlined chemical characterization of multicomponent mixtures (e.g. catalysis, natural products) while bypassing tedious drying processes with recoveries above 90&#8201;% using as little as a few micrograms of material.







Abstract
At the forefront of chemistry and biology research, development timelines are fast&#8208;paced and large quantities of pure targets are rarely available. Herein, we introduce a new framework, which is built upon an automated, online trapping&#8208;enrichment multi&#8208;dimensional liquid chromatography platform (TE&#8208;Dt&#8208;mDLC) that enables: 1)&#8197;highly efficient separation of complex mixtures in a first dimension (1D&#8208;UV); 2)&#8197;automated peak trapping&#8208;enrichment and buffer removal achieved through a sequence of H2O and D2O washes using an independent pump setup; and 3)&#8197;a second dimension separation (2D&#8208;UV&#8208;MS) with fully deuterated mobile phases and fraction collection to minimize protic residues for immediate NMR analysis while bypassing tedious drying processes and minimizing analyte degradation. Diverse examples of target isolation and characterization from organic synthesis and natural product chemistry laboratories are illustrated, demonstrating recoveries above 90&#8201;% using as little as a few micrograms of material.

         <title>Atom Swapping on Aromatic Rings: Conversion from Phosphinine Pincer Metal Complexes to Metallabenzenes Triggered by O2 Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthetic method for metallabenzene was developed in which a phosphorus atom in a phosphinine ring is swapped with transition metal fragments. The oxidation of a phosphinine pincer iridium complex by O2 afforded iridabenzene via exchange of the phosphorus atom and the iridium fragment. Dianionic rhodabenzene was synthesized by O2 oxidation of an analogous rhodium complex, followed by reduction by metallic potassium.







Abstract
Herein, we report a novel method for the synthesis of metallabenzenes by swapping the phosphorus atom in an aromatic phosphinine ring with transition metal fragments. The oxidation of a phosphine&#8208;phosphinine&#8208;phosphine pincer iridium complex by O2 triggered the replacement of the phosphorus atom of the phosphinine ring by an iridium fragment to afford iridabenzene. Dianionic rhodabenzene was also synthesized from a phosphinine rhodium complex by oxidation of the phosphorus atom, followed by subsequent reduction using metallic potassium. The aromaticity of the newly synthesized irida&#8208; and rhoda&#8208;benzenes was evaluated both experimentally and theoretically.

&lt;p&gt;A novel synthetic method for metallabenzene was developed in which a phosphorus atom in a phosphinine ring is swapped with transition metal fragments. The oxidation of a phosphinine pincer iridium complex by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; afforded iridabenzene via exchange of the phosphorus atom and the iridium fragment. Dianionic rhodabenzene was synthesized by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; oxidation of an analogous rhodium complex, followed by reduction by metallic potassium.

         <title>Acridine&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) as Photocatalysts for Metallaphotocatalytic C&#8722;N Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of porous crystalline COFs bearing acridine moieties was synthesized and applied as photocatalysts in metallaphotocatalytic C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling. Among these materials the fully &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COF showed the highest catalytic activity and was shown to be recyclable and even catalyzed the cross&#8208;coupling efficiently under green light irradiation.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are structurally tuneable, porous and crystalline polymers constructed through the covalent attachment of small organic building blocks as elementary units. Using the myriad of such building blocks, a broad spectrum of functionalities has been applied for COF syntheses for broad applications, including heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we report the synthesis of a new family of porous and crystalline COFs using a novel acridine linker and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarbaldehyde derivatives bearing a variable number of hydroxy groups. With the broad absorption in the visible light region, the COFs were applied as photocatalysts in metallaphotocatalytic C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling. The fully &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine linked COF showed the highest activity, due to the increased charge separation upon irradiation. The COF showed good to excellent yields for several aryl bromides, good recyclability and even catalyzed the organic transformation in presence of green light as energy source.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Molecular Trefoil Knots Featuring Pentadecanuclear Homoleptic AuI&#8208;, AuI/AgI&#8208;, or AuI/CuI&#8208;Alkynyl Coordination</title>

         <dc:description>
Au15 molecular trefoil knots, based on AuI&#8208;alkynyl coordination and featuring AuI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AuI interactions, self&#8208;assemble without requiring bi&#8208; or multidentate/multipodal ligands. These trefoil knots with unprecedentedly high metal nuclearity per trefoil knot strand react with CuI/AgI species to give Au9M6 (M=Cu/Ag) trefoil knots. The solid&#8208;state structures, solution behavior, and photoluminescence properties of the trefoil knots were investigated.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free and metal&#8208;containing molecular trefoil knots are fascinating ensembles that are usually covalently assembled, the latter requiring the rational design of di&#8208; or multidentate/multipodal ligands as connectors. In this work, we describe the self&#8208;assembly of pentadecanuclear AuI trefoil knots [Au15(C&#8801;CR)15] from monoalkynes HC&#8801;CR (R=9,9&#8208;X2&#8208;fluorenyl with X=nBu, n&#8208;hexyl) and [AuI(THT)Cl]. Hetero&#8208;bimetallic counterparts [Au9M6(C&#8801;CR)15] (M=Cu/Ag) were self&#8208;assembled by reactions of [Au15(C&#8801;CR)15] with [Cu(MeCN)4]+/AgNO3 and HC&#8801;CR. The type of pentadecanuclear trefoil knots described herein is characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, 2D NMR and HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS. [Au9Cu6(C&#8801;CR)15] is relatively stable in hexane; its excited state properties were investigated. DFT calculations revealed that non&#8208;covalent metal&#8211;metal and metal&#8211;ligand interactions, together with longer alkyl chain&#8208;strengthened inter&#8208;ligand dispersion interactions, govern the stability of the trefoil knot structures.

         <title>Chemoselective and Diastereoselective Intramolecular (3+2) Cycloadditions of Epoxy and Aziridinyl Enolsilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epoxy and aziridinyl enolsilanes react as oxyallylic cation equivalents in diastereoselective intramolecular stepwise (3+2) cycloadditions with acyclic dienes, outcompeting the (4+3) cycloaddition pathway almost exclusively. Computations reveal the factors behind this preference. Optically&#8208;enriched trans&#8208;hydrindanone cycloadducts can be generated.







Abstract
Epoxy and aziridinyl enolsilanes react as oxyallylic cation equivalents in highly chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective intramolecular (3+2) cycloadditions with a range of dienes and olefins. With acyclic dienes, the (3+2) cycloaddition outcompetes the (4+3) pathway traditionally observed in this kind of system almost exclusively. With both conjugated dienes and isolated olefins, excellent diastereoselectivities are observed, and cycloadducts can be obtained in optically&#8208;enriched forms. Computational studies indicate that the stepwise (3+2) cycloaddition involves an activated epoxy/aziridinyl intermediate and the conformational flexibility of the intermediate determines the preference for (3+2) cycloadduct formation. Further transformations of the (3+2) cycloadducts produce densely functionalized trans&#8208;hydrindane scaffolds.

         <title>Micromechanically&#8208;Powered Rolling Locomotion of a Twisted&#8208;Crystal Optical&#8208;Waveguide Cavity as a Mobile Light Polarization Rotor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted organic crystals display rolling locomotion on a flat substrate when subjected to mechanical force using an atomic force microscope cantilever tip. These crystals are flexible and efficiently self&#8208;guide the fluorescence both in straight and bent geometries and act as optical cavities. Remarkably, twisted&#8208;crystal waveguides rotate the guided polarized optical modes direction as a function of the crystal's rolling motion.







Abstract
We demonstrate mechanically&#8208;powered rolling locomotion of a twisted&#8208;microcrystal optical&#8208;waveguide cavity on the substrate, rotating the output signal's linear&#8208;polarization. Self&#8208;assembly of (E)&#8208;2&#8208;bromo&#8208;6&#8208;(((4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)imino)methyl)&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenol produces naturally twisted microcrystals. The strain between several intergrowing, orientationally mismatched nanocrystalline fibres dictates the pitch lengths of the twisted crystals. The crystals are flexible, perpendicular to twisted (001) and (010) planes due to &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br, N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. The twisted crystals in their straight and bent geometries guide fluorescence along their body axes and display optical modes. Depending upon the degree of mechanical rolling locomotion, the crystal&#8208;waveguide cavity correspondingly rotates the output signal polarization. The presented twisted&#8208;crystal cavity with a combination of mechanical locomotion and photonic attributes unfolds a new dimension in mechanophotonics.

The crystals are flexible, perpendicular to twisted (001) and (010) planes due to &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br, N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. The twisted crystals in their straight and bent geometries guide fluorescence along their body axes and display optical modes. Depending upon the degree of mechanical rolling locomotion, the crystal-waveguide cavity correspondingly rotates the output signal polarization. The presented twisted-crystal cavity with a combination of mechanical locomotion and photonic attributes unfolds a new dimension in mechanophotonics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Widely Distributed Bifunctional Bacterial Cytochrome P450 Enzymes Catalyze both Intramolecular C&#8722;C Bond Formation in cyclo&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr and Its Coupling with Nucleobases</title>

Bioinformatic analysis unveiled a widely distributed two&#8208;gene locus (gym) in actinobacteria. Reconstruction of the biosynthetic pathways and biochemical investigation led to the characterization of the cytochrome P450s GymBs as dual&#8208;functional oxidases, which catalyze both intra&#8208; and intermolecular coupling reactions at different positions of cyclo&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr to generate novel tyrosine&#8208;based alkaloids.







Abstract
Tailoring enzymes are important modification biocatalysts in natural product biosynthesis. We report herein six orthologous two&#8208;gene clusters for mycocyclosin and guatyromycine biosynthesis. Expression of the cyclodipeptide synthase genes gymA1&#8211;gymA6 in Escherichia coli resulted in the formation of cyclo&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr as the major product. Reconstruction of the biosynthetic pathways in Streptomyces albus and biochemical investigation proved that the cytochrome P450 enzymes GymB1&#8211;GymB6 act as both intramolecular oxidases and intermolecular nucleobase transferases. They catalyze not only the oxidative C&#8722;C coupling within cyclo&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr, leading to mycocyclosin, but also its connection with guanine and hypoxanthine, and are thus responsible for the formation of tyrosine&#8208;containing guatyromycines, instead of the reported tryptophan&#8208;nucleobase adducts. Phylogenetic data suggest the presence of at least 47 GymB orthologues, indicating the occurrence of a widely distributed enzyme class.

         <title>PO43&#8722; Coordinated Robust Single&#8208;Atom Platinum Catalyst for Selective Polyol Oxidation**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom Pt1/hydroxyapatite (HAP) catalyst is successfully synthesized by a simple and green hydrothermal strategy. Benefiting from the strong PO43&#8722;&#8208;coordination effect, Pt1/HAP exhibits outstanding catalytic selectivity and catalyst stability without Pt leaching for the selective oxidation of C2&#8211;C4 polyols to corresponding primary hydroxy acids over long periods of operation (&gt;160&#8197;h).







Abstract
Achieving efficient catalytic conversion over a heterogeneous catalyst with excellent resistance against leaching is still a grand challenge for sustainable chemical synthesis in aqueous solution. Herein, we devised a single&#8208;atom Pt1/hydroxyapatite (HAP) catalyst via a simple hydrothermal strategy. Gratifyingly, this robust Pt1/HAP catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic selectivity and catalyst stability for the selective oxidation of C2&#8211;C4 polyols to corresponding primary hydroxy acids. It is found that the Pt&#8722;(O&#8722;P) linkages with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing function of PO43&#8722; (Pt1&#8722;OPO43&#8722; pair active site) not only realize the activation of the C&#8722;H bond, but also destabilize the transition state from adsorbed hydroxy acids toward the C&#8722;C cleavage, resulting in the sharply increased selectivity of hydroxy acids. Moreover, the strong PO43&#8722;&#8208;coordination effect provides electrostatic stabilization for single&#8208;atom Pt, ensuring the highly efficient catalysis of Pt1/HAP for over 160&#8197;hours with superior leaching resistance.

         <title>Perylene&#8208;Based Linear Nonalternant Nanoribbons with Bright Emission and Ambipolar Redox Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly soluble linear non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbons (NNR&#8208;1 to NNR&#8208;4) featuring pentagonal rings peri&#8208;fused onto repeating perylene units have been synthesized by a stepwise approach. The NNRs adopt a twisted nanoribbon structure and exhibit large molar extinction coefficients (up to 400860&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1), high absolute quantum efficiencies (up to 82&#8201;%), and narrowed energy gaps (down to &#8776;1.7&#8197;eV) as well as excellent redox properties.







Abstract
Here we report stepwise solution&#8208;synthesis of linear nonalternant nanoribbons (NNRs), featuring pentagonal rings peri&#8208;fused onto the repeating perylene unit. The X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structures demonstrated their &#960;&#8208;backbones as a twisted ribbon, with the longest crystalline length of the nanoribbon up to 3.9&#8197;nm. NNRs exhibited an orange to deep&#8208;red photoluminescence even under the room light, with absolute &#934;F up to 82&#8201;%, most likely due to ring&#8208;strain induced molecular stiffness. Benefiting from the enlarged size and the antiaromatic character of pentagons, all of NNRs possessed ambipolar redox properties, especially for longer nanoribbons showing multiple reversible reductions and oxidations. In addition, experimental and theoretical results indicated a ground state open&#8208;shell singlet diradicaloid for the dication of longer NNRs. Our studies reveal the intriguing nonalternant structures and physical properties of this type of nanoribbons, involving the striking effects of the multiple annulated pentagons, and also provide fundamental insights into their electronic structures.

         <title>Bifunctional WC&#8208;Supported RuO2 Nanoparticles for Robust Water Splitting in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique 0D/2D WC&#8208;supported RuO2 nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanosheets with low loading of Ru (4.11&#8197;wt.%) were constructed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, applying a cell voltage of 1.66&#8197;V to realize acidic overall water splitting (OWS) with excellent long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
We report the strong catalyst&#8211;support interaction in WC&#8208;supported RuO2 nanoparticles (RuO2&#8208;WC NPs) anchored on carbon nanosheets with low loading of Ru (4.11&#8197;wt.%), which significantly promotes the oxygen evolution reaction activity with a &#951;10 of 347&#8197;mV and a mass activity of 1430&#8197;A&#8201;gRu&#8722;1, eight&#8208;fold higher than that of commercial RuO2 (176&#8197;A&#8201;gRu&#8722;1). Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the strong catalyst&#8211;support interaction between RuO2 and the WC support could optimize the surrounding electronic structure of Ru sites to reduce the reaction barrier. Considering the likewise excellent catalytic ability for hydrogen production, an acidic overall water splitting (OWS) electrolyzer with a good stability constructed by bifunctional RuO2&#8208;WC NPs only requires a cell voltage of 1.66&#8197;V to afford 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The unique 0D/2D nanoarchitectures rationally combining a WC support with precious metal oxides provides a promising strategy to tradeoff the high catalytic activity and low cost for acidic OWS applications.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, eight-fold higher than that of commercial RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (176&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;Ru&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the strong catalyst&#8211;support interaction between RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the WC support could optimize the surrounding electronic structure of Ru sites to reduce the reaction barrier. Considering the likewise excellent catalytic ability for hydrogen production, an acidic overall water splitting (OWS) electrolyzer with a good stability constructed by bifunctional RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-WC NPs only requires a cell voltage of 1.66&#8197;V to afford 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The unique 0D/2D nanoarchitectures rationally combining a WC support with precious metal oxides provides a promising strategy to tradeoff the high catalytic activity and low cost for acidic OWS applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tacticity Control of Cyclic Poly(3&#8208;Thiobutyrate) Prepared by Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Racemic &#946;&#8208;Thiobutyrolactone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isotactic or syndiotactic cyclic poly(3&#8208;thiobutyrolactone) (P3TB) was obtained from ring&#8208;opening polymerization of racemic &#946;&#8208;thiobutyrolactone (rac&#8208;TBL) promoted by achiral yttrium catalysts. The tacticity of cyclic polythioesters can be readily switched upon tuning the bulkiness of the substituents on the catalyst ligand.







Abstract
We report here on the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of racemic &#946;&#8208;thiobutyrolactone (rac&#8208;TBL), as the first chemical synthesis of poly(3&#8208;thiobutyrolactone) (P3TB), the thioester analogue of the ubiquitous poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB). The ROP reactions proceed very fast (TOF &gt;12&#8201;000&#8197;h&#8722;1 at r.t.) in the presence of various metal&#8208;based catalysts. Remarkably, catalyst systems based on non&#8208;chiral yttrium complexes stabilized by tetradentate amino alkoxy&#8208; or diamino&#8208;bis(phenolate) ligands {ONXOR1,R2}2&#8722; (X=O, N) provide access to cyclic P3TB with either high isoselectivity (Pm up to 0.90) or high syndiotactic bias (Pr up to 0.70). The stereoselectivity can be controlled by manipulation of the substituents on the ligand platform and adequate choice of the reaction solvent and temperature as well. The cyclic polymer topology is evidenced by MALDI&#8208;ToF MS, NMR and TGA. Highly isotactic cyclic P3TB is a semi&#8208;crystalline material as revealed by DSC.

         <title>Entropy Enhanced Perovskite Oxide Ceramic for Efficient Electrochemical Reduction of Oxygen to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy perovskite oxide ceramic Pb(NiWMnNbZrTi)1/6O3 electrocatalyst has been synthesized on a kilogram&#8208;scale via the thermal&#8208;induced solid solution method that delivers efficient H2O2 production by an oxygen reduction reaction and spontaneously degrades organic dyes through the Fenton reaction.







Abstract
The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers a most promising and efficient route to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), yet the lack of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts have restricted its practical application. Herein, an entropy&#8208;enhancement strategy has been employed to enable the low&#8208;cost perovskite oxide to effectively catalyze the electrosynthesis of H2O2. The optimized Pb(NiWMnNbZrTi)1/6O3 ceramic is available on a kilogram&#8208;scale and displays commendable ORR activity in alkaline media with high selectivity over 91&#8201;% across the wide potential range for H2O2 including an outstanding degradation property for organic dyes through the Fenton process. The exceptional performance of this perovskite oxide is attributed to the entropy stabilization&#8208;induced polymorphic transformation assuring the robust structural stability, decreased charge mobility as well as synergistic catalytic effects which we confirm using advanced in situ Raman, transient photovoltage, Rietveld refinement as well as finite elemental analysis.

         <title>Direct Asymmetric Reductive Amination of Alkyl (Hetero)Aryl Ketones by an Engineered Amine Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel amine dehydrogenase (Ja&#8208;AmDH) has been developed by a directed evolution approach for the direct asymmetric reductive amination of alkyl (hetero)aryl ketones. The engineered enzyme provided access to a series of chiral &#945;&#8208;(hetero)aryl primary amines in high yields with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The direct asymmetric reductive amination of heteroaryl ketones has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge. Here we report the engineering of an amine dehydrogenase (AmDH) from Jeotgalicoccus aerolatus for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;(hetero)aryl primary amines in excellent conversions (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The best AmDH variant (Ja&#8208;AmDH&#8208;M33) exhibited high activity and specificity toward alkyl (hetero)aryl ketones, even for those bearing a bulky alkyl chain. An efficient directed evolution approach based on molecular docking was implemented to enlarge the active pocket with a more hydrophobic entrance, which is responsible for the high activity. The Ja&#8208;AmDH&#8208;M33 was also used for preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant amines and a key intermediate of chiral pincer ligands, which highlighted its practical application in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>A Dual pH&#8208; and Light&#8208;Responsive Spiropyran&#8208;Based Surfactant: Investigations on Its Switching Behavior and Remote Control over Emulsion Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spiropyran&#8208;based cationic surfactant is presented. Its architecture renders the molecule dual&#8208;responsive, possessing thereby an unexpected switching behaviour: While photo&#8208;stimulation influences the surface&#8208;active behaviour of the compound under acidified conditions, no notable photo&#8208;responsiveness is observed at pH&#8208;values &gt;6.5. This effect is demonstrated by manipulating the integrity of an oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsion.







Abstract
A cationic surfactant containing a spiropyran unit is prepared exhibiting a dual&#8208;responsive adjustability of its surface&#8208;active characteristics. The switching mechanism of the system relies on the reversible conversion of the non&#8208;ionic spiropyran (SP) to a zwitterionic merocyanine (MC) and can be controlled by adjusting the pH value and via light, resulting in a pH&#8208;dependent photoactivity: While the compound possesses a pronounced difference in surface activity between both forms under acidic conditions, this behavior is suppressed at a neutral pH level. The underlying switching processes are investigated in detail, and a thermodynamic explanation based on a combination of theoretical and experimental results is provided. This complex stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior enables remote&#8208;control of colloidal systems. To demonstrate its applicability, the surfactant is utilized for the pH&#8208;dependent manipulation of oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions.

         <title>Photoredox Activation of Inert Alkyl Chlorides for the Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling with Aromatic Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoredox activation of inert chloroalkanes for the cross&#8208;coupling reaction with olefins, with a broad functional group tolerance under mild conditions is presented. By combining UV/Vis spectroscopy, EPR, radical clock and deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments, [Ni(Py2Tstacn)]+ is proposed to be catalytically competent to activate the Csp3&#8722;Cl bond, forming a free radical, which reacts with the alkene.







Abstract
The inertness of chloroalkanes has precluded them as coupling partners for cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Herein we disclose a general strategy for the activation of inert alkyl chlorides through photoredox catalysis and their use as coupling partners with alkenes. The catalytic system is formed by [Ni(OTf)(Py2Tstacn)](OTf) (1Ni), which is responsible for the Csp3&#8722;Cl bond activation, and [Ir(NMe2bpy)(ppy)2]PF6, (PCIrNMe2), which is the photoredox catalyst. Combined experimental and theoretical studies show an in&#8197;situ photogenerated NiI intermediate ([Ni(Py2Tstacn)]+) which is catalytically competent for the Csp3&#8722;Cl bond cleavage via a SN2 mechanism for primary alkyl chlorides, forming carbon&#8208;centered free radicals, which react with the olefin leading to the formation of the Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bond. These results suggest inert alkyl chlorides can be electrophiles for developing new intermolecular strategies in which low&#8208;valent aminopyridine nickel complexes act as key catalytic species.

         <title>Oligomer&#8208;Assisted Photoactive Layers Enable &gt;18&#8201;% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A new concept of oligomer&#8208;assisted high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs) was proposed. Developing the oligomer&#8208;assisted OSCs is a facile and general strategy with the combination of the advantages of both binary and ternary devices, which enables &gt;18&#8201;% device efficiency together with improved stability.







Abstract
Although ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) have unique advantages in improving device performance, the morphology assembly in the ternary&#8208;phase would be more uncertain or complex than that in the binary&#8208;phase. Here, we propose a new concept of oligomer&#8208;assisted photoactive layers for high&#8208;performance OSCs. The formed alloy&#8208;like phase of the oligomer&#8201;:&#8201;host polymer blend enabled the oligomer&#8208;assisted OSCs to fuse the advantages of both binary and ternary devices, exhibiting substantially enhanced performance and stability compared to the control devices. With the addition of oligomers, outstanding efficiencies of 17.33&#8201;% for a PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 device, 18.32&#8201;% for a PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9 device, and 17.13&#8201;% for a PM6/Y6 pseudo&#8208;bilayer device were achieved, all of which are one of the highest values in their corresponding fields. The improved performance originated from the downshift energy levels, enhanced light absorption, optimized blend morphology, favorable charge dynamics, and reduced non&#8208;radiative energy loss.

         <title>Versatile Vibrational Energy Sensors for Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tool kit of non&#8208;canonical amino acids for site&#8208;resolved sensing of vibrational energy transfer (VET) in proteins is established. The actual sensor is an azide or nitrile group attached to different side chains for compatibility with different protein sites. Ultrafast spectroscopy experiments on peptides and a protein ensure comparability of the sensors, allowing for choosing the best for a given site.







Abstract
Vibrational energy transfer (VET) is emerging as key mechanism for protein functions, possibly playing an important role for energy dissipation, allosteric regulation, and enzyme catalysis. A deep understanding of VET is required to elucidate its role in such processes. Ultrafast VIS&#8208;pump/IR&#8208;probe spectroscopy can detect pathways of VET in proteins. However, the requirement of having a VET donor and a VET sensor installed simultaneously limits the possible target proteins and sites; to increase their number we compare six IR labels regarding their utility as VET sensors. We compare these labels in terms of their FTIR, and VET signature in VET donor&#8208;sensor dipeptides in different solvents. Furthermore, we incorporated four of these labels in PDZ3 to assess their capabilities in more complex systems. Our results show that different IR labels can be used interchangeably, allowing for free choice of the right label depending on the system under investigation and the methods available.

         <title>In Situ Halogen&#8208;Ion Leaching Regulates Multiple Sites on Tandem Catalysts for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interplay of dual components in tandem catalysts is uncovered and utilized during the electrochemical reconstruction for promoting CO2 electroreduction to C2+ products. Taking AgI&#8722;CuO as a conceptual tandem catalyst, in situ iodine ions leaching from AgI restrain the entire reduction of CuO to acquire stable active Cu0/Cu+ species, thus achieving a high C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 68.9&#8201;%.







Abstract
Tandem catalysts can divide the reaction into distinct steps by local multiple sites and thus are attractive to trigger CO2RR to C2+ products. However, the evolution of catalysts generally exists during CO2RR, thus a closer investigation of the reconstitution, interplay, and active origin of dual components in tandem catalysts is warranted. Here, taking AgI&#8722;CuO as a conceptual tandem catalyst, we uncovered the interaction of two phases during the electrochemical reconstruction. Multiple operando techniques unraveled that in situ iodine ions leaching from AgI restrained the entire reduction of CuO to acquire stable active Cu0/Cu+ species during the CO2RR. This way, the residual iodine species of the Ag matrix accelerated CO generation and iodine&#8208;induced Cu0/Cu+ promotes C&#8722;C coupling. This self&#8208;adaptive dual&#8208;optimization endowed our catalysts with an excellent C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 68.9&#8201;%. Material operando changes in this work offer a new approach for manipulating active species towards enhancing C2+ products.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Redox Looping of a Rhodium/CexWO3 Photocatalyst for Highly Active and Robust Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyst for dry reforming of methane, Rh/CexWO3, invokes both photothermal and photoelectric activation processes. Light&#8208;induced metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer takes place in the photocatalyst, which induces a redox looping between Ce to W species. High oxygen mobility of CexWO3, accompanied with the formation of oxo&#8208;bridge species, results in a substantial elimination of deposited C species during the reaction.







Abstract
Dry reforming of methane (DRM) has provided an effective avenue to convert two greenhouse gases, CH4 and CO2, into syngas. Here, we design a DRM photocatalyst Rh/CexWO3 that invokes both photothermal and photoelectric processes, which overcomes the thermodynamic limitation of DRM under conventional conditions. In contrast to plasmonic or UV&#8208;response photocatalysts, our photocatalyst produces a superior light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency (LTCEE) of 4.65&#8201;% with a moderate light intensity. We propose that a light&#8208;induced metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer plays a crucial role in the DRM reaction, which induces a redox looping between Ce to W species to lower the activation energy.

&lt;p&gt;A photocatalyst for dry reforming of methane, Rh/Ce&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, invokes both photothermal and photoelectric activation processes. Light-induced metal-to-metal charge transfer takes place in the photocatalyst, which induces a redox looping between Ce to W species. High oxygen mobility of Ce&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, accompanied with the formation of oxo-bridge species, results in a substantial elimination of deposited C species during the reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dry reforming of methane (DRM) has provided an effective avenue to convert two greenhouse gases, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, into syngas. Here, we design a DRM photocatalyst Rh/Ce&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that invokes both photothermal and photoelectric processes, which overcomes the thermodynamic limitation of DRM under conventional conditions. In contrast to plasmonic or UV-response photocatalysts, our photocatalyst produces a superior light-to-chemical energy efficiency (LTCEE) of 4.65&#8201;% with a moderate light intensity. We propose that a light-induced metal-to-metal charge transfer plays a crucial role in the DRM reaction, which induces a redox looping between Ce to W species to lower the activation energy. Quantum mechanical studies reveal that a high oxygen mobility of Ce&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, accompanied with the formation of oxo-bridge species, results in a substantial elimination of deposited C species during the reaction. Our catalyst design strategy could offer a promising energy-efficient industrial process for DRM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Ion&#8208;Incorporated Mussel&#8208;Inspired Poly(Vinyl Alcohol)&#8208;Based Polymer Coating Offers Improved Antibacterial Activity and Cellular Mechanoresponse Manipulation</title>

A metal ion&#8208;triggered enhanced stiffness of poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based polymer coating incorporated with bioactive cobalt ions was designed. This surface coating platform not only exhibited durable and excellent antibacterial activity, but also manipulates cellular functions with enhanced mechanosensing that facilitates the cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation on the surface coating.







Abstract
Cobalt (CoII) ions have been an attractive candidate for the biomedical modification of orthopedic implants for decades. However, limited research has been performed into how immobilized CoII ions affect the physical properties of implant devices and how these changes regulate cellular behavior. In this study we modified biocompatible poly(vinyl alcohol) with terpyridine and catechol groups (PVA&#8208;TP&#8208;CA) to create a stable surface coating in which bioactive metal ions could be anchored, endowing the coating with improved broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as enhanced surface stiffness and cellular mechanoresponse manipulation. Strengthened by the addition of these metal ions, the coating elicited enhanced mechanosensing from adjacent cells, facilitating cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation on the surface coating. This dual&#8208;functional PVA&#8208;TP&#8208;CA/Co surface coating offers a promising approach for improving clinical implantation outcomes.

A robust carbon&#8208;covered indium oxide electrocatalyst demonstrates an enhanced and stable activity for the direct production of formic acid in a solid&#8208;state carbon dioxide electrolyzer.







Abstract
Developing robust electrocatalysts and advanced devices is important for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction toward the generation of valuable chemicals. We present herein a carbon&#8208;confined indium oxide electrocatalyst for stable and efficient CO2 reduction. The reductive corrosion of oxidative indium to the metallic state during electrolysis could be prevented by carbon protection, and the applied carbon layer also optimizes the reaction intermediate adsorption, which enables both high selectivity and activity for CO2 reduction. In a liquid&#8208;phase flow cell, the formate selectivity exceeds 90&#8201;% in a wide potential window from &#8722;0.8&#8197;V to &#8722;1.3&#8197;V vs. RHE. The continuous production of ca. 0.12&#8197;M pure formic acid solution is further demonstrated at a current density of 30&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a solid&#8208;state electrolyte mediated reactor. This work provides significant concepts in the parallel development of electrocatalysts and devices for carbon&#8208;neutral technologies.

         <title>A Liquid Interfacial SERS Platform on a Nanoparticle Array Stabilized by Rigid Probes for the Quantification of Norepinephrine in Rat Brain Microdialysates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high reproducibility liquid interfacial SERS platform was created for the accurate quantification of the variation of norepinephrine (NE) in rat brain microdialysis during stress. Rigid probe molecules efficiently fixed the interparticle gap, guaranteeing reproducible SERS analysis and selective recognition of NE. Using this powerful tool, it was discovered that the treatment of stress induced anxiety was regulated by c&#8208;fos.







Abstract
For the reliable determination of trace chemicals in the brain, we created a SERS platform based on a functionalized AuNPs array formed at a liquid/liquid interface in a uniform fashion over a large substrate area through ternary regulations for real&#8208;time quantification of trace norepinephrine (NE). The rigid molecule, 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;ylethynyl)&#8208;benzaldehyde (RP1) was designed and co&#8208;assembled at AuNPs with 4&#8208;mercaptophenylboronic acid (MPBA) to chemically define NE via dual recognition. Meanwhile, the rigid structure assembly of RP1 and MPBA efficiently fixed the interparticle gap, guaranteeing reproducible SERS analysis. Furthermore, the Raman peak of C&#8801;C group in the silent region was taken as a response element to further improve the accuracy. Combined with microdialysis, this SERS platform was developed for in&#8208;the&#8208;field testing of NE in rat brain microdialysates following anxiety.

         <title>Tuning the High&#8208;Pressure Phase Behaviour of Highly Compressible Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks: From Discontinuous to Continuous Pore Closure by Linker Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adjusting the ratio of different imidazolate linkers modulates a high&#8208;pressure open&#8208;pore to closed&#8208;pore phase transition of a series of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) from first order to second order. The second&#8208;order phase transition allows finetuning the pore structure of the framework material by regulation of the mechanical pressure.







Abstract
The high&#8208;pressure behaviour of flexible zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) of the ZIF&#8208;62 family with the chemical composition M(im)2&#8722;x(bim)x is presented (M2+=Zn2+, Co2+; im&#8722;=imidazolate; bim&#8722;=benzimidazolate, 0.02&#8804;x&#8804;0.37). High&#8208;pressure powder X&#8208;ray diffraction shows that the materials contract reversibly from an open pore (op) to a closed pore (cp) phase under a hydrostatic pressure of up to 4000&#8197;bar. Sequentially increasing the bim&#8722; fraction (x) reinforces the framework, leading to an increased threshold pressure for the op&#8208;to&#8208;cp phase transition, while the total volume contraction across the transition decreases. Most importantly, the typical discontinuous op&#8208;to&#8208;cp transition (first order) changes to an unusual continuous transition (second order) for x&#8805;0.35. This allows finetuning of the void volume and the pore size of the material continuously by adjusting the pressure, thus opening new possibilities for MOFs in pressure&#8208;switchable devices, membranes, and actuators.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Layered Cu5 Nanoclusters on FeS2 with Dual Catalytic Sites for Efficient and Selective H2O2 Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual Cu&#8722;Fe catalytic centers situated at the perimeter region of Cu5/FeS2 facilitate H2O2 adsorption and barrierless decomposition into &#8901;OH through forming a bridging Cu&#8208;O&#8208;O&#8208;Fe structure, thereby realizing selective H2O2 activation with high efficiency and enabling excellent degradation activities of refractory organic pollutants.







Abstract
Regulating the distribution of reactive oxygen species generated from H2O2 activation is the prerequisite to ensuring the efficient and safe use of H2O2 in the chemistry and life science fields. Herein, we demonstrate that constructing a dual Cu&#8722;Fe site through the self&#8208;assembly of single&#8208;atomic&#8208;layered Cu5 nanoclusters onto a FeS2 surface achieves selective H2O2 activation with high efficiency. Unlike its unitary Cu or Fe counterpart, the dual Cu&#8722;Fe sites residing at the perimeter zone of the Cu5/FeS2 interface facilitate H2O2 adsorption and barrierless decomposition into &#8901;OH via forming a bridging Cu&#8208;O&#8208;O&#8208;Fe complex. The robust in situ formation of &#8901;OH governed by this atomic&#8208;layered catalyst enables the effective oxidation of several refractory toxic pollutants across a broad pH range, including alachlor, sulfadimidine, p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, p&#8208;chlorophenol, p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene. This work highlights the concept of building a dual catalytic site in manipulating selective H2O2 activation on the surface molecular level towards efficient environmental control and beyond.

         <title>Combination of Knoevenagel Polycondensation and Water&#8208;Assisted Dynamic Michael&#8208;Addition&#8208;Elimination for the Synthesis of Vinylene&#8208;Linked 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

Synthesis of vinylene&#8208;linked 2D COFs via Knoevenagel polycondensation and in situ water&#8208;assisted Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination: The addition of water can accelerate the Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination for C=C bond exchange.







Abstract
Vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic frameworks (V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs), belonging to the class of two&#8208;dimensional conjugated polymers, have attracted increasing attention due to their extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation over the 2D backbones associated with high chemical stability. The Knoevenagel polycondensation has been demonstrated as a robust synthetic method to provide cyano (CN)&#8208;substituted V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs with unique optoelectronic, magnetic, and redox properties. Despite the successful synthesis, it remains elusive for the relevant polymerization mechanism, which leads to relatively low crystallinity and poor reproducibility. In this work, we demonstrate the novel synthesis of CN&#8208;substituted V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs via the combination of Knoevenagel polycondensation and water&#8208;assisted dynamic Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination, abbreviated as KMAE polymerization. The existence of C=C bond exchange between two diphenylacrylonitriles (M1 and M6) is firstly confirmed via in situ high&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy study of model reactions. Notably, the intermediate M4 synthesized via Michael&#8208;addition can proceed the Michael&#8208;elimination quantitatively, leading to an efficient C=C bond exchange, unambiguously confirming the dynamic nature of Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination. Furthermore, the addition of water can significantly promote the reaction rate of Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination for highly efficient C=C bond exchange within 5&#8197;mins. As a result, the KMAE polymerization provides a highly efficient strategy for the synthesis of CN&#8208;substituted V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs with high crystallinity, as demonstrated by four examples of V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;TFPB&#8208;PDAN, V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;TFPT&#8208;PDAN, V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;TFPB&#8208;BDAN, and V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;HATN&#8208;BDAN, based on the simulated and experimental powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns as well as N2&#8208;adsorption&#8211;desorption measurements. Moreover, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR&#8208;TEM) analysis shows crystalline domain sizes ranging from 20 to 100&#8197;nm for the newly synthesized V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vinylene-linked two-dimensional conjugated covalent organic frameworks (V-2D-COFs), belonging to the class of two-dimensional conjugated polymers, have attracted increasing attention due to their extended &#960;-conjugation over the 2D backbones associated with high chemical stability. The Knoevenagel polycondensation has been demonstrated as a robust synthetic method to provide cyano (CN)-substituted V-2D-COFs with unique optoelectronic, magnetic, and redox properties. Despite the successful synthesis, it remains elusive for the relevant polymerization mechanism, which leads to relatively low crystallinity and poor reproducibility. In this work, we demonstrate the novel synthesis of CN-substituted V-2D-COFs via the combination of Knoevenagel polycondensation and water-assisted dynamic Michael-addition-elimination, abbreviated as &lt;b&gt;KMAE&lt;/b&gt; polymerization.

Notably, the intermediate &lt;b&gt;M4&lt;/b&gt; synthesized via Michael-addition can proceed the Michael-elimination quantitatively, leading to an efficient C=C bond exchange, unambiguously confirming the dynamic nature of Michael-addition-elimination. Furthermore, the addition of water can significantly promote the reaction rate of Michael-addition-elimination for highly efficient C=C bond exchange within 5&#8197;mins.

         <title>A Platform for Stop&#8208;Flow Gradient Generation to Investigate Chemotaxis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus microswimmers show positive and negative chemotaxis behavior in a microfluidic assay. A flow&#8208;based linear gradient is generated and the flow is stopped during the chemotaxis assay using a retroactive pressure loop.







Abstract
The ability of artificial microswimmers to respond to external stimuli and the mechanistical details of their origins belong to the most disputed challenges in interdisciplinary science. Therein, the creation of chemical gradients is technically challenging, because they quickly level out due to diffusion. Inspired by pivotal stopped flow experiments in chemical kinetics, we show that microfluidics gradient generation combined with a pressure feedback loop for precisely controlling the stop of the flows, can enable us to study mechanistical details of chemotaxis of artificial Janus micromotors, based on a catalytic reaction. We find that these copper Janus particles display a chemotactic motion along the concentration gradient in both, positive and negative direction and we demonstrate the mechanical reaction of the particles to unbalanced drag forces, explaining this behaviour.

Molecular trefoil knots are usually covalently assembled from rationally designed building blocks with multiple functional groups. In their Research Article (e202200748), Jie&#8208;Sheng Huang, Chi&#8208;Ming Che, and co&#8208;workers report on the use of monoalkynes and a mononuclear AuI compound for the self&#8208;assembly of Au&#8722;C bonded Au15 trefoil knots featuring non&#8208;covalent AuI&#8211;AuI interactions. The structures, solution behavior, and photoluminescence properties of the Au15 and Au9M6 (M=Cu/Ag) trefoil knots were studied.

         <title>Inside Cover: Generation and Release of OH Radicals from the Reaction of H2O with O2 over Soot (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 21/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conventional view is that particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere is a major sink of OH radicals. By contrast, Xiao Cheng&#8197;Zeng, Joseph&#8197;S. Francisco, Hong He, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate in their Communication (e202201638) that water and O2 react on carbonaceous soot surface and give rise to gaseous OH radicals under irradiation. This new chemical mechanism for the generation of OH radicals indicates that airborne soot particles possess important catalytic oxidation capacity.

         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;swapping method for the synthesis of metallabenzenes, where a phosphorus atom on phosphinine is replaced by a transition&#8208;metal fragment, is reported by Kyoko Nozaki and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202117096). Swapping of the P&#8197;atom for Rh or Ir proceeded by oxidation of the phosphorus atom and subsequent reductive cleavage of the C&#8722;P bond of the phosphinine ring.

         <dc:description>
Vibrational energy transfer in proteins has been related to enzyme catalysis, energy dissipation, and allosteric communication. In their Research Article (e202200648), Jens Bredenbeck et&#8197;al. establish a broad palette of vibrational energy sensors. A variety of functionalities are used to cover chemical and steric diversity. Their comparable responsivity allows for choosing a suitable non&#8208;canonical amino acid for each site, as exemplified for a showcase allosteric protein.

         <title>Chemical Biology Tools for Protein Lysine Acylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical biology tools have emerged as a highly significant and promising means to investigate lysine post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs). This Review discusses different strategies using chemical biology probes to study lysine acylation and related regulatory proteins. Solutions to overcome problems in existing systems and future research directions are also proposed.







Abstract
Lysine acylation plays pivotal roles in cell physiology, including DNA transcription and repair, signal transduction, immune defense, metabolism, and many other key cellular processes. Molecular mechanisms of dysregulated lysine acylation are closely involved in the pathophysiological progress of many human diseases, most notably cancers. In recent years, chemical biology tools have become instrumental in studying the function of post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs), identifying new &#8220;writers&#8221;, &#8220;erasers&#8221; and &#8220;readers&#8221;, and in targeted therapies. Here, we describe key developments in chemical biology approaches that have advanced the study of lysine acylation and its regulatory proteins (2016&#8211;2021). We further discuss the discovery of ligands (inhibitors and PROTACs) that are capable of targeting regulators of lysine acylation. Next, we discuss some current challenges of these chemical biology probes and suggest how chemists and biologists can utilize chemical probes with more discriminating capacity. Finally, we suggest some critical considerations in future studies of PTMs from our perspective.

We further discuss the discovery of ligands (inhibitors and PROTACs) that are capable of targeting regulators of lysine acylation. Next, we discuss some current challenges of these chemical biology probes and suggest how chemists and biologists can utilize chemical probes with more discriminating capacity. Finally, we suggest some critical considerations in future studies of PTMs from our perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved In&#8197;Situ Monitoring of Mechanochemical Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved in&#8197;situ analysis opens the black box. Within the last few years, time&#8208;resolved in&#8197;situ (TRIS) analysis has revolutionized the field of mechanochemistry. This Minireview highlights the insights gained in mechanochemical transformations, thereby paving the way for future academic and industrial breakthroughs of mechanochemisty as a green and sustainable approach for designing new materials.







Abstract
Mechanochemical transformations offer environmentally benign synthesis routes, whilst enhancing both the speed and selectivity of reactions. In this regard, mechanochemistry promises to transform the way in which chemistry is done in both academia and industry but is greatly hindered by a current lack of mechanistic understanding. The continued development and use of time&#8208;resolved in&#8197;situ (TRIS) approaches to monitor mechanochemical reactions provides a new dimension to elucidate these fascinating transformations. We here discuss recent trends in method development that have pushed the boundaries of mechanochemical research. New features of mechanochemical reactions obtained by TRIS techniques are subsequently discussed, which sheds light on how different TRIS approaches have been used. Emphasis is placed on the strength of combining complementary techniques. Finally, we outline our views on the potential of TRIS methods in mechanochemical research, towards establishing a new, environmentally benign paradigm in the chemical sciences.

         <title>Asymmetric Intramolecular Hydroalkoxylation of 2&#8208;Vinylbenzyl Alcohols with Chiral Boro&#8208;Phosphates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral boro&#8208;phosphates were developed from chiral phosphoric acids and Piers&#8217; borane via the release of H2. A highly enantioselective hydroalkoxylation of 2&#8208;vinylbenzyl alcohols was further demonstrated, furnishing optically active 1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran derivatives in high yields with up to 97&#8201;% ee. It is supposed that these boro&#8208;phosphates possibly interact with the substrates through O&#8722;H bond activation.







Abstract
Asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of alkenes represents a very important approach to access optically active cyclic ethers. It was found that B(C6F5)3 could catalyze the cyclization of 2&#8208;vinylbenzyl alcohols with only 0.05&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading, affording the desired product in high yields. To accomplish the asymmetric reaction, a novel type of chiral boro&#8208;phosphates was developed by treating chiral phosphoric acid with Piers&#8217; borane, in which the oxygen atom of P=O and the boron atom act as Lewis base and acid centers, respectively. A highly enantioselective hydroalkoxylation was successfully realized to give optically active 1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran derivatives in 78&#8211;99&#8201;% yields with 60&#8211;97&#8201;% ee's, in which an activation of O&#8722;H bond of alcohols by the boro&#8208;phosphate species is hypothesized.

         <title>An Acid&#8208;Regulated Self&#8208;Blinking Fluorescent Probe for Resolving Whole&#8208;Cell Lysosomes with Long&#8208;Term Nanoscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
LysoSR&#8208;549 as a self&#8208;blinking fluorophore for SMLM imaging of lysosomes is reported. It enables simultaneous dynamic and pH recognition of all lysosomes in the entire cell at the single&#8208;lysosome&#8208;resolved level, which allowed to resolve whole&#8208;cell lysosome subpopulations based on lysosome distribution, size, luminal pH, movement trajectories and interactions between lysosomes.







Abstract
Long&#8208;term super&#8208;resolution imaging appears to be increasingly important for unraveling organelle dynamics at the nanoscale, but is challenging due to the need for highly photostable and environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probes. Here, we report a self&#8208;blinking fluorophore that achieved 12&#8197;nm spatial resolution and 20&#8197;ms time resolution under acidic lysosomal conditions. This fluorophore was successfully applied in super&#8208;resolution imaging of lysosomal dynamics over 40&#8197;min. The pH dependence of the dye during blinking made the fluorophore sensitive to lysosomal pH. This probe enables simultaneous dynamic and pH recognition of all lysosomes in the entire cell at the single&#8208;lysosome&#8208;resolved level, which allowed us to resolve whole&#8208;cell lysosome subpopulations based on lysosomal distribution, size, and luminal pH. We also observed a variety of lysosome movement trajectories and different types of interactions modes between lysosomes.

         <title>Enantiomeric Water&#8208;Soluble Octopus[3]arenes for Highly Enantioselective Recognition of Chiral Ammonium Salts in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiomeric water&#8208;soluble octopus[3]arenes with rigid hexagonal structures and stable chiral hydrophobic cavities were easily synthesized. They exhibited highly enantioselective recognition towards three pairs of chiral ammonium salts in water with the association constant up to 106 and the S/R selectivity up to 12.89.







Abstract
Study of enantioselective recognition in water by synthetic chiral macrocyclic receptors is undoubtedly of theoretical and practical significance, but it is a big challenge to achieve the enantioselective recognition with both high enantioselectivity and high affinity in water probably due to the deficiency of such water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic receptors with stable chiral cavities. Herein, we report a new class of chiral macrocyclic arenes named octopus[3]arenes. The enantiomeric macrocycles are composed of three homochiral ethenoanthracene subunits, and they can be synthesized by two pathways and then easily converted into water&#8208;soluble octopus[3]arenes P&#8208;1 and M&#8208;1. Notably, P&#8208;1 and M&#8208;1 with the rigid hexagonal structures and stable chiral hydrophobic cavities exhibit highly enantioselective recognition towards three pairs of chiral ammonium salts in water with the association constant up to 106&#8197;M&#8722;1 and the S/R selectivity up to 12.89.

         <title>Tuning the Spin State of the Iron Center by Bridge&#8208;Bonded Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti Ligands for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin&#8208;state tuning for atomic Fe centers (FeN3O) is attained through introducing an axial Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti bridge bond in atomic&#8208;Fe doped polymer&#8208;like quantum dots/ultrathin o&#8208;terminated MXene (o&#8208;MQFe) hybrids. This low&#8208;to&#8208;medium spin&#8208;state transition gives the o&#8208;MQFe catalyst stronger O2 adsorption affinity and thus a higher intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity.







Abstract
Exploring functional substrates and precisely regulating the electronic structures of atomic metal active species with moderate spin state are of great importance yet remain challenging. Hereon, we provide an axial Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti ligand regulated spin&#8208;state transition strategy to improve the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Fe centers. Theoretical calculations indicate that Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti ligands in FeN3O&#8208;O&#8208;Ti can induce a low&#8208;to&#8208;medium spin&#8208;state transition and optimize O2 adsorption by FeN3O. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the oriented catalyst was prepared from atomic&#8208;Fe&#8208;doped polymer&#8208;like quantum dots and ultrathin o&#8208;terminated MXene. The optimal catalyst exhibits an intrinsic activity that is almost 5&#8197;times higher than the control sample (without axial Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti ligands). It also delivers a superior performance in Zn&#8208;air batteries and H2/O2 anion exchange membrane fuel cells in a wide&#8208;temperature range.

&lt;p&gt;The spin-state tuning for atomic Fe centers (FeN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O) is attained through introducing an axial Fe-O-Ti bridge bond in atomic-Fe doped polymer-like quantum dots/ultrathin o-terminated MXene (o-MQFe) hybrids. This low-to-medium spin-state transition gives the o-MQFe catalyst stronger O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption affinity and thus a higher intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Generation and Release of OH Radicals from the Reaction of H2O with O2 over Soot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chemical mechanism for the generation of gaseous OH radicals by the reaction of H2O with O2 over soot was revealed, which indicates the airborne soot particles generated by the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons may entail important catalytic oxidation capacity.







Abstract
OH radicals in the air maintain the oxidizing power of the troposphere. A conventional view is that particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere is a major sink of OH radicals, thereby lowering the oxidizing power of atmosphere in the event of high&#8208;level PM. By contrary, our joint experimental/theoretical study reveals a new mechanism for the generation of gaseous OH radicals by carbonaceous soot particles. We show that water and O2 react on carbonaceous surfaces and give rise to gaseous OH radicals under irradiation. With ample delocalized &#960; electrons, carbonaceous surfaces enable the easy desorption of hydroxyl groups to produce gaseous OH radicals, evidenced by direct observation of the steady generation of OH radicals on a carbonaceous surface. Our results reveal a new chemical mechanism for the production of OH radicals.

         <title>Cylindrical C96 Fullertubes: A Highly Active Metal&#8208;Free O2&#8208;Reduction Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen reduction electrocatalytic behavior of C60, C70 (spheroidal fullerenes), and C90, C96, and C100 (tubular fullerenes) is explored using a combination of experimental and theoretical techniques. C96 (a metal&#8208;free catalyst) displayed remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, with an onset potential of 0.85&#8197;V and a halfway potential of 0.75&#8197;V, which are close to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C benchmark catalyst values.







Abstract
A new isolation protocol was recently reported for highly purified metallic Fullertubes D5h&#8208;C90, D3d&#8208;C96, and D5d&#8208;C100, which exhibit unique electronic features. Here, we report the oxygen reduction electrocatalytic behavior of C60, C70 (spheroidal fullerenes), and C90, C96, and C100 (tubular fullerenes) using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. C96 (a metal&#8208;free catalyst) displayed remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, with an onset potential of 0.85&#8197;V and a halfway potential of 0.75&#8197;V, which are close to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C benchmark catalyst values. We achieved an excellent power density of 0.75&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 using C96 as a modified cathode in a proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell, comparable to other recently reported efficient metal&#8208;free catalysts. Combined band structure (experimentally calculated) and free&#8208;energy (DFT) investigations show that both favorable energy&#8208;level alignment active catalytic sites on the carbon cage are responsible for the superior activity of C96.

         <title>Asymmetric Defluoroallylation of 4&#8208;Trifluoromethylpyridines Enabled by Umpolung C&#8722;F Bond Activation**

         <dc:description>
Enantioselective defluorinative transformation of the trifluoromethyl group represents a formidable challenge. An asymmetric defluoroallylation reaction of 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridines and &#8208;pyrimidines is reported, which features an umpolung C&#8722;F bond activation, a broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Carbon&#8211;fluorine bond activation of the trifluoromethyl group represents an important approach to fluorine&#8208;containing molecules. While selective defluorinative functionalization reactions of CF3&#8208;containing substrates have been achieved by invoking difluorocarbocation, difluorocarboradical, or difluoroorganometallic species as the key intermediates, the transformations via fluorocarbanion mechanism only achieved limited success. Furthermore, the enantioselective defluorinative transformation of the CF3 group remained a formidable challenge. Here we report a defluorinative functionalization reaction of 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridines involving difluoro(pyrid&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyl anion as the key intermediate, which was developed based upon our previous studies on the N&#8208;boryl pyridyl anion chemistry. In particular, asymmetric defluoroallylation of 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridines and &#8208;pyrimidines could be achieved by using Ir&#8208;catalysis to forge a difluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted chiral center.

An enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation of heteroarenes for the synthesis of acyclic silicon&#8208;stereogenic heteroarylsilanes has been developed. This process proceeds via a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct intermolecular dehydrogenative Si&#8722;H/ C&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling, giving access to a variety of optically active silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereocontrol.







Abstract
Intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation for the synthesis of acyclic silanes bearing a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center in one enantiomeric form remains unknown to date. Herein, we report the first enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation of heteroarenes for the synthesis of acyclic silicon&#8208;stereogenic heteroarylsilanes. This process undergoes a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct intermolecular dehydrogenative Si&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling, giving access to a variety of acyclic heteroarylated silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes, including bis&#8208;Si&#8208;stereogenic silanes, in decent yields with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereo&#8208;control, which significantly enlarge the chemical space of the optically active silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes.

         <title>Aqueous Biphasic Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photosynthesis Cells for TEMPO&#8208;Based Oxidation of Glycerol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biphasic dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical cell for glycerol oxidation while producing H2 is presented. The redox&#8208;gel protects the photoanode from aqueous reaction conditions. The gel layer contained 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl and shuttles electrons between the photoexcited dye and glycerol at the biphasic interface. Employment of the redox&#8208;gel showed a 10&#8208;fold increase in glyceraldehyde production compared to the fully aqueous system.







Abstract
This work reports an aqueous dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical cell (DSPEC) capable of oxidizing glycerol (an archetypical biobased compound) coupled with H2 production. We employed a mesoporous TiO2 photoanode sensitized with the high potential thienopyrroledione&#8208;based dye AP11, encased in an acetonitrile&#8208;based redox&#8208;gel that protects the photoanode from degradation by aqueous electrolytes. The use of the gel creates a biphasic system with an interface at the organic (gel) electrode and aqueous anolyte. Embedded in the acetonitrile gel is 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO), acting as both a redox&#8208;mediator and a catalyst for oxidative transformations. Upon oxidation of TEMPO by the photoexcited dye, the in situ generated TEMPO+ shuttles through the gel to the acetonitrile&#8211;aqueous interface, where it acts as an oxidant for the selective conversion of glycerol to glyceraldehyde. The introduction of the redox&#8208;gel layer affords a 10&#8208;fold increase in the conversion of glycerol compared to the purely aqueous system. Our redox&#8208;gel protected photoanode yielded a stable photocurrent over 48&#8197;hours of continuous operation, demonstrating that this DSPEC is compatible with alkaline aqueous reactions.

         <title>Pushing the Length Limit of Dihydrodiboraacenes: Synthesis and Characterizations of Boron&#8208;Embedded Heptacene and Nonacene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihydrodiboraheptacene and dihydrodiboranonacene, the hitherto longest boron&#8208;embedded heteroacenes, have been successfully synthesized. Both compounds exhibit highly efficient anti&#8208;Kasha emissions through the thermal population mechanism, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of dihydrodiboraheptacene is as high as 98&#177;2&#8201;%. This work provides new opportunities for the development of novel boraacene&#8208;based functional materials.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;embedded heteroacenes (boraacenes) have attracted enormous interest in organic chemistry and materials science. However, extending the skeleton of boraacenes to higher acenes (N&#8805;6) is synthetically challenging because of their limited stability under ambient conditions. Herein, we report the synthesis of boron&#8208;embedded heptacene (DBH) and nonacene (DBN) as the hitherto longest boraacenes. The former is highly stable (even after 240&#8197;h in tetrahydrofuran), while the latter is air&#8208;sensitive with the half&#8208;life (t1/2) of 11.8&#8197;min. The structures of both compounds are verified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, revealing a linear backbone with an antiaromatic C4B2 core. Photophysical characterizations associated with theoretical calculations indicate that both compounds exhibit highly efficient anti&#8208;Kasha emissions. Remarkably, the air&#8208;stable DBH manifests an ultrahigh photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 98&#177;2&#8201;% and can be chemically reduced to its radical anion and dianion states, implying the value of boron&#8208;doped higher acenes as novel functional materials.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive C(sp2)&#8722;Si Coupling of Chlorohydrosilanes via Si&#8722;Cl Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new C&#8722;Si bond&#8208;forming reaction between R&#8722;X and Cl&#8722;Si(H)R2 was achieved using reductive nickel catalysis. This method offers access to structurally diverse aryl&#8208; and alkenylhydrosilanes from phenol and ketone derivatives. The reaction can be conducted on gram scale and allows for incorporating a hydrosilane moiety into biologically active molecules.







Abstract
We report here a new method for the synthesis of organohydrosilanes from phenols and ketones. This method is established through reductive C&#8722;Si coupling of chlorohydrosilanes via unconventional Si&#8722;Cl cleavage. The reaction offers access to aryl&#8208; and alkenylhydrosilanes with a scope that is complementary to those of the established methods. Electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;poor, and ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;substituted (hetero)aryl electrophiles, as well as cyclic and acyclic alkenyl electrophiles, were coupled successfully. Functionalities, including Grignard&#8208;sensitive groups (e.g., primary amine, amide, phenol, ketone, ester, and free indole), acid&#8208;sensitive groups (e.g., ketal and THP protection), alkyl&#8208;Cl, pyridine, furan, thiophene, Ar&#8208;Bpin, and Ar&#8208;SiMe3, were tolerated. Gram&#8208;scale reaction, incorporation of &#8208;Si(H)R2 into complex biologically active molecules, and derivatization of formed organohydrosilanes are demonstrated.

         <title>Yttrium&#8208;Catalyzed ortho&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Borylation of Pyridines with Pinacolborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ortho&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of a wide range of pyridines using pinacolborane was achieved through yttrium catalysis. Notably, the possible hydroboration side reaction was effectively suppressed by using the proper ligand/metal combination. The resultant 2&#8208;pyridyl boronates were subjected to further transformations such as a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling or the Chan&#8211;Lam amination.







Abstract
This work reports a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of pyridines at the ortho&#8208;position with pinacolborane enabled by an yttrocene catalyst. The reaction provides a new family of 2&#8208;pyridyl boronates with a broad substrate scope and high atom efficiency. The resultant boronates were able to undergo a variety of transformations, e.g., oxidation, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, Chan&#8211;Lam amination and etherification. Catalytic intermediates, including ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H metalated and borylated complexes, were isolated from stoichiometric experiments and confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Silylacylation of Allenes Using Acylsilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed addition of a C&#8722;Si bond in acylsilanes across allenes is reported. The reaction proceeds with complete regioselectivity, in which a silyl group binds to the central carbon of the allene, allowing for the straightforward access to functionalized alkenylsilane derivatives.







Abstract
We have developed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed addition of a C&#8722;Si bond of acylsilanes across a range of unactivated allenes. The reaction proceeds with complete regioselectivity, in which a silyl group binds to the central carbon of the allene, allowing for the straightforward access to functionalized alkenylsilane derivatives.

         <title>Enhancing Enzyme Activity by the Modulation of Covalent Interactions in the Confined Channels of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were utilized for the covalent immobilization of cytochrome c (Cyt c), offering protection for the Cyt c. The covalent interactions could induce the conformation changes of Cyt c giving a more accessible active site, and consequently enhanced activity.







Abstract
Controllable regulations on the enzyme conformation to optimize catalytic performance are highly desired for the immobilized biocatalysts yet remain challenging. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess confined channels with finely tunable pore environment, offering a promising platform for enzyme encapsulation. Herein, we covalently immobilized the cytochrome c (Cyt c) in the size&#8208;matched channels of COFs with different contents of anchoring site, and significant enhancement of the stability and activity (&#8776;600&#8201;% relative activity compared with free enzyme) can be realized by optimizing the covalent interactions. Structural analyses on the immobilized Cyt c suggest that covalent bonding could induce conformational perturbation resulting in more accessible active sites. The effectiveness of the covalent interaction modulation together with the tailorable confined channels of COFs offers promise to develop high&#8208;performance biocatalysts.

         <title>Competitive Doping Chemistry for Nickel&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model study has been performed on Group IIIA element (boron and aluminum) co&#8208;doped high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathode materials to understand competitive doping chemistry. A notable difference between the atomic radii of B and Al accounts for different spatial configurations of the hybridized orbital in bonding with lattice oxygen, resulting in the formation of a B&#8208;rich surface and an Al&#8208;rich bulk.







Abstract
Chemical modification of electrode materials by heteroatom dopants is crucial for improving storage performance in rechargeable batteries. Electron configurations of different dopants significantly influence the chemical interactions inbetween and the chemical bonding with the host material, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We revealed competitive doping chemistry of Group IIIA elements (boron and aluminum) taking nickel&#8208;rich cathode materials as a model. A notable difference between the atomic radii of B and Al accounts for different spatial configurations of the hybridized orbital in bonding with lattice oxygen. Density functional theory calculations reveal, Al is preferentially bonded to oxygen and vice versa, and shows a much lower diffusion barrier than BIII. In the case of Al&#8208;preoccupation, the bulk diffusion of BIII is hindered. In this way, a B&#8208;rich surface and Al&#8208;rich bulk is formed, which helps to synergistically stabilize the structural evolution and surface chemistry of the cathode.

         <title>Peptide Backbone Directed Self&#8208;Assembly of Merocyanine Oligomers into Duplex Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of peptide backbone connected merocyanine oligomers leads to the formation of DNA&#8208;like duplex structures containing two, four, and six chromophores. Whether self&#8208;assembly or folding is preferred depends on the length of the oligomers, as well as the concentration and polarity of the solvents.







Abstract
The pseudopeptide backbone provided by N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)&#8208;glycine oligomers with attached nucleobases has been widely utilized in peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) as DNA mimics. Here we demonstrate the suitability of this backbone for the formation of structurally defined dye stacks. Toward this goal a series of peptide merocyanine (PMC) dye oligomers connected to a N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)&#8208;glycine backbone were prepared through peptide synthesis. Our concentration&#8208;, temperature&#8208; and solvent&#8208;dependent UV/Vis absorption studies show that under the control of dipole&#8211;dipole interactions, smaller&#8208;sized oligomers consisting of one, two or three dyes self&#8208;assemble into defined duplex structures containing two up to six chromophores. In contrast, upon further extension of the oligomer, the chosen peptide backbone cannot direct the formation of a defined duplex architecture anymore due to intramolecular aggregation between the dyes. For all aggregate species a moderate aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement is observed.

         <title>Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3]: A Heteroanionic Nonlinear Optical Material Containing Planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated [CO3] and Heteroleptic [SnOSe3] Anionic Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteroanionic nonlinear optical material, Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3] has been synthesized. Its structure contains two different kinds of anionic groups: planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated [CO3] and heteroleptic [SnOSe3]. It exhibits promising properties including a large second harmonic generation (SHG) response (ca. 1&#215;AgGaS2), a wide band&#8208;gap (Eg) of 3.46&#8197;eV, a high laser damage threshold (LDT) of 240&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 as well as a wide transparent region.







Abstract
Inorganic heteroanionic materials are attracting increasing attention for exploring new nonlinear optical (NLO) materials because they could better satisfy the necessary but conflicting properties of NLO crystals, e.g. large SHG response and wide band&#8208;gap. Up to now, the reports on heteroanionic NLO materials have mainly focused on ultraviolet or visible oxide&#8208;based fluoroborates, fluorophosphates, borate&#8208;phosphates and borate&#8208;iodates. However, chalcogenides containing different kinds of anionic groups have barely been reported. Herein, we have synthesized the first oxychalcogenide&#8208;carbonate, Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3] that contains two different kinds of anionic groups, [SnOSe3] and [CO3]. It crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric space group and exhibits fascinating NLO properties, including a large SHG response (&#8776;1&#215;AGS), sufficient birefringence (0.12 @1064&#8197;nm), wide band&#8208;gap (3.46&#8197;eV) and high laser damage threshold (240&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). These make Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3] a promising NLO crystal.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer Cocrystal via a Persistent Radical Cation Acceptor for Efficient Solar&#8208;Thermal Conversion</title>

A unique charge&#8208;transfer cocrystal is constructed via a persistent 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azino&#8208;bis(3&#8208;ethylbenzothiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid) radical cation (ABTS+.) electron acceptor. The strong electron affinity and long&#8208;wavelength absorption of ABTS+. enable the resultant cocrystal with a full solar spectrum absorption, which yields an evaporation rate of 1.407&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of 97.0&#8201;% in solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation.







Abstract
Designing organic charge&#8208;transfer (CT) cocrystals for efficient solar&#8208;thermal conversion is a long&#8208;sought goal but remains challenging. Here we construct a unique CT cocrystal by using a persistent 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azino&#8208;bis(3&#8208;ethylbenzothiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid) radical cation (ABTS+.) as the electron acceptor. The strong persistency and electron affinity of ABTS+. endow a high degree of electron delocalization between ABTS+. and the 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine donor. Together with the intrinsic long&#8208;wavelength absorption of ABTS+., the synthesized cocrystal can effectively capture the full solar spectrum and show distinguished photothermal efficiency. Such a cocrystal is further used for solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation, and a high evaporation rate of 1.407&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of 97.0&#8201;% have been achieved upon 1 sun irradiation. This work indicates the enormous prospects for charge transfer&#8208;based functional materials through rational radical cation engineering.

         <title>para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Borylation of Aromatic Quaternary Ammonium and Phosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic sulfamate ligand based on a biphenyl&#8208;phenanthroline skeleton was designed and applied to the para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of aromatic quaternary ammonium and phosphonium salts. Mechanistic studies and computational analysis elucidated the origin of this unusual selectivity.







Abstract
Aromatic ammonium and phosphonium salts are important synthetic intermediates and multifunctional materials, but para&#8208;selective functionalization of the aromatic salts remains a challenge. Here we develop an ionic ligand based on our newly designed &#8220;biphenyl&#8208;phenanthroline&#8221; skeleton and realize the Ir&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of seven types of aromatic quaternary ammonium and phosphonium salts. Gram&#8208;scale transformation, late&#8208;stage elaboration for drug molecule, and diversification of borylated products demonstrate the potential utility of this reaction. The mechanistic studies and computational analysis elucidate the origin of para&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Strong Nonlinearity Induced by Coaxial Alignment of Polar Chain and Dense [BO3] Units in CaZn2(BO3)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new beryllium&#8208;free borate with double&#8208;layered configuration was rationally designed. It shows a large phase&#8208;matching second harmonic generation reponse, which is 38 times higher than that of its barium analogue. These findings show the great significance of using tetrahedra to design nonlinear optical crystals and also verify the feasibility of using simple non&#8208;isomorphic substitution to induce giant second&#8208;order nonlinearity enhancement.







Abstract
Discovery of new efficient nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with large second&#8208;order nonlinearity for the short&#8208;wave ultraviolet spectral region (&#955;PM&#8804;266&#8197;nm, PM=phase&#8208;matching) is still very challenging. Herein, a new beryllium&#8208;free borate CaZn2(BO3)2 with Sr2Be2B2O7 (SBBO) double&#8208;layered like configuration was rationally designed, which not only preserves the structural merits but also eliminates the limitations of the SBBO crystal. CaZn2(BO3)2 shows a large PM second harmonic generation (SHG) reponse of 3.8&#215;KDP, which is 38 times higher than that of its barium analogue. This enhancement mainly originates from the 1[Zn2O6]&#8734; polar chains with a large net dipole moment and [BO3] units with a high NLO active density. Our findings show the great significance of the [ZnO4] tetrahedra introduced strategy to design beryllium&#8208;free SBBO&#8208;type NLO crystals and also verify the feasibility of using simple non&#8208;isomorphic substitution to induce giant second&#8208;order nonlinearity enhancement.

         <title>A Glycoform&#8208;Resolved Dual&#8208;Modal Ratiometric Immunoassay Improves the Diagnostic Precision for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking both terminal sialic acid and core fucose into account, a molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs)&#8208;based dual&#8208;modal ratiometric immunoassay was developed for the precise diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Three MIPs orthogonally recognize the N&#8208;terminal epitope, C&#8208;terminal epitope and glycans of glycoprotein biomarkers, and dual&#8208;modal detection provides two independent glycans/glycoprotein values, enabling self&#8208;validating, high&#8208;contrast, and more precise diagnosis compared to antibodies&#8208;based methods.







Abstract
The glycosylation pattern of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) paves the basis for precise early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, existing analytical methods ignore the contribution of terminal sialic acid, which has been reported to be highly connected with HCC. Besides, the development of diagnostic assays is severely hindered by the preparation of anti&#8208;glycans antibodies. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), as synthetic antibody mimics, provide unique strengths to address these issues. Herein, we report a MIPs&#8208;based dual&#8208;modal ratiometric immunoassay for precise HCC diagnosis. Using a &#8220;pit one against ten&#8221; MIP to recognize a subset of glycans containing sialic acid and/or core fucose, we demonstrated our assay exhibited improved precision as compared with ELISA. This assay provided not only a glycoform&#8208;resolved method for precise HCC diagnosis, but also a new paradigm for developing antibody mimics via molecular imprinting towards challenging biomedical applications.

An isostructural series of heavy Group 14 E(I) radical anions (Ge, Sn, Pb), stabilized by a bulky diamido ligand, is reported. Comprehensive characterization of these species was achieved by using EPR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT analysis. The results obtained reveal that in all cases, the spin density of the unpaired electron resides, almost exclusively, in a p&#8208;orbital of &#960; symmetry located on the metal center itself.







Abstract
An isostructural series of heavy Group 14 E(I) radical anions (Ge, Sn, Pb), stabilized by a bulky xanthene&#8208;based diamido ligand are reported. The radical anions were synthesised by the one&#8208;electron reduction of their corresponding E(II) precursor complexes with sodium naphthalenide in THF, yielding the radical anions as charge&#8208;separated sodium salts. The series of main group radicals have been comprehensively characterized by EPR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT analysis, which reveal that in all cases, the spin density of the unpaired electron almost exclusively resides in a p&#8208;orbital of &#960; symmetry located on the Group 14 center.

         <title>Biocatalytic Asymmetric Construction of Secondary and Tertiary Fluorides from &#946;&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Ketoacids**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 21, May 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of secondary and tertiary fluorides is performed by the pyruvate aldolase HpcH and its engineered variants, utilizing &#946;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketoacids as non&#8208;native donor substrates. Rationalization of beneficial mutations and optimization of reaction conditions allowed for the chemoenzymatic preparation of fluorinated synthons with relevance to bioactive natural products and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Fluorine is a critical element for the design of bioactive compounds, driving advances in selective and sustainable fluorination. However, stereogenic tertiary fluorides pose a synthetic challenge and are thus present in only a few approved drugs (fluticasone, solithromycin, and sofosbuvir). The aldol reaction of fluorinated donors provides an atom&#8208;economical approach to asymmetric C&#8722;F motifs via C&#8722;C bond formation. We report that the type II pyruvate aldolase HpcH and engineered variants perform addition of &#946;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketoacids (including fluoropyruvate, &#946;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketobutyrate, and &#946;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketovalerate) to diverse aldehydes. The reactivity of HpcH towards these fluoro&#8208;donors grants access to enantiopure secondary or tertiary fluorides. In addition to representing the first synthesis of tertiary fluorides via biocatalytic carboligation, the afforded products could improve the diversity of fluorinated building blocks and enable the synthesis of fluorinated drug analogs.

         <title>The Raw Mixed Conducting Interphase Affords Effective Prelithiation in Working Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Contact prelithiation of working anodes from a sacrificial Li source is an important strategy to compensate the initial capacity loss of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the dead Li generated from inadequate Li source conversion (&lt;65.0%) reduces the cycling stability of batteries. Herein a mono&#8208;solvent dimethyl carbonate (DMC) electrolyte was employed in contact prelithiation for the first time. We discover that the uneven and low organic content raw electrolyte interphase (REI) induced by this electrolyte on Li source and anode has the characteristic of mixed ion/electron conductors. Therefore, the electron channels can be maintained over the prelithiation even the Li source has been completely wrapped by the DMC&#8208;derived REI. As a result, an outstanding Li source utilization of 92.8% and a negligible dead Li yield can be realized. This work affords a fresh insight into the significance of REI for effective contact prelithiation to render the batteries with very high initial Coulombic efficiency (90.0%) and an excellent capacity retention (94.9%) over 210 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>4&#8208;Aminothiophenol Photodimerization Without Plasmons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photodimerization of 4&#8208;aminothiophenol (PATP) into 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dimercaptobenzene (DMAB) has been extensively utilized as a paradigm reaction to probe the role of surface plasmons in nanoparticle&#8208;mediated light&#8208;driven processes.
Here I report the first observation of the PATP&#8208;to&#8208;DMAB photoreaction in the absence of any plasmonic mediators. The reaction was observed to occur with different kinetics either for PATP adsorbed on non plasmonic nanoparticles (TiO  2  , ZnO, SiO  2  ) or deposited as macroscopic droplets. Confocal microRaman spectroscopy enabled to investigate the reaction progress in different plasmon&#8208;free contexts, either aerobic or anaerobic, suggesting a new interpretation of the photodimerization process, based on direct laser&#8208;induced activation of singlet oxygen species. These results provide new insights in light&#8208;driven redox processes, elucidating the role of sample morphology, light and oxygen.</dc:description>

Confocal microRaman spectroscopy enabled to investigate the reaction progress in different plasmon-free contexts, either aerobic or anaerobic, suggesting a new interpretation of the photodimerization process, based on direct laser-induced activation of singlet oxygen species. These results provide new insights in light-driven redox processes, elucidating the role of sample morphology, light and oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Rotaxane&#8208;Based Multi&#8208;Modal Probes for Cancer Biomarker Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically interlocked molecules present opportunities to construct therapeutic drugs and diagnostic imaging agents but harnessing supramolecular chemistry to make biologically active probes in water is a challenge. Here, we describe a rotaxane&#8208;based approach to synthesise radiolabelled proteins and peptides for molecular imaging of cancer biomarkers  in vivo  . Host&#8208;guest chemistry using &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and curcurbit[6]uril catalysed cooperative capture synthesis produced gallium&#8208;68 or zirconium&#8208;89 radiolabelled metallo[4]rotaxanes. Photochemical conjugation to trastuzumab led to a viable positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer. The rotaxane architecture can be tuned to accommodate different radiometal ion complexes, other protein&#8208; or peptide&#8208;based drugs, and fluorophores for optical detection. This technology provides a platform to explore how mechanical bonding can improve drug delivery, enhance tumour specificity, control radiotracer pharmacokinetics, and reduce dosimetry.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Double Remote C(sp2)&#8722;H/ C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalizations by Radical Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Distal C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalizations have recently emerged as step&#8208;economical tools for molecular synthesis. However, while the C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) construction is of fundamental importance, its formation through double remote C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation has proven elusive. By merging the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization with an aliphatic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process, we, herein, describe the catalyzed twofold remote C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalizations via photo&#8208;induced ruthenium&#8208;mediated radical relay. Thus, meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H arene bonds and remote C(sp3)&#8722;H alkane bonds were activated by a single catalyst in a single operation. This process was accomplished at room temperature by visible light &#8722; notably without exogenous photocatalysts. Experimental and computational theory studies uncovered a manifold comprising ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H activation, single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (SET), 1,n&#8208;HAT (n = 5~7) and &#963;&#8208;activation by means of a single ruthenium(II) catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Parameritannin A2, a Branched Epicatechin Tetramer with Two Double Linkages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper reports the first total synthesis of parameritannin A2 (1), a branched epicatechin (EC) tetramer. The &#8220;phloroglucinol trick&#8221; was used to circumvent two synthetic issues encountered when assembling four EC units, namely, the steric constraint and the formation of the C4&#8211;C6 interflavan linkage. As a substructure of the middle EC unit, phloroglucinol enabled the single&#8208;step assembly of two EC units (top and side) through A&#8208;type linkages. The middle EC unit was constructed by conducting a newly developed three&#8208;carbon flavan annulation via a Pummerer/Friedel&#8211;Crafts cascade reaction to furnish a trimeric intermediate bearing a thio&#8208;leaving group at C4 position, which allowed the final installation of the bottom EC unit.</dc:description>

         <title>A&#8208;Site Diamine Cation Anchoring Enables Efficient Charge Transfer and Suppressed Ion Migration in Bi&#8208;based Hybrid Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the large distance or weak electronic conjugation between adjacent Bi&#8208;I octahedrons, the charge transport in the low&#8208;dimensional bismuth based hybrid perovskites is impeded and thus hinders their future developments. In this work, A&#8208;site cation engineering by monoamine BZA (benzylamine) and diamine 3&#8208;AMP (3&#8208;(aminomethyl)pyridine) has been demonstrated as an efficient strategy to regulate the corresponding activation energy of ionic migration and carrier transport capacity. Given the higher polarity of 3&#8208;AMP than BZA, producing a more efficient dielectric screening effect, it gives rise to obtaining the small exciton binding energy (50 meV) and low defect states (3.53 &#215; 109 cm&#8208;3). The reduced distance of adjacent Bi&#8208;I octahedrons by the bilateral anchoring of the 3&#8208;AMP2+ diamine cation enhances both electronic conjugation and charge transport performance. Therefore, the photodetector for (3&#8208;AMP)BiI5 SC shows a 243&#8208;fold increase in on/off ratio compared with the (BZA)3BiI6 SC.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pickering emulsions are particle&#8208;stabilized surfactant&#8208;free dispersions composed of two immiscible liquid phases, and emerge as attractive catalysis platform to surpass traditional technique barrier in some cases. In this review, we have comprehensively summarized the development and the catalysis applications of Pickering emulsions since the pioneering work in 2010. The explicit mechanism for Pickering emulsions will be initially discussed and clarified. Then, summarization is given to the design strategy of amphiphilic emulsion catalysts in two categories of intrinsic and extrinsic amphiphilicity. The progress of the unconventional catalytic reactions in Pickering emulsion is further described, especially for the polarity/solubility difference&#8208;driven phase segregation, &#8220;smart&#8221; emulsion reaction system, continuous flowing catalysis, and Pickering interfacial biocatalysis. Challenges and future trends for the development of Pickering emulsion catalysis are finally outlined.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking New Reactivities in Enzymes by Iminium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of biocatalysis in conquering challenging synthesis requires the constant input of new enzymes. Developing novel biocatalysts by absorbing catalysis modes from synthetic chemistry has yielded fruitful new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymes. Organocatalysis was originally bio&#8208;inspired, and has risen as the third pillar of asymmetric catalysis. Transferring organocatalytic reactions back to enzyme platforms is a promising approach for biocatalyst creation. Herein, we summarize the recent developments in the design of novel biocatalysts that adopt iminium catalysis, a fundamental branch in organocatalysis. By repurposing existing enzymes or constructing artificial enzymes, various biocatalysts for iminium catalysis have been created and optimized via protein engineering to promote valuable abiological transformations. The recent advances in iminium biocatalysis illustrate the power of combining chemomimetic biocatalyst design and directed evolution to generate useful new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepping Out of the Blue: From Visible to Near&#8208;IR Triggered Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light offers unique opportunities for controlling the activity of materials and bio&#8208;systems with high spatiotemporal resolution. Molecular photoswitches are chromophores that undergo reversible isomerization between different states upon irradiation with light, allowing a convenient means to control their influence over the system of interest. However, a significant limitation of classical photoswitches is the requirement to initiate the switching in one or both directions using deleterious UV light with poor tissue penetration. Red&#8208;shifted photoswitches are hence in high demand and has attracted keen recent research interest. In this Review, we highlight recent progress towards the development of visible&#8208; and NIR&#8208;activated photoswitches characterized by distinct photochromic reaction mechanisms. We hope that this review article will inspire further endeavors to this field, allowing the full potential of these tools in biotechnology and materials chemistry applications to be realized.</dc:description>

         <title>An Energy Dense, Powerful, Robust Bipolar Zinc&#8208;Ferrocene Redox Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox flow batteries (RFBs) have been recognized as a promising option for scalable and dispatchable renewable energy storage (e.g., solar and wind energy). Zinc metal represents a low cost, high capacity anode material to develop high energy density aqueous redox flow batteries. However, the energy storage applications of traditional inorganic Zn halide flow batteries are primarily plagued by the material challenges of traditional halide cathode electrolytes (e.g., bromine), including corrosion, toxicity, and severe crossover. As reported here, we have developed a bipolar Zinc&#8208;ferrocene salt compound, Zinc 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;sulfonatopropyl)ferrocene, Zn[Fc(SPr)2] (1.80 M solubility or 48.2 Ah/L charge storage capacity) &#8211; a robust, energy&#8208;dense, bipolar redox&#8208;active electrolyte material for high performance Zn organic RFBs. Using a low&#8208;cost porous Daramic membrane, the Zn[Fc(SPr)2] aqueous organic redox flow battery (AORFB) has worked in dual&#8208;flow and single&#8208;flow modes. It has manifested outstanding current, energy, and power performance, specifically operating at high current densities of up to 200 mA/cm2 and delivering an energy efficiency of up to 81.5% and a power density of up to 270.5 mW/cm2. A Zn[Fc(SPr)2] AORFB demonstrated an energy density of 20.2 Wh/L and displayed 100% capacity retention for 2000 cycles (1284 hr or 53.5 days). The Zn[Fc(SPr)2] ionic bipolar electrolyte not only offers record&#8208;setting, highly&#8208;stable, energy&#8208;dense, and the most powerful Zn&#8208;organic AORFBs to date, but it also provides a new paradigm to develop even more advanced redox materials for scalable energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Programming Receptor Clustering with DNA Probabilistic Circuits for Enhanced&#160; Natural Killer Cell&#160;Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing strategies to enhance the recognition ability of immune cells is important to the success of cell&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we report programming receptor clustering on membrane with DNA probabilistic circuits for enhanced immune cell recognition. By designing the circuit output to activate receptors for binding to adjacent receptors, we can engineer DNA probabilistic circuits for programmable regulation of receptor clustering. The generated receptor clusters show higher binding affinity to target cancer cells and improved membrane&#8208;anchoring stability compared with monomers. We demonstrate that programming receptor clustering could allow to modulate the recognition capability of natural killer cells and control natural killer cell&#8208;cancer cell interactions to promote efficient cancer cell killing. This work provides insights for precise control over cellular recognition and opens new opportunities for the development of cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>From Copper to Basic Copper Carbonate: A Reversible Conversion Cathode in Aqueous Anion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;ion batteries that use anions and cations as charge carriers represent a promising energy storage technology. However, an uncharted area is to explore transition metals as electrodes to host carbonate in conversion reactions. Here we report the reversible conversion reaction from copper to Cu  2  CO  3  (OH)  2  , where the copper electrode comprising K  2  CO  3  and KOH solid is self&#8208;sufficient with anion charge carriers. This electrode dissociates and associates K  +  ions during battery charge and discharge. The copper active mass and the anion&#8208;bearing cathode exhibit a reversible capacity of 664 mAh/g and 299 mAh/g, respectively, and relatively stable cycling in a saturated mixture electrolyte of K  2  CO  3  and KOH. The results open an avenue to use carbonate as a charge carrier for batteries to serve for the consumption and storage of CO  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Synthetic Affinity Probe Reveals Inhibitory Synapse Ultrastructure and Brain Connectivity**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short dimerized peptidic probe for high contrast visualization of inhibitory synapses in neuron cultures and brain tissue is presented. The probe can be flexibly applied both for widefield and confocal 3D volumetric synapse visualization, for inhibitory circuits mapping in tissue and for super&#8208;resolution imaging of synapses.







Abstract
Visualization of inhibitory synapses requires protocol tailoring for different sample types and imaging techniques, and usually relies on genetic manipulation or the use of antibodies that underperform in tissue immunofluorescence. Starting from an endogenous ligand of gephyrin, a universal marker of the inhibitory synapse, we developed a short peptidic binder and dimerized it, significantly increasing affinity and selectivity. We further tailored fluorophores to the binder, yielding &#8220;Sylite&#8221;&#8212;a probe with outstanding signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio that outperforms antibodies in tissue staining with rapid and efficient penetration, mitigation of staining artifacts, and simplified handling. In super&#8208;resolution microscopy Sylite precisely localizes the inhibitory synapse and enables nanoscale measurements. Sylite profiles inhibitory inputs and synapse sizes of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the midbrain and combined with complimentary tracing techniques reveals the synaptic connectivity.

         <title>Scalable Nitrate Treatment for Constructing Integrated Surface Structures to Mitigate Capacity Fading and Voltage Decay of Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable nitrate treatment for constructing surface&#8208;integrated structure was developed to mitigate capacity fading and voltage decay. A rule for building robust surface&#8208;integrated structure is also proposed. When the binding energy of the structure locates at a low level and the Bader charge of the O atoms nearest to the cationic atoms is as small as possible, an advanced Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode can be obtained.







Abstract
Capacity fading and voltage decay is one of the biggest obstacles for the practical application of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides due to the serious surface&#8208;related detrimental reactions. Herein, we develop a versatile and scalable method to construct a robust surface&#8208;integrated structure. All the designed samples deliver outstanding capacity and voltage stability, among which the Zn&#8208;treated sample possesses the best electrochemical performance. Its capacity retention is larger than 90&#8201;% after 400&#8197;cycles with a voltage decay ratio as small as 0.73&#8197;mV per cycle. What is more, the rules of surface&#8208;integrated structure with different cations in terms of capacity and voltage stability is further deciphered by combining with density function theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that to obtain advanced Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes, cations in Li&#8208;sites should firstly ensure the binding energy of the surface&#8208;integrated structure in a lower level and then provide Bader charge for the nearest O atoms as small as possible.

     alt="Scalable Nitrate Treatment for Constructing Integrated Surface Structures to Mitigate Capacity Fading and Voltage Decay of Li-Rich Layered Oxides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scalable nitrate treatment for constructing surface-integrated structure was developed to mitigate capacity fading and voltage decay. A rule for building robust surface-integrated structure is also proposed. When the binding energy of the structure locates at a low level and the Bader charge of the O atoms nearest to the cationic atoms is as small as possible, an advanced Li-rich layered oxide cathode can be obtained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capacity fading and voltage decay is one of the biggest obstacles for the practical application of Li-rich layered oxides due to the serious surface-related detrimental reactions. Herein, we develop a versatile and scalable method to construct a robust surface-integrated structure. All the designed samples deliver outstanding capacity and voltage stability, among which the Zn-treated sample possesses the best electrochemical performance. Its capacity retention is larger than 90&#8201;% after 400&#8197;cycles with a voltage decay ratio as small as 0.73&#8197;mV per cycle. What is more, the rules of surface-integrated structure with different cations in terms of capacity and voltage stability is further deciphered by combining with density function theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that to obtain advanced Li-rich layered oxide cathodes, cations in Li-sites should firstly ensure the binding energy of the surface-integrated structure in a lower level and then provide Bader charge for the nearest O atoms as small as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>1,3,2&#8208;Diazaphospholene&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cyclizations of Organohalides**

         <dc:description>
1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholenes hydrides (DAP&#8208;H) are shown as efficient catalysts for reductive radical cyclization of aryl and alkyl halides under irradiation with visible light. The pivotal DAP catalyst turnover was achieved by a DBU&#8208;assisted &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the formed DAP halide and HBpin.







Abstract
1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholenes hydrides (DAP&#8208;Hs) are highly nucleophilic organic hydrides serving as main&#8208;group catalysts for a range of attractive transformations. DAP hydrides can act as stoichiometric hydrogen atom transfer agents in radical reactions. Herein, we report a DAP&#8208;catalyzed reductive radical cyclization of a broad range of aryl and alkyl halides under mild conditions. The pivotal DAP catalyst turnover was achieved by a DBU&#8208;assisted &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the formed DAP halide and HBpin, which rapidly regenerates DAP&#8208;H. The transformation is significantly accelerated by irradiation with visible light. Mechanistic investigations indicate that visible light irradiation leads to the formation of DAP dimers, which are in equilibrium with DAP radicals and accelerate the cyclization. The direct use of (DAP)2 enabled a catalytic protocol in the absence of light.

         <title>Highly Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Methanation with Water Vapor on Single&#8208;Atom Platinum&#8208;Decorated Defective Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically active sites are designed for CO2 methanation with water by integrating defective polymeric carbon nitride with single Pt atoms. Single Pt sites, carbon nitride defects and &#8722;OH groups synergistically work for different functions to achieve high activity and selectivity for CH4 production in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 methanation with water is an important route to simultaneously address carbon neutrality and produce fuels. It is challenging to achieve high selectivity in CO2 methanation due to competing reactions. Nonetheless, aspects of the catalyst design can be controlled with meaningful effects on the catalytic outcomes. We report highly selective CO2 methanation with water vapor using a photocatalyst that integrates polymeric carbon nitride (CN) with single Pt atoms. As revealed by experimental characterization and theoretical simulations, the widely explored Pt&#8722;CN catalyst is adapted for selective CO2 methanation with our rationally designed synthetic method. The synthesis creates defects in CN along with formation of hydroxyl groups proximal to the coordinated Pt atoms. The photocatalyst exhibits high activity and carbon selectivity (99&#8201;%) for CH4 production in photocatalytic CO2 reduction with pure water. This work provides atomic scale insight into the design of photocatalysts for selective CO2 methanation.

         <title>Realizing 1,1&#8208;Dehydration of Secondary Alcohols to Carbenes: Pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ols as a Source of Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermal dehydration of secondary alcohols to carbenes and reverse back&#8208;hydration are showcased. The in situ generation of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes through the thermal 1,1&#8208;dehydration of secondary pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ol alcohols was realized and utilized for various purposes such as the synthesis of transition metal&#8208;carbene complexes. This methodology opens a door for further consideration of various secondary alcohols as sources of carbenes.







Abstract
Herein we report secondary pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ols as a source of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAAC) for the synthesis of CAAC&#8208;CuI&#8208;complexes and cyclic thiones when reacted with CuI&#8208;salts and elemental sulfur, respectively, under reductive elimination of water from the carbon(IV)&#8208;center. This result demonstrates a convenient and facile access to CAAC&#8208;based CuI&#8208;salts, which are well known catalysts for different organic transformations. It further establishes secondary alcohols to be a viable source of carbenes&#8212;realizing after 185&#8197;years Dumas&#8217; dream who tried to prepare the parent carbene (CH2) by 1,1&#8208;dehydration of methanol. Addressed is also the reactivity of water towards CAACs, which proceeds through an oxidative addition of the O&#8722;H bond to the carbon(II)&#8208;center. This emphasizes the ability of carbon&#8208;compounds to mimic the reactivity of transition&#8208;metal complexes: reversible oxidative addition and reductive elimination of the O&#8722;H bond to/from the C(II)/C(IV)&#8208;centre.

         <title>Strong Proton&#8208;Electron Coupling in &#960;&#8208;Planar Metal Complex with Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong proton&#8208;electron coupling behavior of a &#960;&#8208;planar nickel(II) complex with redox&#8208;active N,S&#8208;ligands was demonstrated using optical and electrochemical methods as well as theoretical calculations. The potential&#8208;pH diagram shows a significant shift in the acidity&#8208;dependent redox potential, which is supported by the calculated energetic stabilization of frontier orbitals by protonation.







Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) of metal complexes has been widely studied, especially in biochemistry and catalytic chemistry. Although metal complexes bearing redox&#8208;active ligands play a part in these research areas, those with &#960;&#8208;planar structure remain entirely unexplored, which are vital for future development of iono&#8208;electronics. Here, proton&#8208;electron coupling of a &#960;&#8208;planar nickel complex bearing redox&#8208;active N,S&#8208;ligands, Ni(itsq)2, was investigated by combining experimental and theoretical approaches. Strong proton&#8208;electron coupling was manifested in a large potential shift, which is twice greater than that of a typical PCET&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;planar metal complex with redox&#8208;inactive ligands, [Ni(dcpdt)2]2&#8722;. Theoretical calculations affirmed that the stabilization of frontier orbitals by protonation is greater in Ni(itsq)2 than that in [Ni(dcpdt)2]2&#8722;. These results indicate that &#960;&#8208;planar metal complexes with redox&#8208;active ligands are promising for developing novel PCET&#8208;type materials.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Cyclic&#8208;Helical Polymers with Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic polymers attract attention because of their endless structure and unique properties, which differ from the linear analogs. However, the synthesis of cyclic polymers is difficult and prohibits their functions and applications. In this study, we reported chiral cyclic Pd(II)&#8208;catalysts that initiate a living ring&#8208;expansion polymerization of isocyanides, yielding a single&#8208;handed cyclic&#8208;helical poly(phenyl isocyanide), with predictable molecular weight (M  n) and low dispersity (M  w/M  n), in good yield. Using this method, cyclic bottlebrush polymers were prepared via the grafting&#8208;onto strategy. The cyclic topology was confirmed using various spectroscopic data and atomic force microscope observation. Moreover, the cyclic polymer brushes, comprising of a one&#8208;handed helical backbone, showed interesting photoluminescence and circularly&#8208;polarized luminescence.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom alloys hold great promise for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), while the comprehensive experimental/theoretical investigations of SAAs for the NRR are still missing. Herein, PdFe  1  single&#8208;atom alloy metallene, in which the Fe single atoms are confined on Pd metallene support, is first developed as an effective and robust NRR electro catalyst, delivering the exceptional NRR performance with an NH  3  yield of 111.9 &#956;g h  &#8722;1  mg  &#8722;1  , a Faradaic efficiency of 37.8 % at &#8208;0.2 V (RHE) , as well as a long&#8208;term stability for 100 h electrolysis  .  In&#8208;depth mechanistic investigations by theoretical computations and operando X&#8208;ray absorption/Raman spectroscopy indentify Pd&#8208;coordinated Fe single atoms as active centers to enable efficient N  2  activation via N  2  &#8208;to&#8208;Fe &#963;&#8208;donation, reduced protonation energy barriers, suppressed hydrogen evolution and excellent thermodynamic stability, thus accounting for the high activity, selectivity and stability of PdFe  1  for the NRR.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge Separation by Creating Band Bending in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Improved Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been intensively studied as a class of semiconductor&#8208;like materials in photocatalysis. However, band bending, which plays a crucial role in semiconductor photocatalysis, has not yet been demonstrated in MOF photocatalysts. Herein, a representative MOF, MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2, is integrated with metal oxides (MoO3  and V2O5) that feature appropriate work function and energy level to afford the corresponding MOF composites. Surface photovoltage results demonstrate band bending in the MOF composites, which gives rise to the built&#8208;in electric field of MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2, boosting the charge separation. As a result, the MOF composites present 56 and 42 times higher activity, respectively, compared to the pristine MOF for photocatalytic H2  production. Upon depositing Pt onto the MOF, ~6 times higher activity is achieved. This work illustrates band bending of MOFs for the first time, supporting their semiconductor&#8208;like nature, which would greatly promote MOF photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Organic Electroluminescent Material with Very High Color Purity and Efficiency Based on Polycyclization of Multiple Resonance Parent Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds have set off an upsurge of research because of their tremendous application prospect in the field of wide color gamut display. Herein, we propose a novel MR&#8208;TADF molecular construction paradigm based on polycyclization of multiple resonance parent core, and construct a representative multiple resonance polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (MR&#8208;PAH) based on para&#8208;alignment boron and nitrogen atoms into six&#8208;membered ring (p&#8208;BNR). Through the retrosynthesis analysis, a concise synthesis strategy with wide applicability has been proposed, encompassing programmed sequential boron esterification, Suzuki coupling and Scholl oxidative coupling. The target model molecule BN&#8208;TP shows green fluorescence with emission peak at 523 nm and narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 34 nm. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) employing BN&#8208;TP as an emitter exhibits ultrapure green emission with Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.70), and achieves maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 35.1%.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Hollow Zinc Oxide Nanocomposites derived from Morphology&#8208;tunable Coordination Polymers for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the flexible producer of substrates, it is of increasing importance to create the infinite coordination&#8208;polymer particles (CPPs) for high&#8208;efficiency solar energy conversion. However, the inadequate advanced organic ligands and modification largely hinder their application. In this work, competitive evolution&#8212;morphological and structural change from Zn&#8208;based crystallites to amorphous particles is achieved. The controllable contribution of organic linkers selectively derived six Zn&#8208;CPPs with multivariate characters. Based on the diversity of these substructures, hollow zinc oxide particles were initially formed by self&#8208;pyrolysis of CPPs and effectively modified by ultrathin doped&#8208;nanosheets. Especially, the obtained double&#8208;sided heterojunctions show advantages of fully&#8208;covered active sites, bringing together the efficient light&#8208;excited charge transfer nanochannels, which exhibit an excellent solar H2  releasing activity (e.g., 4512.5 &#956;mol h&#8208;1  g&#8208;1  ) and stable cyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Janus Nickel Sites on Red Phosphorus for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom nickel catalysts hold great promise for photocatalytic water splitting due to their plentiful active sites and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, we adopt a reactive&#8208;group guided strategy to prepare atomically dispersed nickel catalysts on red phosphorus. The hydrothermal treatment of red phosphorus leads to the formation of P&#8208;H and P&#8208;OH groups, which behave as the reactive functionalities to generate the dual structure of single&#8208;atom P&#8208;Ni and P&#8208;O&#8208;Ni catalytic sites. The produced single&#8208;atom sites provide two different functions: P&#8208;Ni for water reduction and P&#8208;O&#8208;Ni for water oxidation. Benefitting from this specific Janus structure, Ni&#8208;red phosphorus shows an elevated hydrogen evolution rate compared to Ni nanoparticle&#8208;modified red phosphorus under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The hydrogen evolution rate was additionally enhanced with increased reaction temperature, reaching 91.51 &#956;mol h  &#8208;1  at 70 &#176;C, corresponding to an apparent quantum efficiency of 8.9 % at 420 nm excitation wavelength.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single-atom nickel catalysts hold great promise for photocatalytic water splitting due to their plentiful active sites and cost-effectiveness. Herein, we adopt a reactive-group guided strategy to prepare atomically dispersed nickel catalysts on red phosphorus. The hydrothermal treatment of red phosphorus leads to the formation of P-H and P-OH groups, which behave as the reactive functionalities to generate the dual structure of single-atom P-Ni and P-O-Ni catalytic sites. The produced single-atom sites provide two different functions: P-Ni for water reduction and P-O-Ni for water oxidation. Benefitting from this specific Janus structure, Ni-red phosphorus shows an elevated hydrogen evolution rate compared to Ni nanoparticle-modified red phosphorus under visible-light irradiation. The hydrogen evolution rate was additionally enhanced with increased reaction temperature, reaching 91.51 &#956;mol h  -1  at 70 &#176;C, corresponding to an apparent quantum efficiency of 8.9 % at 420 nm excitation wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Odorant Metabolism in Humans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Odorants are relatively small molecules which are easily taken up and distributed in the human body. Despite their relevance in everyday life, however, only a limited amount of evidence about their metabolism, pathways, and bioactivities in the human body exists. With this review, we aim to encourage future interdisciplinary research on the function and mechanisms of the biotransformation of odorants, involving different disciplines such as nutrition, medicine, biochemistry, chemistry, and sensory sciences. Starting with a general overview of the different ways of odorant uptake and enzymes involved in the metabolism of odorants, a more precise description of biotransformation processes and their function in the oral cavity, the nose, the lower respiratory tract (LRT), and the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is given together with an overview of the different routes of odorant excretion. Finally, perspectives for future research are discussed.</dc:description>

Hydrophobicity is important, but subtle changes in electrostatic surface potential, dipoles and polarizability also enhance association with phospholipid membranes and cell uptake. A combination of fluorine and sulfur substituents on an aromatic ring induces microdipoles that enhance&#160;cell uptake of 12&#8208;residue peptide inhibitors of p53&#8208;HDM2 interaction and of cell&#8208;penetrating cyclic peptides.

         <title>Cobalt Single Atoms Anchored on Oxygen&#8208;Doped Tubular Carbon Nitride for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation: Simultaneous Coordination Structure and Morphology Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneous regulation of the coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts and engineering architectures with efficient exposed active sites   are efficient strategies for boosting peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation.   We isolated  cobalt atoms with dual nitrogen and oxygen coordination (Co&#8208;N  3  O  1  ) on oxygen&#8208;doped tubular carbon nitride (TCN) by pyrolyzing a hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyanuric acid melamine&#8211;cobalt acetate precursor. The theoretically constructed Co&#8208;N  3  O  1  moiety on TCN exhibited an impressive mass activity of 7.61&#215;105 min  &#8722;1  mol  &#8722;1  with high  1  O  2  selectivity. Theoretical calculations revealed that the cobalt single atoms occupied a dual nitrogen and oxygen coordination environment, and that PMS adsorption was promoted and energy barriers reduced for the key *O intermediate that produced  1  O  2  . The catalysts were attached to a widely used poly(vinylidene fluoride) microfiltration membrane to deliver an antibiotic wastewater treatment system with 97.5% ciprofloxacin rejection over 10 hours, thereby revealing the suitability of the membrane for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Small&#8208;Molecule Metal&#8208;Carrying Prochelator: A Novel Prodrug Design Strategy for Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective activation of prodrugs is an important approach to reduce the side effects of disease treatment. We report a prodrug design concept for metal complexes, termed &#8220;metal&#8208;carrying prochelator&#8221;, which can co&#8208;carry a metal ion and chelator within a single small&#8208;molecule compound   and remain inert until it undergoes a specifically triggered intramolecular chelation to synthesize a bioactive metal complex  in situ  for targeted therapy  . As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we designed a H  2  O  2  &#8208;responsive small&#8208;molecule prochelator, DPBD, based on the strong chelator diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC) and copper. DPBD can carry Cu  2+  (DPBD&#8208;Cu) and respond to elevated H  2  O  2  levels in tumor cells by releasing DTC, which rapidly chelates Cu  2+  from DPBD&#8208;Cu affording a DTC&#8208;copper complex with high cytotoxicity, realizing potent antitumor efficacy with low systemic toxicity. Thus, with its unique intramolecularly triggered activation mechanism, this concept based on a small&#8208;molecule metal&#8208;carrying prochelator  can help in the prodrug design of metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>SrZnGeS4: A Dual&#8208;Waveband Nonlinear&#160;Material With A Transparency Spanning UV&#8211;Vis and Far&#8208;IR Spectral Regions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;linear optical chalcogenides with a wide band gap (Eg) and excellent NLO properties are key materials for highly desirable multiwaveband tunable optical parametric oscillators (OPOs). We exploit the &#8220;electronic structure engineer bucket effect&#8221; to develop a novel dual&#8208;waveband SrZnGeS4 with an ultrawide transparency window. It exhibits an asymmetric Fdd2 structure that consists of layers formed by corner&#8208;sharing [ZnGeS6] dimers. SrZnGeS4 is transparent from 0.30 to 23.6 &#956;m, spanning the UV&#8208;, vis&#8208;, mid&#8208; and far&#8208;IR spectral regions and has the widest Eg (3.63 eV) in the AeMIIMIVQ4 family to date. It exhibits phase matching, high SHG intensities (e.g., 11.0 &#215; KDP and 17.5 &#215; AGS under &#955;inc = 1450 and 950 nm, respectively), and a very high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (35 &#215; AGS). These results not only suggest bright prospects for high&#8208;power laser applications but may also enable applications of the multiwaveband OPO system from the UV&#8211;visible to far&#8208;IR regions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a formal carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8211;C) bond insertion via the reaction of secondary benzylic halides (fluorides, chlorides, and bromides) with &#945;&#8208;diazo esters catalyzed by Lewis acid catalysts. Secondary benzylic halides underwent elongation to afford &#945;,&#946;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;haloesters diastereoselectively. Density functional theory calculation revealed that the present formal C&#8211;C bond insertion was the result of Lewis acid&#8208;promoted cleavage and the re&#8208;formation of a carbon&#8211;halogen bond and that the aryl&#8208;migration step determined the diastereoselectivity. Various diarylmethyl halides and &#945;&#8208;diazo esters were applicable to this reaction system. In addition, ring expansion in cyclic benzylic chlorides was accomplished.</dc:description>

         <title>A Valence&#8208;Engineered Self&#8208;Cascading Antioxidant Nanozyme for the Therapy of Inflammatory Bowel Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A valence&#8208;engineered strategy to develop self&#8208;cascading nanozymes with simultaneous multiple antioxidant activities has been proposed. Nanozyme LiMn2O4 (LM), as the final optimized material, exhibits the best SOD&#8208;like, CAT&#8208;like, GPx&#8208;like, and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities. The outstanding antioxidant capacity of LM was demonstrated at the cellular level and in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in mice.







Abstract
Antioxidant treatment strategy by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a highly effective disease treatment option. Nanozymes with multiple antioxidant activities can cope with the diverse ROS environment. However, lack of design strategies and limitation of negative correlation for nanozymes with multiple antioxidant activities hindered their development. To overcome these difficulties, here we used ZnMn2O4 as a model to explore the role of Mn valency at the octahedral site via a valence&#8208;engineered strategy, and found that its multiple antioxidant activities are positively correlated with the content of Mn4+. Therefore, through this strategy, a self&#8208;cascading antioxidant nanozyme LiMn2O4 was constructed, and its efficacy was verified at the cellular level and in an inflammatory bowel disease model. This work not only provides guidance for the design of multiple antioxidant nanozymes, but also broadens the biomedical application potential of multiple antioxidant nanozymes.

         <title>Introducing 4s&#8211;2p Orbital Hybridization to Stabilize Spinel Oxide Cathodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong molecular bonding formed by Ge 4s and O 2p orbitals contributes to a robust and endurable metal&#8211;oxygen framework of the spinel oxide structure, which is not achievable via common 3d&#8211;2p orbital hybridization alone, making the oxide cathodes exhibit extraordinarily stable electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Oxides composed of an oxygen framework and interstitial cations are promising cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the instability of the oxygen framework under harsh operating conditions results in fast battery capacity decay, due to the weak orbital interactions between cations and oxygen (mainly 3d&#8211;2p interaction). Here, a robust and endurable oxygen framework is created by introducing strong 4s&#8211;2p orbital hybridization into the structure using LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 oxide as an example. The modified oxide delivers extraordinarily stable battery performance, achieving 71.4&#8201;% capacity retention after 2000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. This work shows that an orbital&#8208;level understanding can be leveraged to engineer high structural stability of the anion oxygen framework of oxides. Moreover, the similarity of the oxygen lattice between oxide electrodes makes this approach extendable to other electrodes, with orbital&#8208;focused engineering a new avenue for the fundamental modification of battery materials.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallic as a Highly Active and Selective Catalyst for Acetylene Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;metallization of intermetallic NiGa formed high&#8208;entropy intermetallcis represented as (NiFeCu)(GaGe), which worked as a highly active and selective catalyst for acetylene semihydrogenation. Overhydrogenation of ethylene was completely inhibited even at complete conversion of acetylene. Moreover, the specific activity was at least five times higher than those in reported systems using selective Ni&#8208; and Cu&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Acetylene semihydrogenation is a key technology for producing polymer&#8208;grade ethylene from crude ethylene. Ni&#8208;based catalysts are promising alternatives to noble&#8208;metals for this process. However, achieving high catalytic activity and selectivity remains a big challenge. We report a novel catalyst design based on high&#8208;entropy intermetallics (HEI), which provide thermally stable isolated Ni without excess counterpart metals and achieve exceptionally high performance. Intermetallic NiGa was multi&#8208;metalized to a (NiFeCu)(GaGe), where the Ni and Ga sites were partially substituted with Fe/Cu and Ge, respectively, without altering the parent CsCl&#8208;type structure. The NiFeCuGaGe/SiO2 HEI catalyst completely inhibited ethylene overhydrogenation even at complete acetylene conversion, and exhibited five&#8208;times higher activity than other 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts. The DFT study showed that the surface energy decreased by multi&#8208;metallization, which drastically weakened ethylene adsorption.

         <title>Stereodefined Skipped Dienes through Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Formal Addition of Tertiary Allylic C&#8722;H Bonds to Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed formal addition of allylic C&#8722;H bond to alkyne is reported. A tertiary C&#8722;H bond was cleaved at the site of which a quaternary carbon center was formed. This atom&#8208;economical process provided a straightforward synthetic route to skipped dienes containing a C3&#8208;quaternary carbon. Enantioselective construction of acyclic quaternary carbon stereocenters through enantio&#8208;convergent vinylation of tertiary C&#8722;H bond was also feasible.







Abstract
Preparation of skipped dienes with a quaternary carbon center at the C&#8208;3 position remains a synthetic challenge. We report here an iridium&#8208;catalyzed formal addition of tertiary sp3 C&#8722;H bond to alkyne for the facile preparation of skipped dienes. The tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bond is cleaved regioselectively, at the site of which a new C&#8722;C bond is formed. Enantioselective construction of acyclic quaternary carbon stereocenters is also demonstrated.

         <title>Mapping Active Site Geometry to Activity in Immobilized Frustrated Lewis Pair Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A many&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic performance of frustrated Lewis pairs is attainable through judicious control of the spatial arrangement of the acid and base components. This is demonstrated for CO2 hydrogenation by mapping the active site geometry to catalyst activity and identifying the optimal distance and orientation of the donor&#8211;acceptor centers using nonlinear scaling relationships.







Abstract
The immobilization of molecular catalysts imposes spatial constraints on their active site. We reveal that in bifunctional catalysis such constraints can also be utilized as an appealing handle to boost intrinsic activity through judicious control of the active site geometry. To demonstrate this, we develop a pragmatic approach, based on nonlinear scaling relationships, to map the spatial arrangements of the acid&#8211;base components of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) to their performance in the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. The resulting activity map shows that fixing the donor&#8211;acceptor centers at specific distances and locking them into appropriate orientations leads to an unforeseen many&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic activity of FLPs compared to their unconstrained counterparts.

         <title>Persistent Ambipolar Heptacenes and Their Redox Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble heptacenes are stabilized via TIPS&#8208;ethynylation and halogenation. TIPS&#8208;ethynylation on every second ring is critical for longevity. The most stable derivative is characterized in thin&#8208;film transistors and post&#8208;functionalized via Stille coupling to a nonarene.







Abstract
Sixfold TIPS&#8208;ethynylation combined with fourfold bromination of the armchair edges furnishes a long&#8208;lived, soluble heptacene; &#960;&#8208;extension via Stille coupling accesses a persistent tetrabenzononacene. Both types of acenes were stabilized best by double TIPS&#8208;ethynylation on every other benzene ring. Tetrabromoheptacene is an ambipolar transistor material (up to 0.036&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 n&#8208;channel), which was corroborated by generation of its monoanion and monocation.

         <dc:description>
The dynamic interactions between RNA and proteins play crucial roles in regulating diverse cellular processes. Proteome&#8208;wide characterization of these interactions in their native cellular context remains desirable but challenging. A photocatalytic crosslinking (PhotoCAX) strategy for studying the composition and dynamics of protein&#8211;RNA interactions via mass spectrometry (PhotoCAX&#8208;MS) as well as RNA sequencing (PhotoCAX&#8208;seq) is reported.

         <title>Correlative Electrochemical Microscopy for the Elucidation of the Local Ionic and Electronic Properties of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining feedback (FB) and multi&#8208;frequency alternating&#8208;current (AC) SECM methodologies is proposed as a unique approach that provides the two essential properties namely the ionic and electronic conductivity of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in Li&#8208;ion batteries quantitatively. The influence of the electrolyte composition and the SEI formation protocol on the properties of the resulting SEI was derived.







Abstract
The solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a key role in the stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries as the SEI prevents the continuous degradation of the electrolyte at the anode. The SEI acts as an insulating layer for electron transfer, still allowing the ionic flux through the layer. We combine the feedback and multi&#8208;frequency alternating&#8208;current modes of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for the first time to assess quantitatively the local electronic and ionic properties of the SEI varying the SEI formation conditions and the used electrolytes in the field of Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIB). Correlations between the electronic and ionic properties of the resulting SEI on a model Cu electrode demonstrates the unique feasibility of the proposed strategy to provide the two essential properties of an SEI: ionic and electronic conductivity in dependence on the formation conditions, which is anticipated to exhibit a significant impact on the field of LIBs.

         <title>Synergy in Au&#8722;CuO Janus Structure for Catalytic Isopropanol Oxidative Dehydrogenation to Acetone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique Au&#8722;CuO Janus structure with a 0.5&#8197;nm ultrathin CuO layer was developed. The Au&#8722;CuO interfacial structure was confirmed to be extremely efficient for C&#8722;H activation; a dramatic decrease of the &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond scission energy barrier from 1.44 to 0.01&#8197;eV due to the strong affinity between the O of CuO and H of isopropanol, compared with Au sites alone.







Abstract
The controlled oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding ketones or aldehydes via selective cleavage of the &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of alcohols under mild conditions still remains a significant challenge. Although the metal/oxide interface is highly active and selective, the interfacial sites fall far behind the demand, due to the large and thick support. Herein, we successfully develop a unique Au&#8722;CuO Janus structure (average particle size=3.8&#8197;nm) with an ultrathin CuO layer (0.5&#8197;nm thickness) via a bimetal in situ activation and separation strategy. The resulting Au&#8722;CuO interfacial sites prominently enhance isopropanol adsorption and decrease the energy barrier of &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond scission from 1.44 to 0.01&#8197;eV due to the strong affinity between the O atom of CuO and the H atom of isopropanol, compared with Au sites alone, thereby achieving ultrahigh acetone selectivity (99.3&#8201;%) over 1.1&#8197;wt&#8201;% AuCu0.75/Al2O3 at 100&#8201;&#176;C and atmospheric pressure with 97.5&#8201;% isopropanol conversion. Furthermore, Au&#8722;CuO Janus structures supported on SiO2, TiO2 or CeO2 exhibit remarkable catalytic performance, and great promotion in activity and acetone selectivity is achieved as well for other reducible oxides derived from Fe, Co, Ni and Mn. This study should help to develop strategies for maximized interfacial site construction and structure optimization for efficient &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond activation.

         <title>Electronically Engineering Water Resistance in Methane Combustion with an Atomically Dispersed Tungsten on PdO Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane combustion generates less CO2 emissions than coal and oil, making it a cleaner alternative to other fossil fuels. A PdW1/Al2O3 single&#8208;atom catalyst shows enhanced H2O&#8208;resistance during CH4 combustion. The results show that catalytic CH4 combustion involves water and proceeds via a hydroperoxyl&#8208;promoted reaction on the catalyst surface. An upshift of the d&#8208;band center of Pd aids the adsorption and activation of oxygen on the catalyst.







Abstract
Improving the low&#8208;temperature water&#8208;resistance of methane combustion catalysts is of importance for industrial applications and it is challenging. A stepwise strategy is presented for the preparation of atomically dispersed tungsten species at the catalytically active site (Pd nanoparticles). After an activation process, a Pd&#8722;O&#8722;W1&#8208;like nanocompound is formed on the PdO surface with an atomic scale interface. The resulting supported catalyst has much better water resistance than the conventional catalysts for methane combustion. The integrated characterization results confirm that catalytic combustion of methane involves water, proceeding via a hydroperoxyl&#8208;promoted reaction mechanism on the catalyst surface. The results of density functional theory calculations indicate an upshift of the d&#8208;band center of palladium caused by electron transfer from atomically dispersed tungsten, which greatly facilitates the adsorption and activation of oxygen on the catalyst.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Catalyzed Copper&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Sulfonylation of Benzaldehydes via a Transient Imine Directing Group**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient C&#8722;H sulfonylation of benzaldehydes is achieved using copper and catalytic &#946;&#8208;alanine to form a directing group in situ. Aldehydes and sulfinate salts are coupled in a single step in high yields. Kinetic and mechanistic investigations are presented, with insights to the C&#8722;H activation step.







Abstract
Transient directing groups (TDGs) can provide a powerful means for C&#8722;H functionalization without requiring additional steps for directing group introduction and removal. We report the first use of a TDG in combination with copper to effect C&#8722;H functionalization. The regioselective copper mediated &#946;&#8722;C(sp2)&#8722;H sulfonylation of aldehydes with sulfinate salts is accomplished using catalytic &#946;&#8208;alanine to form a transient imine. A broad range of sulfonylated benzaldehydes are prepared using copper fluoride as both copper source and oxidant, involving a [5,6] cupracyclic intermediate. &#947;&#8208;(peri)&#8208;Sulfonylation of napthyl and phenanthrenyl carboxaldehydes is achieved through [6,6] cupracyclic intermediates. Further derivatisation of the aldehyde products is demonstrated. Kinetic experiments and Hammett analysis suggest the turnover limiting step to be a concerted asynchronous C&#8722;H cleavage via a dearomative Wheland&#8208;type transition state.

         <title>Enhancing Metalating Efficiency of the Sodium Amide NaTMP in Arene Borylation Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;nucleophilic amide NaTMP, in combination with PMDETA and B(OiPr)3 have allowed the deprotonative borylation of unactivated arenes under mild conditions. The study of its reaction pathway and the characterisation of the intermediates by X&#8208;Ray crystallography and 1H DOSY enabled the development of this protocol, which forms boronates in a direct and easy way, enabling Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings to obtain biaryls in an efficient manner.







Abstract
Though LiTMP (TMP=2,2&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide) is a commonly used amide, surprisingly the heavier NaTMP has hardly been utilised. Here, by mixing NaTMP with tridentate donor PMDETA (N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine), we provide structural, and mechanistic insights into the sodiation of non&#8208;activated arenes (e.g. anisole and benzene). While these reactions are low yielding, adding B(OiPr)3 has a profound effect, not only by intercepting the CAr&#8208;Na bond, but also by driving the metalation reaction towards quantitative formation of more stabilized sodium aryl boronates. Demonstrating its metalating power, regioselective C2&#8208;metalation/borylation of naphthalene has been accomplished contrasting with single&#8208;metal based protocols which are unselective and low yielding. Extension to other arenes allows for in situ generation of aryl boronates which can then directly engage in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings, furnishing a range of biaryls in a selective and efficient manner.

         <title>Sulfone&#8208;Decorated Conjugated Organic Polymers Activate Oxygen for Photocatalytic Methane Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a process of methane conversion photocatalyzed by the sulfone&#8208;decorated conjugated organic polymer, S&#8208;CTTP, light irradiation first induced the homolytic dissociation of S=O bonds in sulfone groups on the catalyst surface to generate free radicals. The radicals drive efficient conversion of 1O2 to H2O2 and then &#8901;OH, for oxidation of adsorbed CH4 into CH3OH and HCOOH selectively.







Abstract
Oxidizing CH4 into liquid products with O2 under mild conditions still mainly relies on metal catalysis. We prepared a series of sulfone&#8208;modified conjugated organic polymers and found that the catalyst with proper SVI content (0.10) could drive O2&#8594;H2O2&#8594;&#8901;OH to oxidize CH4 into CH3OH and HCOOH directly and efficiently at room temperature under light irradiation. Experimental results showed that after 4&#8197;h reaction, decomposition rate and residual amounts of H2O2 were 81.21&#8201;% and 4.83&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 respectively, and CH4 conversion rate was 22.81&#8201;%. Mechanism studies revealed that illumination could induce the homolytic dissociation of S=O bonds on catalyst to produce oxygen and sulfur radicals, where the &#8901;O could adsorb and activate CH4, and the &#8901;S could supply electrons for 1O2 to generate H2O2 and then for decomposing the H2O2 into &#8901;OH timely to oxidize CH4. This research provided a novel organic catalysis approach for oxygen activation and utilization.

         <title>Interfacial Polymetallic Oxides and Hierarchical Porous Core&#8211;Shell Fibres for High Energy&#8208;Density Electrochemical Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hetero&#8208;structured polymetallic oxides/porous graphene core&#8211;sheath fibres are demonstrated as high&#8208;performance electrochemical supercapacitor electrodes via a microchannel self&#8208;assembly method. Because of rich micro&#8208;/mesoporous ionic pathways, a large accessible surface, high Faradaic activity and excellent interface electron conduction, the supercapacitors display remarkable areal capacitance, energy&#8208;density, long&#8208;life cycles and actual applications.







Abstract
Realizing high energy&#8208;density and actual applications of fibre&#8208;based electrochemical supercapacitors (FESCs) are pivotal but challenging, as the ability to construct advanced fibres for accelerating charges kinetic diffusion and Faradaic storage remain key bottlenecks. Here, we demonstrate high&#8208;performance FESCs based on hetero&#8208;structured polymetallic oxides/porous graphene core&#8211;sheath fibres, where the large pseudo&#8208;active polymetallic oxide (PMO) sheath is uniformly loaded on a hierarchical porous graphene fibre (PGF) core. Due to the abundant micro&#8208;/mesoporous pathways, large accessible surface, excellent redox activity and good interface electron conduction, the PMO&#8208;PGF possesses high areal capacitance (2959.78&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and manageable Faradaic reversibility in a 6&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the PMO&#8208;PGF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state FESCs present high energy&#8208;density (187.22&#8197;&#956;&#8201;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), long&#8208;life cycles (95.8&#8201;% capacitive retention after 20&#8201;000&#8197;cycles), diverse&#8208;powered capabilities and actual energy&#8208;supply applications.

&lt;p&gt;Hetero-structured polymetallic oxides/porous graphene core&#8211;sheath fibres are demonstrated as high-performance electrochemical supercapacitor electrodes via a microchannel self-assembly method. Because of rich micro-/mesoporous ionic pathways, a large accessible surface, high Faradaic activity and excellent interface electron conduction, the supercapacitors display remarkable areal capacitance, energy-density, long-life cycles and actual applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing high energy-density and actual applications of fibre-based electrochemical supercapacitors (FESCs) are pivotal but challenging, as the ability to construct advanced fibres for accelerating charges kinetic diffusion and Faradaic storage remain key bottlenecks. Here, we demonstrate high-performance FESCs based on hetero-structured polymetallic oxides/porous graphene core&#8211;sheath fibres, where the large pseudo-active polymetallic oxide (PMO) sheath is uniformly loaded on a hierarchical porous graphene fibre (PGF) core. Due to the abundant micro-/mesoporous pathways, large accessible surface, excellent redox activity and good interface electron conduction, the PMO-PGF possesses high areal capacitance (2959.78&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and manageable Faradaic reversibility in a 6&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the PMO-PGF-based solid-state FESCs present high energy-density (187.22&#8197;&#956;&#8201;Wh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), long-life cycles (95.8&#8201;% capacitive retention after 20&#8201;000&#8197;cycles), diverse-powered capabilities and actual energy-supply applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks and Their Derivatives via Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and green mechanochemistry was performed to realize the reticular synthesis of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks with predictable structures. Moreover, a series of Pd@HOF composites were generated by the one&#8208;pot mechanosynthesis, which showed different catalytic activities for CO oxidation. The synergetic effect between Pd and HOF was revealed by in situ DRIFTS, proving the application potential of functionalized HOF&#8208;composites.







Abstract
Rational synthesis of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with predicted structure has been a long&#8208;term challenge. Herein, by using the efficient, simple, low&#8208;cost, and scalable mechanosynthesis, we demonstrate that reticular chemistry is applicable to HOF assemblies based on building blocks with different geometry, connectivity, and functionality. The obtained crystalline HOFs show uniform nano&#8208;sized morphology, which is challenging or unachievable for conventional solution&#8208;based methods. Furthermore, the one&#8208;pot mechanosynthesis generated a series of Pd@HOF composites with noticeably different CO oxidation activities. In situ DRIFTS studies indicate that the most efficient composite, counterintuitively, shows the weakest CO affinity to Pd sites while the strongest CO affinity to HOF matrix, revealing the vital role of porous matrix to the catalytic performance. This work paves a new avenue for rational synthesis of HOF and HOF&#8208;based composites for broad application potential.

         <title>Theory&#8208;Guided Regulation of FeN4 Spin State by Neighboring Cu Atoms for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis in Flexible Metal&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
First&#8208;principles calculations show a nearly linear correlation of the energy barriers of critical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) steps with the Fe magnetic moment of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C composites. This is indeed observed when single Cu sites are incorporated into Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C aerogels, where the interactions between adjacent Fe&#8722;Cu 3d electrons result in a reduced magnetic moment of the Fe center and hence enhanced ORR activity.







Abstract
Iron, nitrogen&#8208;codoped carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) nanocomposites have emerged as viable electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the formation of FeNxCy coordination moieties. In this study, results from first&#8208;principles calculations show a nearly linear correlation of the energy barriers of key reaction steps with the Fe magnetic moment. Experimentally, when single Cu sites are incorporated into Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C aerogels (denoted as NCAG/Fe&#8722;Cu), the Fe centers exhibit a reduced magnetic moment and markedly enhanced ORR activity within a wide pH range of 0&#8211;14. With the NCAG/Fe&#8722;Cu nanocomposites used as the cathode catalyst in a neutral/quasi&#8208;solid aluminum&#8211;air and alkaline/quasi&#8208;solid zinc&#8211;air battery, both achieve a remarkable performance with an ultrahigh open&#8208;circuit voltage of 2.00 and 1.51&#8197;V, large power density of 130 and 186&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and good mechanical flexibility, all markedly better than those with commercial Pt/C or Pt/C&#8208;RuO2 catalysts at the cathode.

         <title>Dewar Metallabenzenes from Reactions of Metallacyclobutadienes with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Dewar benzene derivative was obtained over 60&#8197;years ago. The first hetero Dewar benzene with a p&#8208;block element (a 2&#8208;Dewar pyridine) was reported 45&#8197;years ago. The first examples of structurally characterized Dewar metallabenzenes via unprecedented reactions of metallacyclobutadienes with aminoalkynes have now been successfully prepared.







Abstract
Dewar benzenes, the metastable valence isomers of benzenes, have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. In contrast, little is known about Dewar metallabenzenes having a transition metal in the skeletal framework, despite the recent intensive interest in the development of chemistry of metallabenzenes. Herein, we report the isolation and characterization of the first examples of structurally characterized Dewar metallabenzenes. These compounds were generated via unprecedented reactions of metallacyclobutadienes with aminoalkynes.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Ligand&#8208;Controlled Remote para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Activation and Borylation of Twisted Aromatic Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of aromatic amides is reported. The para borylation proceeds via an unprecedented substrate&#8211;ligand distortion between the twisted aromatic amides and a newly designed ligand framework (defa), which is different from the standard borylation ligand. A new type of catalytic system was developed by using this defa ligand that demonstrated excellent levels of para selectivity for a range of aromatic amides.







Abstract
A method of para&#8208;selective borylation of aromatic amides is described. The borylation proceeded via an unprecedented substrate&#8211;ligand distortion between the twisted aromatic amides and a newly designed ligand framework (defa) that is different from the traditionally used ligand (dtbpy) for the C&#8722;H borylation reactions. The designed ligand framework (defa) has led to the development of a new type of catalytic system that shows excellent para selectivity for a range of aromatic amides. Moreover, the designed ligand has shown excellent reactivity and selectivity for a range of heterocyclic aromatic amides. The identification of key transition states and intermediates using the DFT computations associated with the three regio&#8208;isomeric pathways revealed that the most efficient catalytic pathway with the defa ligand leads to the para borylation while in the case of bpy the borylation at the para and meta sites compete.

         <title>A Hybrid Supramolecular Polymeric Nanomedicine for Cascade&#8208;Amplified Synergetic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid supramolecular polymeric nanomedicine for cascade&#8208;amplified synergetic chemodynamic therapy and chemotherapy is constructed based on &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin/camptothecin host&#8722;guest molecular recognition and iron&#8208;carboxylate coordination. In synergy with a checkpoint blockade, this supramolecular nanomedicine leads to an enhanced therapeutic performance and long&#8208;term tumor remission.







Abstract
Supramolecular nanomedicines have shown great merits in cancer therapy, but their clinical translation is hampered by monotonous therapeutic modality and unsatisfactory antitumor performance. Herein, a hybrid supramolecular polymeric nanomedicine (SNPs) is developed based on &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin/camptothecin (CPT) host&#8722;guest molecular recognition and iron&#8208;carboxylate coordination. Iron ions stabilizing SNPs catalyze the conversion of intracellular hydrogen peroxide into highly toxic hydroxyl radical through a Fenton reaction, which further cleaves the thioketal linker of the supramolecular monomer to release potent CPT, thus amplifying the therapeutic efficacy by combining chemodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. The combination therapy stimulates antitumor immunity and promotes intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes by triggering immunogenic cell death. In synergy with PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade, SNPs enables enhanced immune therapy and a long&#8208;term tumor remission.

         <title>Metal Halide Perovskite Based Heterojunction Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in constructing photocatalysts based on metal halide perovskite (MHP) heterojunctions, including Schottky, type&#8197;II, and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, which show improved carrier separation and accelerated surface reaction rates for efficient solar energy conversion are discussed systematically in this Review. Techniques for identifying the type of active heterojunctions are also evaluated and challenges and future directions highlighted.







Abstract
With fascinating photophysical properties and a strong potential to utilize solar energy, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have become a prominent feature within photocatalysis research. However, the effectiveness of single MHP photocatalysts is relatively poor. The introduction of a second component to form a heterojunction represents a well&#8208;established route to accelerate carrier migration and boost reaction rates, thus increasing the photoactivity. Recently, there have been several scientific advances related to the design of MHP&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysts, including Schottky, type&#8197;II, and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. In this Review, we systematically discuss and critically appraise recent developments in MHP&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysis. In addition, the techniques for identifying the type of active heterojunctions are evaluated and we conclude by briefly outlining the ongoing challenges and future directions for promising photocatalysts based on MHP heterojunctions.

Successful synthesis of 1,4,5,8,9,12&#8208;hexaazatriphenylene (HAT)&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks of M3(HAT)2, (M=Fe, Ni, Co) by means of an on&#8208;surface self&#8208;assembly protocol which effectively overcomes the strong inter&#8208;molecular steric hindrance.







Abstract
1,4,5,8,9,12&#8208;Hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) is one of the smallest polyheterocyclic aromatic building blocks for forming conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs). However, the strong inter&#8208;molecular steric hindrance impedes the growth of HAT&#8208;based cMOFs. Here we employ on&#8208;surface synthesis to grow single&#8208;layer two&#8208;dimensional cMOFs of M3(HAT)2 (M=Ni, Fe, Co). Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) analysis, we resolve that the frameworks comprise a hexagonal lattice of HAT molecules and a Kagome lattice of metal atoms. The DFT analysis indicates that Ni, Co and Fe carry a magnetic moment of 1.1, 2.5, and 3.7&#8197;&#956;B, respectively. We anticipate that the small &#960;&#8208;conjugated core of HAT and strong bidentate chelating coordination give rise to appealing electronic and magnetic properties.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Hypercoordinated Silicon Anions: Catching Intermediates of Lewis Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis superacid bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane serves as a binding platform for weak anionic donors, providing the first characterized anionic bromido, iodido, formato, acetato, triflato, and sulfato silicates. This set allows to evaluate the structural and electronic perturbation of silicon species and substantiates their role in Lewis base catalysis.







Abstract
Anionic hypercoordinated silicates with weak donors were proposed as key intermediates in numerous silicon&#8208;based reactions. However, their short&#8208;lived nature rendered even spectroscopic observations highly challenging. Here, we characterize hypercoordinated silicon anions, including the first bromido&#8208;, iodido&#8208;, formato&#8208;, acetato&#8208;, triflato&#8208; and sulfato&#8208;silicates. This is enabled by a new, donor&#8208;free polymeric form of Lewis superacidic bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane 1. Spectroscopic, structural, and computational insights allow a reassessment of Gutmann's empirical rules for the role of silicon hypercoordination in synthesis and catalysis. The electronic perturbations of 1 exerted on the bound anions indicate pronounced substrate activation.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Metastable Species in Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Directed Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented mechanism for the supramolecular polymerization (SP) of H&#8208;bonding synthons has been unravelled. Remarkably, a new on&#8208;pathway metastable dimer state (D*) incorporating both intra&#8208; and intermolecular H&#8208;bonds was discovered that allows spatiotemporal and length control of the SP through a consecutive mechanism.







Abstract
We reveal unique hydrogen (H&#8208;) bonding patterns and exploit them to control the kinetics, pathways and length of supramolecular polymers (SPs). New bisamide&#8208;containing monomers were designed to elucidate the role of competing intra&#8208; vs. intermolecular H&#8208;bonding interactions on the kinetics of supramolecular polymerization (SP). Remarkably, two polymerization&#8208;inactive metastable states were discovered. Contrary to previous examples, the commonly assumed intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded monomer does not evolve into intermolecularly H&#8208;bonded SPs via ring opening, but rather forms a metastable dimer. In this dimer, all H&#8208;bonding sites are saturated, either intra&#8208; or intermolecularly, hampering elongation. The dimers exhibit an advantageous preorganization, which upon opening of the intramolecular portion of the H&#8208;bonding motif facilitates SP in a consecutive process. The retardation of spontaneous self&#8208;assembly as a result of two metastable states enables length control in SP by seed&#8208;mediated growth.

         <dc:description>
A family of fully sandwiched lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets derived from the tetraanionic arachno&#8208;carboranyl ligand possess a pseudo hexagonal&#8208;prismatic local coordination geometry which significantly enhances the magnetic axiality of the terbium(III) analogue.







Abstract
A family of fully sandwiched arachno&#8208;lanthanacarborane complexes formulated as {&#951;6&#8208;[&#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;[o&#8208;C6H4(CH2)2]&#8208;1,2&#8208;C2B10H10]2Ln}{Li5(THF)10} (Ln=Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Y) is successfully synthesized, where the &#8220;carbons&#8208;adjacent&#8221; carboranyl ligand (arachno&#8208;R2&#8208;C2B10H104&#8722;) bears four negative charges and coordinates to the central lanthanide ions using the hexagonal &#951;6C2B4 face. Thus, the central lanthanide cations are pseudo&#8208;twelve&#8208;coordinate and have an approximate pseudo&#8208;D6h symmetry or hexagonal&#8208;prismatic geometry. As the crystal field effect imparted by this geometry is still unknown, we thoroughly investigated the magnetic properties of this series of complexes and found that the crystal field imposed by this ligand causes a relation of Tb&gt;Dy&gt;Ho&gt;Er for the energy gaps between the ground and the first excited states, which is of striking resemblance to the ferrocenophane and phthalocyanine ligands although the latter two ligands give disparate local coordination geometries. Moreover, the effective energy barrier to magnetization reversal of 445(10)&#8197;K, the observable hysteresis loop up to 4&#8197;K and the relaxation time of the yttrium&#8208;diluted sample reaching 193(17) seconds at 2&#8197;K under an optimized field for the Tb analogue of this family of arachno&#8208;lanthanacarborane complexes, render a new benchmark for Tb3+&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnets.

         <title>Pushing Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries towards Practical Working Conditions through a Cathode&#8211;Electrolyte Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergy of cathode engineering and electrolyte manipulation effectively enhance redox kinetics and cycling stability of Li&#8722;S batteries. This strategy is demonstrated to be effective in achieving high performance under wide temperature situations and enabling a stable Li&#8722;S pouch cell under a thin Li&#8208;metal anode, thick S cathode, and lean electrolyte conditions.







Abstract
The commercialization of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is still hindered by the unsatisfactory cell performance under practical working conditions, which is mainly caused by the sluggish cathode redox kinetics, severe polysulfide shuttling, and poor Li stripping/plating reversibility. Herein, we report an effective strategy by combining Se&#8208;doped S hosted in an ordered macroporous framework with a highly fluorinated ether (HFE)&#8208;based electrolyte to simultaneously address the aforementioned issues in both cathode and anode. A reversible and stable high areal capacity of &gt;5.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with high Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.2&#8201;% can be achieved under high areal Se/S loading (5.8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), while the underlying mechanism was further revealed through synchrotron X&#8208;ray probes and Time&#8208;of&#8208;Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS). The practical application potential was further evaluated at low (0&#8201;&#176;C) and high (55&#8201;&#176;C) temperatures under high areal Se/S loading (&gt;5.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and thin Li metal (40&#8197;&#956;m).

         <title>Chemical Recycling of Poly(Cyclohexene Carbonate) Using a Di&#8208;MgII Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the chemical recycling of poly(cyclohexene carbonate) (PCHC) to cyclohexene oxide (CHO) with 98&#8201;% selectivity using a dinuclear MgII catalyst is reported. The chemical recycling and recovery of CHO under mild conditions further advances the utilization of CO2&#8208;polycarbonates as recyclable materials.







Abstract
Chemical recycling of polymers to true monomers is pivotal for a circular plastics economy. Here, the first catalyzed chemical recycling of the widely investigated carbon dioxide derived polymer, poly(cyclohexene carbonate), to cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide is reported. The reaction requires dinuclear catalysis, with the di&#8208;MgII catalyst showing both high monomer selectivity (&gt;98&#8201;%) and activity (TOF=150&#8197;h&#8722;1, 0.33&#8197;mol&#8201;%, 120&#8201;&#176;C). The depolymerization occurs via a chain&#8208;end catalyzed depolymerization mechanism and DFT calculations indicate the high selectivity arises from Mg&#8208;alkoxide catalyzed epoxide extrusion being kinetically favorable compared to cyclic carbonate formation.

An iterative approach that allows doubling the lenght of the longest pyrene&#8208;pyrazinoquinoxaline molecular nanoribbons is reported. The largest nanoribbon obtained through this approach shows a 60 linearly&#8208;fused ring backbone (14.9&#8197;nm) and a 324&#8208;atoms core (C276N48).







Abstract
Molecular nanoribbons are a class of atomically&#8208;precise nanomaterials for a broad range of applications. An iterative approach that allows doubling the length of the longest pyrene&#8208;pyrazinoquinoxaline molecular nanoribbons is described. The largest nanoribbon obtained through this approach&#8212;with a 60 linearly&#8208;fused ring backbone (14.9&#8197;nm) and a 324&#8208;atoms core (C276N48)&#8212;shows an extremely high molar absorptivity (values up to 1&#8201;198&#8201;074&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) that also endows it with a high molar fluorescence brightness (8700&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1).

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Free Copying of 12 Bases of RNA with Dinucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When dinucleotides were allowed to act as building blocks for enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying of RNA, sequences up to 12 bases in length were faithfully transmitted into the copy.







Abstract
The synthesis of complementary strands is the reaction underlying the replication of genetic information. It is likely that the earliest self&#8208;replicating systems used RNA as genetic material. How RNA was copied in the absence of enzymes and what sequences were most likely to have supported replication is not clear. Here we show that mixtures of dinucleotides with C and G as bases copy an RNA sequence of up to 12 nucleotides in dilute aqueous solution. Successful enzyme&#8208;free copying occurred with in situ activation at 4&#8201;&#176;C and pH&#8197;6.0. Dimers were incorporated in favor of monomers when both competed as reactants, and little misincorporation was detectable in mass spectra. Simulations using experimental rate constants confirmed that mixed C/G sequences are good candidates for successful replication with dimers. Because dimers are intermediates in the synthesis of longer strands, our results support evolutionary scenarios encompassing formation and copying of RNA strands in enzyme&#8208;free fashion.

Here we show that mixtures of dinucleotides with C and G as bases copy an RNA sequence of up to 12 nucleotides in dilute aqueous solution. Successful enzyme-free copying occurred with in situ activation at 4&#8201;&#176;C and pH&#8197;6.0. Dimers were incorporated in favor of monomers when both competed as reactants, and little misincorporation was detectable in mass spectra. Simulations using experimental rate constants confirmed that mixed C/G sequences are good candidates for successful replication with dimers. Because dimers are intermediates in the synthesis of longer strands, our results support evolutionary scenarios encompassing formation and copying of RNA strands in enzyme-free fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Alkylation of (Hetero)Arenes with Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient Co&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective alkylation of alkenes with indoles, thiophenes and electron rich arenes has been developed. This is the first CoH&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization using carbon nucleophiles via hydrogen atom transfer.







Abstract
An efficient and general intermolecular Cobalt(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkylation of styrenes with (hetero)arenes including indoles, thiophene and electron rich arenes has been developed, providing straightforward access to enantioenriched alkyl(hetero)arenes with high enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction underwent a CoH&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with alkenes, followed by a pivotal catalyst&#8208;controlled SN2&#8208;like pathway between in situ generated organocobalt(IV) species and aromatic nucleophiles. This is the first CoH&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization using carbon nucleophiles, providing a new strategy for asymmetric Friedel&#8211;Crafts type alkylation.

         <title>Anomalous Redox Features Induced by Strong Covalency in Layered NaTi1&#8722;yVyS2 Cathodes for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox voltage of doped cathodes usually falls in between the voltage of undoped layered cathodes. However, anomalous redox features were found in NaTi1&#8722;yVyS2. The discharge potential is 0.2&#8197;V higher than that of undoped cathodes. It is speculated that the anomalous voltage is mainly attributed to the strong covalency in the Ti&#8722;V&#8722;S system. Ti3+ and V3+ undergo charge transfer and form a more stable Ti (t2g0eg0) and V (t2g3eg0) electronic configuration.







Abstract
The rising demand for energy density of cathodes means the need to raise the voltage or capacity of cathodes. Transition metal (TM) doping has been employed to enhance the electrochemical properties in multiple aspects. The redox voltage of doped cathodes usually falls in between the voltage of undoped layered cathodes. However, we found anomalous redox features in NaTi1&#8722;yVyS2. The first discharge platform potential (2.4&#8197;V) is significantly higher than that of undoped NaTiS2 and NaVS2 (both around 2.2&#8197;V), and the energy density is raised by 15&#8201;%. We speculate that the anomalous voltage is mainly attributed to the strong hybridization in the Ti&#8722;V&#8722;S system. Ti3+ and V3+ undergo charge transfer and form a more stable Ti (t2g0eg0) and V (t2g3eg0) electronic configuration. Our results indicate that higher voltage of cathode materials could be achieved by strong TM&#8208;ligand covalency, and this conclusion provides possible opportunities to explore high voltage materials for future layered cathodes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development, roles, and applications of enzymes in reversible deactivation radical polymerization (Enz&#8208;RDRP) are summarized in this Minireview. A reflection on the challenges and future directions of this promising field are also given.







Abstract
Enzyme catalysis has been increasingly utilized in reversible deactivation radical polymerization (Enz&#8208;RDRP) on account of its mildness, efficiency, and sustainability. In this Minireview we discuss the key roles enzymes play in RDRP, including their ATRPase, initiase, deoxygenation, and photoenzyme activities. We use selected examples to highlight applications of Enz&#8208;RDRP in surface brush fabrication, sensing, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly, and high&#8208;throughput synthesis. We also give our reflections on the challenges and future directions of this emerging area.

         <title>Dynamic Interconversions of Single Molecules Probed by Recognition Tunneling at Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;Functionalized Supramolecular Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic conversions of single molecules can be monitored at doubly cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;functionalized supramolecular junctions. Through this intermolecular recognition tunneling technique, the molecular conductance of different analytes and analyte mixtures can be finger&#8208;printed in dependence on pH and competitive salts, showcasing the first examples of direct as well as displacement titrations of single host&#8211;guest complexes at electronic junctions.







Abstract
We introduce a versatile recognition tunneling technique using doubly cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;functionalized electrodes to form supramolecular junctions that capture analytes dynamically by host&#8211;guest complexation. This results in characteristic changes in their single&#8208;molecule conductance. For structurally related drug molecules (camptothecin, sanguinarine, chelerythrine, and berberine) and mixtures thereof, we observed distinct current switching signals related to their intrinsic conductance properties as well as pH&#8208;dependent effects which can be traced back to their different states (protonated versus neutral). The conductance variation of a single molecule with pH shows a sigmoidal distribution, allowing us to extract a pKa value for reversible protonation, which is consistent with the reported macroscopic results. The new electronic method allows the characterization of unmodified drug molecules and showcases the transfer of dynamic supramolecular chemistry principles to single molecules.

         <title>NIR&#8208;I&#8208;Responsive Single&#8208;Band Upconversion Emission through Energy Migration in Core&#8211;Shell&#8211;Shell Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To regulate the excitation and emission peaks of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) into the NIR&#8208;I bio&#8208;window, a new type of high&#8208;efficiency NIR&#8208;I&#8208;to&#8208;NIR&#8208;I UCNPs has been developed based on the elaborate combination of high&#8208;content Nd3+ sensitization, Yb&#8208;mediated energy migration, Mn2+&#8208;assisted exchange&#8208;energy transfer and core&#8208;multishell construction that exhibit intense single&#8208;band red luminescence upon 808&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;I laser excitation.







Abstract
Here we report a new strategy to tune both excitation and emission peaks of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) into the first infrared biowindow (NIR&#8208;I, 650&#8211;900&#8197;nm) with high NIR&#8208;I&#8208;to&#8208;NIR&#8208;I upconversion efficiency. By introducing the sensitizer Nd3+, activator Er3+, energy migrator Yb3+ and energy manipulator Mn2+ into specific region to construct proposed energy migration processes in the designed core&#8211;shell&#8211;shell nanoarchitecture, back energy transfer (BET) from activator to sensitizer or migrator can be greatly blocked and the NIR&#8208;to&#8208;red upconversion emission can be efficiently promoted. Consequently, BET&#8208;induced photon quenching and the undesired green&#8208;emitting radiative transition are entirely eliminated, leading to high&#8208;efficiency single&#8208;band red upconversion emission upon 808&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;I laser excitation. Our findings provide insights into fundamental lanthanide interactions and advance the development of UCNPs for bioapplications with techniques that overturn traditional limitations.

&lt;p&gt;To regulate the excitation and emission peaks of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) into the NIR-I bio-window, a new type of high-efficiency NIR-I-to-NIR-I UCNPs has been developed based on the elaborate combination of high-content Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; sensitization, Yb-mediated energy migration, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-assisted exchange-energy transfer and core-multishell construction that exhibit intense single-band red luminescence upon 808&#8197;nm NIR-I laser excitation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we report a new strategy to tune both excitation and emission peaks of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) into the first infrared biowindow (NIR-I, 650&#8211;900&#8197;nm) with high NIR-I-to-NIR-I upconversion efficiency. By introducing the sensitizer Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, activator Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, energy migrator Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and energy manipulator Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into specific region to construct proposed energy migration processes in the designed core&#8211;shell&#8211;shell nanoarchitecture, back energy transfer (BET) from activator to sensitizer or migrator can be greatly blocked and the NIR-to-red upconversion emission can be efficiently promoted. Consequently, BET-induced photon quenching and the undesired green-emitting radiative transition are entirely eliminated, leading to high-efficiency single-band red upconversion emission upon 808&#8197;nm NIR-I laser excitation. Our findings provide insights into fundamental lanthanide interactions and advance the development of UCNPs for bioapplications with techniques that overturn traditional limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Mesoporous Crystalline TiO2 Materials by Monomicelle Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring mesoporous TiO2 at the mesoscopic and microscopic level has been advancing in the last decade as its unique nanoscale architectures are of great importance for various applications. This Review surveys and discusses how to synthesize a series of novel mesoporous TiO2 materials, with the aim of highlighting how precise control can be achieved over the mesostructure and also potential synthetic directions.







Abstract
Mesoscale TiO2 structures have realized many technological applications&#8212;ranging from catalysis and biomedicine to energy storage and conversion&#8212;because of their large mesoporosities offering desirable accessibility and mass transport. Tailoring mesoporous TiO2 structures with novel mesoscopic and microscopic configurations is envisaged to offer ample opportunities for further applications. In this Review, we explain how to synthesize novel mesoporous TiO2 materials and present recent examples. An emphasis is placed on a &#8220;monomicelle assembly&#8221; strategy as an emerging and powerful approach to direct the formation of mesostructured TiO2 with precise control over its structural orientations and architectures. Furthermore, typical examples of mesoporous TiO2 for applications in batteries and photocatalysis are highlighted. The Review ends with an outlook towards the synthesis of mesoporous TiO2 with tailored architectures by self&#8208;assembly, which could pave the way for developing advanced energy conversion and storage devices.

         <title>Avoiding Structural Collapse to Reduce Lead Leakage in Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal structural collapse in perovskite films governs the Pb leakage after exposed to water as indicated by Noyes&#8208;Whitney Model simulation. It is effectively retarded by constructing a chemically stable Dion&#8208;Jacobson two&#8208;dimension (2D) perovskite (DOE)PbI4&#8722;xClx at the surface of the film.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a promising candidate for the next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technologies. As an essential element for high&#8208;efficiency PSCs however, the heavy metal Pb is soluble in water, causing a serious threat to the environment and human health. Due to the weak ionic bonding in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites, drastic structure decomposition occurs when immersing the perovskite film in water, which accelerates the Pb leakage. By introducing the chemically stable Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) 2D perovskite at the 3D perovskite surface, the film dissolution is significantly slowed down, which retards lead leakage. As a result, the Pb contamination is dramatically reduced under various extreme conditions. In addition, the PSCs device deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.6&#8201;% and retain over 95&#8201;% of their initial PCE after the maximum power point tracking for over 1100&#8197;h.

         <title>Modular Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Concave Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for High&#8208;Performance Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Tunable Emission Mechanisms**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curved and fully conjugated N&#8208;pyrrolic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (N&#8208;PAHs) were utilized as efficient emitters in thermally activated delayed fluorescence organic light&#8208;emitting diode (TADF/OLED) devices. The curvature increases the spatial separation between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, leading to low singlet&#8211;triplet gaps, which are essential for high reverse intersystem crossing rates. The overall photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is up to 86&#8201;%.







Abstract
Although bowl&#8208;shaped N&#8208;pyrrolic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can achieve excellent electron&#8208;donating ability, their application for optoelectronics is hampered by typically low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). To address this issue, we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of curved and fully conjugated nitrogen&#8208;doped PAHs. Through structural modifications to the electron&#8208;accepting moiety, we are able to switch the mechanism of luminescence between thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), and to tune the overall PLQY in the range from 9&#8201;% to 86&#8201;%. As a proof of concept, we constructed solid&#8208;state organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) devices, which has not been explored to date in the context of concave N&#8208;doped systems being TADF/RTP emitters. The best&#8208;performing dye, possessing a peripheral trifluoromethyl group adjacent to the phenazine acceptor, exhibits yellow to orange emission with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 12&#8201;%, which is the highest EQE in a curved D&#8208;A embedded N&#8208;PAH to date.

         <title>Machine Learning for Chemical Reactivity The Importance of Failed Experiments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Assessing the outcomes of chemical reactions in a quantitative fashion has been a cornerstone across all synthetic disciplines. Classically approached through empirical optimization, data&#8208;driven modelling bears an enormous potential to streamline this process. However, such predictive models require significant quantities of high&#8208;quality data, the availability of which is limited: Main reasons for this include experimental errors and, importantly, human biases regarding experiment selection and result reporting. In a series of case studies, we investigate the impact of these biases for drawing general conclusions from chemical reaction data, revealing the utmost importance of &#8220;negative&#8221; examples. Eventually, case studies into data expansion approaches showcase directions to circumvent these limitations &#8211; and demonstrate perspectives towards a long&#8208;term data quality enhancement in chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid High&#8208;contrast Photoreversible Coloration of Surface&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;doped TiO2 Nanocrystals for Rewritable Light&#8208;Printing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pristine titanium dioxide (TiO2) changes color from white to black when it is reduced from Ti(IV) to Ti(III) by photoexcited electrons. However, the black coloration requires substantial light energy to create, and it vanishes instantaneously upon exposure to air. This work reports the synthesis of surface&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;doped TiO2 nanocrystals that rapidly change color (i.e., within seconds) from whitish to black under low&#8208;power irradiation with excellent color stability in atmospheric conditions. The N&#8208;doping plays a critical role in promoting the surface&#8208;adsorption of polyol groups to stabilize the Ti(III) species and accelerate the coloration process. A rewritable paper fabricated using these nanocrystals exhibits excellent writing and erasing reversibility in response to UV irradiation and oxygen exposure. The low&#8208;cost, rapid response, excellent reversibility, and good color stability are vital advantages of N&#8208;doped TiO2 nanocrystals for color&#8208;switching applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Fluorescent Bipyrrole&#8208;based Tetra&#8208;BF2 Flag&#8208;hinge Chromophores: Achieving Multicolor and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports the facile syntheses of tetra&#8208;boron difluoride (tetra&#8208;BF  2  ) complexes, flag&#8208;hinge&#8208;like molecules that exhibit intense green&#8208;to&#8208;orange luminescence in solution and yellow&#8208;to&#8208;red emission in the solid states. Single&#8208;crystal structure analysis and density functional theory calculations suggested a bent structure of this series of compounds. The complexes also exhibited excellent optical properties, with quantum yields reaching 100% and a large Stokes shift. These properties were attributed to the altered bending angle of the molecule in the S  1  excited state. As the rotational motion was suppressed around the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyrrole axis, atropisomers with axial chirality were formed, which are optically resolvable into (  R  ) and (  S  )&#8208;enantiomers through a chiral column. The atropisomers thus function as circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials, in which the color (green, green&#8208;yellow, and yellow) can be varied by controlling the aggregation state. This rational design of multi&#8208;BF  2  complexes can potentially realize novel photofunctional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cocatalyst Strategy to Enhance Ruthenium&#8208;Mediated Metathesis Reactivity towards Electron&#8208;Deficient Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ruthenium&#8208;mediated olefin metathesis has been widely applied for the synthesis of various organic molecules and polymers. Inspired by the cocatalyst strategy for olefin polymerization, here we demonstrate that the abstraction of a chloride ion from various commercially available ruthenium catalysts significantly enhances their reactivity towards electron&#8208;deficient internal olefins. This cocatalyst strategy can be implemented in ethenolysis and cross&#8208;metathesis reactions of FG&#8208;CH=CH&#8208;FG type substrates bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups and the synthesis of telechelic polymers that can be converted to polyethylene&#8208;like materials with closed&#8208;loop recycling properties. The copolymerization cyclic substrate with cycloolefins followed by hydrogenation afforded polyolefin materials with in&#8208;chain break points. Interestingly, switchable catalysis was achieved in the absence and presence of a cocatalyst, which allowed the polymer microstructure and material properties to be fine&#8208;tuned.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexible Cuprous Triazolate Frameworks as Highly Stable and Efficient Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction with Tunable C2H4/CH4 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks have attracted much attention for electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction, but they are generally instable and difficult to control the product selectivity. We report flexible Cu(I) triazolate frameworks as efficient, stable, and tunable electrocatalysts for CO  2&#160;  reduction to C  2  H  4  /CH  4  . By changing the size of ligand side groups, the C  2  H  4  /CH  4  selectivity ratio can be gradually tuned and inversed from 11.8:1 to 1:2.6, giving C  2  H  4  , CH  4  , and hydrocarbon selectivities up to 51%, 56%, and 77%, respectively. After long&#8208;term electrocatalysis, they can retain the structures/morphologies without formation of Cu&#8208;based inorganic species. Computational simulations showed that the coordination geometry of Cu(I) changed from triangular to tetrahedral to bind the reaction intermediates, and two adjacent Cu(I) cooperated for C&#8211;C coupling to form C  2  H  4  . Importantly, the ligand side groups controlled the catalyst flexibility by the steric hindrance mechanism, and the C  2  H  4  pathway is more sensitive than the CH  4  one.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Metal&#8208;Free Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescent Copolymer for Low Flicker AC&#8208;LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic room&#8208;temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescent materials are promising light&#8208;emitting materials for encryption, architectural decoration, organic solar cells, and biomedical applications. However, their unstable structures and thermal&#8208; and humidity&#8208;induced emission quenching have greatly limited their utility and reliability. Here, we report a metal&#8208;free nonconjugated copolymer that possesses stable photoluminescence at both high temperature and humidity. The room temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) of this copolymer lasts for more than 15 s and can be recovered in high humidity conditions by heating to remove moisture. Copolymer LPL can be achieved with various excitation wavelengths, ranging from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared, and the LPL color can be adjusted accordingly. The high initial LPL intensity and ultrafast filling time of the copolymer makes it suitable for low flicker alternating current&#8208;driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (AC&#8208;LEDs).</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Sensitive Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CO over Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate a new case of materials&#8208;gene engineering to precisely design photocatalysts with the prescribed properties. Based on theoretical calculations, a phase&#8208;doping strategy was proposed to regulate the pathways of CO2 conversion over Au nanoparticles (NPs) loaded TiO2 photocatalysts. As a result, the thermodynamic bottleneck of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion is successfully unlocked by the incorporation of stable twinning crystal planes into face centered cubic (fcc) &#160;phase Au NPs. Compared to bare pristine TiO2, the activity results showed that the loading of regular fcc&#8208;Au NPs raised the CO production by 18&#8208;fold but suppressed the selectivity from 84% to 75%, whereas Au NPs with twinning (110) and (100) facets boosted the activity by nearly 40&#8208;fold and established near unity CO selectivity. This enhancement is shown to originate from a beneficial shift in the surface reactive site energetics arising at the twinned stacking fault, whereby both the CO reaction energy and desorption energy were significantly reduced.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;catalyzed radical enantioselective carbo&#8208;esterification of styrenes enabled by a perfluoroalkylated&#8208;PyBox ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral lactones are found in many natural products. The reaction of simple alkenes with iodoacetic acid is a powerful method to build lactones, but the enantioselective version of this reaction has not been implemented to date. Herein, we report efficient catalytic radical enantioselective carbo&#8208;esterification of styrenes enabled by a newly developed Cu(I)&#8208;perfluoroalkylated PyBox system. Simple styrenes have been converted to useful chiral lactones whose synthetic applications are showcased. The mechanistic studies reveal that this reaction is a rare example of an efficient ligand&#8208;decelerated system in which the ligand deaccelerates the reaction but the reaction is still efficient with reduced amounts of the ligand. This uncommon catalytic system may inspire further consideration of the effect of ligands in asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Silylene Stabilized by a &#963;&#8208;Donating Ni(0) Fragment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A donor&#8208;stabilized silylene  4  featuring a Ni(0)&#8208;based donating ligand was synthesized. Complex  4  exhibits a pyramidalized and nucleophilic Si(II) center and shows a peculiar behavior due to the cooperative reactivity of Si and Ni centers. Calculations indicate that the orientation of Ni&#8208;ligands with respect to the silylene moiety is crucial in determining the role of Ni&#8208;fragment (Lewis acid or Lewis base) towards silylene. Indeed, a simple 90&#176; rotate of Si&#8208;Ni&#8208;bond, reverses the role of Ni, and transforms a classical silylene&#8594;Ni(0) complex into an unprecedented Ni(0)&#8594;silylene complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Temperature&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Borylative Cyclizations of Enynes: BCl3&#8208;Promoted Skeletal Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free borylative cyclization of biphenyl&#8208;embedded 1,3,5&#8208;trien&#8208;7&#8208;ynes in the presence of simple and inexpensive BCl3 provided synthetically useful borylated building blocks. The outcome of the process depends on the reaction temperature, with borylated phenanthrenes obtained at 60 &#186;C and phenanthrene&#8208;fused borylated cyclobutanes formed at 0 &#186;C. Based on DFT calculations, a mechanism for these novel transformations has been proposed, which involves an uncommon skeletal rearrangement, including migration of a methyl group and alkyne fragmentation, unprecedented in BCl3&#8208;promoted cyclization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Diffraction Enables the Mapping of Coke in ZSM&#8208;5 Micropores Formed during Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbons Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unveiling the coke formation in zeolites is an essential prerequisite for tackling the deactivation of these catalysts in the transformations of hydrocarbons. Herein, we present the direct mapping of coke in the micropores of ZSM&#8209;5 catalysts used in methanol&#8209;to&#8209;hydrocarbons conversion by single&#8208;crystal electron diffraction analysis. The latter technique revealed a polycyclic aromatic structure along the straight channel, wherein the high quality data permit refinement of its occupancy to about 40%. These findings were exploited to analyze the evolution of micropore coke during the reaction. Herein, coke&#8209;associated signals, which correlate with the activity loss, indicate that the nucleation of coke commences in the intersections of sinusoidal and straight channels and is following by coke formation in the straight pores in the late stages of deactivation. The findings uncover an attractive method for analyzing coke deposition in the micropore domain.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorescent Cage for Supramolecular Sensing of 3&#8208;Nitrotyrosine in Human Blood Serum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3&#8208;Nitrotyrosine (NT) is generated by the action of peroxynitrite and other reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and as a consequence it is accumulated in inflammation&#8208;associated conditions. This is particularly relevant in kidney disease, where NT concentration in blood is considerably high. Therefore, NT is a crucial biomarker of renal damage, although it has been underestimated in clinical diagnosis due to the lack of an appropriate sensing method. Herein we report the first fluorescent supramolecular sensor for such a relevant compound: Fluorescence by rotational restriction of tetraphenylethenes (TPE) in a covalent cage is selectively quenched in human blood serum by 3&#8208;nitrotyrosine (NT) that binds to the cage with high affinity, allowing a limit of detection within the reported physiological concentrations of NT in chronic kidney disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantification of Biocatalytic Transformations by Single Microbial Cells Enabled by Tailored Integration of Droplet Microfluidics and Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving the performance of chemical transformations catalysed by microbial biocatalysts requires a deep understanding of cellular processes. While the cellular heterogeneity of cellular characteristics, such as the concentration of high abundant cellular content, is well studied, little is known about the reactivity of individual cells and its impact on the chemical identity, quantity, and purity of excreted products. Biocatalytic transformations were monitored chemically specific and quantifiable at the single&#8208;cell level by integrating droplet microfluidics, cell imaging, and mass spectrometry. Product formation rates for individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were obtained by i)&#160;incubating nanolitre&#8208;sized droplets for product accumulation in microfluidic devices, ii) an imaging setup to determine the number of cells in the droplets, and iii)&#160;electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry for reading the chemical contents of individual droplets. These findings now enable the study of whole&#8208;cell biocatalysis at single&#8208;cell resolution.</dc:description>
