         <title>Highly Coordinated Heteronuclear Calcium&#8208;Iron Carbonyl Cation Complexes [CaFe(CO)n]+ (n = 5 &#8208; 12) with d&#8208;d Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteronuclear calcium&#8208;iron carbonyl cation complexes in the form of [CaFe(CO)  n  ]  +  (n = 5 &#8208; 12) are produced in the gas phase. Infrared photodissociation spectroscopy in conjunction with quantum chemical calculations confirm that the n = 10 complex is the coordination saturated ion where a Fe(CO)  4  fragment is bonded with a Ca(CO)  6  fragment through two side&#8208;on bridging carbonyl ligands. Bonding analysis indicates that it is best described by the bonding interactions between a [Ca(CO)  6  ]  2+  dication and an [Fe(CO)  4  ]  &#8208;  anion forming a Fe&#8594;Ca d&#8208;d dative bond in the [(CO)  6  Ca&#8208;Fe(CO)  4  ]  +  structure, which enriches the pool of experimentally observed complexes of calcium that mimic transition metal compounds. The molecule is the first example of a heteronuclear carbonyl complex featuring a d&#8208;d bond between calcium and a transition metal.</dc:description>

         <title>(2&#8208;Ethylhexyl)sodium: A Hexane&#8208;Soluble Reagent for Br/Na&#8208;Exchanges and Directed Metalations in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the on&#8208;demand generation of hexane&#8208;soluble (2&#8208;ethylhexyl)sodium (    1    ) from 3&#8208;(chloromethyl)heptane (    2    ) using a sodium&#8208;packed&#8208;bed reactor under continuous flow conditions. Thus, the resulting solution of    1    is free of elemental sodium and therefore suited for a range of synthetic applications. This new procedure avoids the storage of an alkylsodium and limits the handling of metallic sodium to a minimum. (2&#8208;Ethylhexyl)sodium (    1    ) proved to be a very useful reagent and undergoes in&#8208;line Br/Na&#8208;exchanges as well as directed sodiations. The resulting arylsodium intermediates are subsequently trapped in batch with various electrophiles such as ketones, aldehydes, Weinreb&#8208;amides, imines, allyl bromides, disulfides and alkyl iodides. A reaction scale&#8208;up of the Br/Na&#8208;exchange using an in&#8208;line electrophile quench was also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Ce=O Terminated CeO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiply&#8208;bonded lanthanide oxo groups are rare in coordination compounds and have not previously been reported for a surface termination of a lanthanide oxide. Here we report the observation of a Ce=O terminated ceria surface in a CeO  2  (111)&#8208;( [[EQUATION]] x [[EQUATION]] )R30&#176; reconstruction of ~3 nm thick ceria islands prepared on Pt(111). This is evidenced by scanning tunnelling microscopy, low energy electron diffraction and high&#8208;resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) measurements in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A Ce=O stretching frequency of 775 cm  &#8208;1  is observed in HREELS, compared with 766 cm  &#8208;1  calculated by DFT. The calculations also predict that the Ce=O bond is weak, with an oxygen vacancy formation energy of 0.85 eV. This could play an important role in the facile removal of lattice oxygen from CeO  2  , accompanied by the reduction of Ce  IV  to Ce  III  , which is a key attribute of ceria&#8208;based systems in connection with their unique catalytic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Silicon tetrakis(trifluoromethanesulfonate): A Simple Neutral Silane Acting as a Soft and Hard Lewis Superacid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile synthesis and isolation of pristine silicon tetrakis(trifluoromethanesulfonate), Si(OTf)4, is reported, acting as the first neutral silicon&#8208;based Lewis superacid suitable towards soft and hard Lewis bases. Its OTf groups have a dual function: they are excellent leaving groups and modulate the degree of reactivity towards soft and hard Lewis bases. Exposed to soft Lewis donors, Si(OTf)4 leads to [L2Si(OTf)4] complexes (L = isocyanide, thioether and carbonyl compounds) with retention of all Si&#8211;OTf bonds. In contrast, it can cleave C&#8211;X bonds (X = F, Cl) of hard organic Lewis bases with a high tendency to form SiX4 (X = F, Cl) after halide/triflate exchange. Most notable, Si(OTf)4 allows a gentle oxydefluorination of mono&#8208; and bis(trifluoromethyl)benzenes, resulting in the formation of the corresponding benzoylium species, which are stabilized by the weakly coordinating [Si(OTf)6] dianion.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The development of materials integrated&#160;with&#160;ultrasmall&#160;multi&#8208;metal nanoparticles (UMMNs) and mesoporous zeolite is a considerable challenge in chemistry and materials science.&#160;We designed trifunctional surfactant, in which the&#160;pyridyl benzimidazole&#160;in the hydrophobic tail generates the mesopores through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking; the diquaternary ammonium in the hydrophilic headgroup direct the formation of MFI zeolite sheets and the&#160;nitrogen atoms&#160;in&#160;heterocyclic ringscoordinate&#160;with&#160;various metal ions to&#160;form&#160;UMMNs confined&#160;in the zeolite matrix&#160;after calcination and reduction.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Vinylogous Addition Reactions Initiated by Meinwald Rearrangement of Vinyl Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first catalytic asymmetric multiple vinylogous addition reactions initiated by Meinwald rearrangement of vinyl epoxides were realized by employing chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/Sc(III) complex catalysts. The vinyl epoxides, as masked &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, via direct vinylogous additions with isatins, 2&#8208;alkenoylpyridines or methyleneindolinones, provided a facile and efficient way for the synthesis of chiral 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted oxindoles, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and spiro&#8208;cyclohexene indolinones, respectively with high efficiency and stereoselectivity. The control experiments and kinetic studies revealed that the Lewis acid acted as dual&#8208;tasking catalyst, controlling the initial rearrangement to match subsequent enantioselective vinylogous addition reactions. A catalytic cycle with a possible transition model was proposed to illustrate the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

A catalytic cycle with a possible transition model was proposed to illustrate the reaction mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Starting from a [( MeO  C^N^C)AuCl] complex as precursor, a direct substitution by C,H&#8208;activation from sp&#8208;, sp 2  &#8208; or sp 3  &#8208;C,H&#8208;bonds under basic conditions in a planetary ball mill was achieved. Because of the extraordinary photophysical properties of the target compounds, this protocol provides an easy access to a highly valued complex class. In contrast to existing protocols, no pre&#8208;functionalization of the starting materials is necessary and the use of expensive transition metal catalysts can be avoided, which makes this application appealing also for industrial purposes.

         <title>Production of Piperidine and &#948;&#8208;Lactam Chemicals from Biomass&#8208;Derived Triacetic Acid Lactone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piperidine and &#948;&#8208;Lactam chemicals have wide application, which are currently produced from fossil resource in industry. Production of this kind of chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass is of great importance, but is challenging and the reported routes give low yield. Herein, we demonstrate the strategy to synthesize 2&#8208;methyl piperidine (  MP  ) and 6&#8208;methylpiperidin&#8208;2&#8208;one (  MPO  ) from biomass&#8208;derived triacetic acid lactone (  TAL  ) that is produced microbially from glucose. In this route,  TAL  was firstly converted into 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;6&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one (  HMPO  ) through facile aminolysis, subsequently  HMPO  was selectively transformed into  MP  or  MPO  over Ru catalysts supported on beta zeolite (Ru/BEA&#8208;X, X is the molar ratio of Si to Al)  via  the tandem reaction.  It was found that the yield of  MP  could reach 76.5% over Ru/BEA&#8208;60 in  t  &#8208;BuOH, and the yield of  MPO  could be 78.5% in dioxane. Systematic studies reveal that the excellent catalytic performance of Ru/BEA&#8208;60 was closely correlated with the cooperative effects between active metal and acidic zeolite with large pore geometries. The related reaction pathway was studied on the basis of control experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Broadening and Enhancement of Cr3+ Photoluminescence in LiIn2SbO6 by Chemical Unit Cosubstitution: Night&#8208;Vision and Near&#8208;Infrared Spectroscopy Detection Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emitting phosphor materials have been extensively developed for optoelectronic and biomedical applications. Although Cr3+&#8208;activated phosphors have been widely reported, it is challenging to achieve ultra&#8208;broad and tunable NIR emission. Here, a new ultra&#8208;broadband NIR&#8208;emitting LiIn2SbO6:Cr  3+  phosphor with emission peak at 965 nm and a full&#8208;width at half maximum of 217 nm is reported. Controllable emission tuning from 965 to 892 nm is achieved by chemical unit cosubstitution of [Zn2+&#8211;Zn2+  ] for [Li+&#8211;In3+  ], which can be ascribed to the upshift of  4T2g  energy level due to the strengthened crystal field. Moreover, the emission is greatly enhanced, and the FWHM reaches 235 nm. The as&#8208;prepared luminescent tunable NIR&#8208;emitting phosphors have demonstrated the potential in night&#8208;vision and NIR spectroscopy techniques. This work proves the feasibility of chemical unit cosubstitution strategy in emission tuning of Cr3+&#8208;doped phosphors, which can stimulate further studies on the emission&#8208;tunable NIR&#8208;emitting phosphor materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Total synthesis and structural characterization of caveolin&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Caveolin&#8208;1, which is an essential protein for caveola formation, was chemically synthesized. It is composed of 177 amino acid residues, triply palmitoylated at the C&#8208;terminus region and supposed to be inserted into the lipid bilayer forming a V&#8208;shaped structure in the middle of the polypeptide chain. The entire sequence was divided into 5 peptide segments and each of them was synthesized by the solid&#8208;phase method. To improve the solubility of the C&#8208;terminal region, the O&#8208;acyl isopeptide structures were incorporated. After the ligation by the thioester method and the introduction of the palmitoyl groups, all the protecting groups were removed and the isopeptide structures were converted to the native peptide bond. Finally, the obtained polypeptide was successfully inserted into the bicelle, thus showing the success of the synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Initial Coulombic Efficiency Induced by Interface Engineering Enables Rapid, Stable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;repairing&#8208;induced dot&#8211;matrix distributed interface efficiently catalyzes electrolyte decomposition. This strategy enables an ultra&#8208;thin and robust solid&#8211;electrolyte interface achieving ultra&#8208;high initial coulombic efficiency in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
High initial coulombic efficiency is highly desired because it implies effective interface construction and few electrolyte consumption, indicating enhanced batteries&#8217; life and power output. In this work, a high&#8208;capacity sodium storage material with FeS2 nanoclusters (&#8776;1&#8211;2&#8197;nm) embedded in N, S&#8208;doped carbon matrix (FeS2/N,S&#8208;C) was synthesized, the surface of which displays defects&#8208;repaired characteristic and detectable dot&#8208;matrix distributed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/Fe&#8208;S&#8208;C bonds. After the initial discharging process, the uniform ultra&#8208;thin NaF&#8208;rich (&#8776;6.0&#8197;nm) solid electrolyte interphase was obtained, thereby achieving verifiable ultra&#8208;high initial coulombic efficiency (&#8776;92&#8201;%). The defects&#8208;repaired surface provides perfect platform, and the catalysis of dot&#8208;matrix distributed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/Fe&#8208;S&#8208;C bonds to the rapid decomposing of NaSO3CF3 and diethylene glycol dimethyl ether successfully accelerate the building of two&#8208;dimensional ultra&#8208;thin solid electrolyte interphase. DFT calculations further confirmed the catalysis mechanism. As a result, the constructed FeS2/N,S&#8208;C provides high reversible capacity (749.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and outstanding cycle stability (92.7&#8201;%, 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles, 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Especially, at &#8722;15&#8201;&#176;C, it also obtains a reversible capacity of 211.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Assembled pouch&#8208;type cell performs potential application. The insight in this work provides a bright way to interface design for performance improvement in batteries.

         <title>Regulating the Solvation Sheath of Li Ions by Using Hydrogen Bonds for Highly Stable Lithium&#8211;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to regulate the solvation sheath by introducing hydrogen bonds for constructing high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;metal batteries is proposed. Depending on the hydrogen bonding of the additives with both the anions of Li salt and the solvent, the regulated solvation sheath promoted the formation of desirable solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase with more LiF component and stabilized the electrolytes.







Abstract
The performance of Li anodes is extremely affected by the solvation of Li ions, leading to preferential reduction of the solvation sheath and subsequent formation of fragile solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI), Li dendrites, and low coulombic efficiency (CE). Herein, we propose a novel strategy to regulate the solvation sheath, through the introduction of intermolecular hydrogen bonds with both the anions of Li salt and the solvent by small amount additives. The addition of such hydrogen bonds reduced the LUMO energy level of anions in electrolyte, promoted the formation of a robust SEI, reduced the amount of free solvent molecules, and enhanced stability of electrolytes. Based on this strategy, flat and dense lithium deposition was obtained. Even under lean electrolytes, at a current density of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a fixed capacity of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the Li&#8211;Cu cells showed an impressive CE value of 99.2&#8201;%. The Li&#8208;LiFePO4 full cells showed long&#8208;term cycling stability for more than 1000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C, with a total capacity loss of only 15&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Size&#8208;Controlled m&#8208;Pyridine&#8211;Urea Oligomers and Their Biomimetic Chloride Ion Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligomers with distinct self&#8208;folding and self&#8208;assembly behaviour are constructed by using m&#8208;pyridine&#8211;urea repeating units, an important feature of which is that the urea carbonyl tends to point outward and the NH unit tends to direct inward. Among these oligomers, the trimer forms nanotubes, which can efficiently transport Cl&#8722; ions.







Abstract
The m&#8208;pyridine urea (mPU) oligomer was constructed by using the intramolecular hydrogen bond formed by the pyridine nitrogen atom and the NH of urea and the intermolecular hydrogen bond of the terminal carbonyl group and the NH of urea. Due to the synergistic effect of hydrogen bonds, mPU oligomer folds and exhibits strong self&#8208;assembly behaviour. Affected by folding, mPU oligomer generates a twisted plane, and one of its important features is that the carbonyl group of the urea group orientates outwards from the twisted plane, while the NHs tend to direct inward. This feature is beneficial to NH attraction for electron&#8208;rich species. Among them, the trimer self&#8208;assembles into helical nanotubes, and can efficiently transport chloride ions. This study provides a novel and efficient strategy for constructing self&#8208;assembled biomimetic materials for electron&#8208;rich species transmission.

         <title>Structural Basis for Pore Blockade of the Human Cardiac Sodium Channel Nav1.5 by the Antiarrhythmic Drug Quinidine**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cryo&#8208;EM structure of human cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 in complex with quinidine reveals the molecular basis for pore blockade of Nav1.5 by class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs. An advanced and comprehensive structural understanding of the mechanism of action of antiarrhythmic drugs will facilitate drug discovery targeting Nav channels.







Abstract
Nav1.5, the primary voltage&#8208;gated Na+ (Nav) channel in heart, is a major target for class I antiarrhythmic agents. Here we present the cryo&#8208;EM structure of full&#8208;length human Nav1.5 bound to quinidine, a class Ia antiarrhythmic drug, at 3.3&#8197;&#197; resolution. Quinidine is positioned right beneath the selectivity filter in the pore domain and coordinated by residues from repeats I, III, and IV. Pore blockade by quinidine is achieved through both direct obstruction of the ion permeation path and induced rotation of an invariant Tyr residue that tightens the intracellular gate. Structural comparison with a truncated rat Nav1.5 in the presence of flecainide, a class Ic agent, reveals distinct binding poses for the two antiarrhythmics within the pore domain. Our work reported here, along with previous studies, reveals the molecular basis for the mechanism of action of class I antiarrhythmic drugs.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Alsmaphorazine&#8197;C and Formal Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Strictamine: A Photo&#8208;Fries Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous&#8208;flow photo&#8208;Fries/imine capture cascade process efficiently assembles the 2,7&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;fused tetrahydrocarbazole framework of strychnos and akuammiline&#8208;type monoterpene indole alkaloids. Based on this crucial transformation, the first asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;alsmaphorazine&#8197;C and formal synthesis of (+)&#8208;strictamine have been accomplished.







Abstract
A bioinspired photo&#8208;Fries/imine capture cascade reaction was developed in continuous&#8208;flow mode, which facilitated the rapid construction of a series of diversely functionalized 2,7&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;fused tetrahydrocarbazoles, the ubiquitous core structures embedded in strychnos and akuammiline&#8208;type monoterpene indole alkaloids. The synthetic utility of this novel method has been preliminarily explored by the first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;alsmaphorazine&#8197;C and formal synthesis of (+)&#8208;strictamine in a concise and efficient manner.

         <title>Bridging thermal catalysis and electrocatalysis: Catalyzing CO2 conversion with carbon&#8208;based materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the differences between reactions driven by elevated temperature or electric potential remains challenging, largely due to materials incompatibilities between thermal catalytic and electrocatalytic environments. We show that Ni, N&#8208;doped carbon (NiPACN), an electrocatalyst for the reduction of CO2 to CO (CO2R), can also selectively catalyze thermal CO2 to CO via the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) representing a direct analogy between catalytic phenomena across the two reaction environments. Advanced characterization techniques reveal that NiPACN likely facilitates RWGS on dispersed Ni sites in agreement with CO2R active site studies. Finally, we construct a generalized reaction driving&#8208;force that includes temperature and potential and suggest that NiPACN could facilitate faster kinetics in CO2R relative to RWGS due to lower intrinsic barriers. This report motivates further studies that quantitatively link catalytic phenomena across disparate reaction environments.</dc:description>

Herein, we present the first example of reversible and controllable mesopore generation and renovation in a microporous MOF of HKUST&#8208;1 via synthetic manipulation at molecular scale. An ammonia&#8208;gas etching strategy is proposed to create mesopores in carboxylate&#8208;based microporous MOFs and thus produce HP&#8208;MOFs. Gas&#8208;phase etching ensures uniform mesopore formation inside the MOF crystals via plane&#8208;oriented cutting the carboxylate&#8208; metal&#160; bonds off without affecting the crystal size and morphology. The mesopore size is controlled by the etching temperature, while the mesopore volume could be tuned by adjusting etchant pressure. The generated mesopores could be renovated using MOF precursors solutions so that to achieve controllable mesopore generation/closure, and encapsulation of the adsorbed molecules. This work demonstrates a powerful protocol for precisely tailoring and tuning the properties of MOF materials at molecular scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Deconstructive Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Morphine&#8208;Family Alkaloid (&#8208;)&#8208;Thebainone A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the development of a deconstructive strategy for the first asymmetric synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;thebainone A, capitalized on an enantioselective C&#8208;C bond activation and a C&#8208;O bond cleavage reaction. The Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric &#8216;cut&#8208;and&#8208;sew&#8217; transformation between sterically hindered trisubstituted alkenes and benzocyclobutenones allows efficient construction of the fused A/B/C rings and the all&#8208;carbon quaternary center of the natural product. The newly optimized conditions show a broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99.5:0.5 er). Taking advantage of the boron&#8208;mediated ether bond cleavage, synthesis of the morphine&#8208;alkaloid (&#8208;)&#8208;thebainone A has been completed with two complementary routes.</dc:description>

         <title>LiZn(OH)CO3: A Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Hydroxycarbonate Designed from Diamond&#8208;like Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are vital to the development of science and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies, but the exploration of these important optoelectronic materials is hindered by the contradiction between NLO effect and energy band gap as well as the sensitivity of DUV phase&#8208;matching to optical birefringence. Here, in order to achieve the well balanced DUV NLO performance, we chose the diamond&#8208;like structure as the prototype template for the material design and synthesize the first DUV NLO hydroxycarbonate crystal LiZn(OH)CO3. This compound simultaneously has wide band gap (&gt; 6.53 eV), strong second harmonic generation response (~3.2 &#215; KDP), and large birefringence (0.147@1064 nm) with the shortest DUV phase&#8208;matching capability (&#955;PM &lt; 190 nm) among all reported NLO carbonates. Moreover, the structure&#8208;property relationships in LiZn(OH)CO3 are analyzed by first&#8208;principles calculations. This work presents an effective design strategy to push the NLO performance of hydroxycarbonates into the DUV region.</dc:description>

         <title>Swelling&#8208;Induced Symmetry Breaking: A Versatile Approach to the Scalable Production of Colloidal Particles with a Janus Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Janus particles are widely sought for applications related to colloidal assembly, stabilization of emulsions, and development of active colloids, among others. Here we report a versatile route to the fabrication of well&#8208;controlled Janus particles by simply breaking the symmetry of spherical particles with swelling. When a polystyrene (PS) sphere covered by a rigid shell made of silica or polydopamine is exposed to a good solvent for PS, a gradually&#8208;increased pressure will be created inside the shell. If the pressure becomes high enough to poke a hole in the shell, the spherical symmetry will break while pushing out the swollen PS through the opening to generate a Janus particle comprised of two distinct components. One of the components is made of PS and its size is controlled by the extent of swelling. The other component is comprised of the rigid shell and remaining PS, with its overall diameter determined by the original PS sphere and the rigid shell. This solution&#8208;based route holds promises for the scalable production of complex Janus particles with a variety of compositions and in large quantities.</dc:description>

         <title>Biased Symmetry Breaking and Chiral Control by Self&#8208;Replicating in Achiral Tetradentate Platinum (II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of achiral platinum (II) complexes showed controllable biased symmetry breaking and circularly polarized luminescence in twisted grain boundary mesophase. Among them, the distorted geometry and twisted self&#8208;assembled nanobelts could be responsible for the intense optical activity (CD and CPL). Unprecedently, the handedness of LCs film can be inherited by self&#8208;replicating.







Abstract
Obtaining homochirality from biased symmetry&#8208;breaking of self&#8208;assembly in achiral molecules remains a great challenge due to the lack of ingenious strategies and controlling their handedness. Here, we report the first case of biased symmetry breaking from achiral platinum (II) liquid crystals which self&#8208;organize into an enantiomerically enriched single domain without selection of handedness in twist grain boundary TGB [*] phase. Most importantly, the chiral control of self&#8208;organization can be achieved by using above the homochiral liquid crystal films with determined handedness (P or M) as a template. Moreover, benefiting from self&#8208;assembled superhelix, these complexes exhibit prominent circularly polarized luminescence with high |glum| up to 3.4&#215;10&#8722;3 in the TGB [*] mesophase. This work paves a neoteric avenue for the development of chiral self&#8208;assemblies from achiral molecules.

         <title>Scalable Negishi Coupling between Organozinc Compounds and (Hetero)Aryl Bromides under Aerobic Conditions when using Bulk Water or Deep Eutectic Solvents with no Additional Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling runs across water and DES: Scalable Pd&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;couplings between (hetero)aryl bromides and organozinc halides have been developed either by using bulk water, or the choline chloride/urea eutectic mixture as a reaction medium. These processes proceed under mild conditions, short reaction times in air, in the absence of additional ligands, with high chemoselectivity and a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions between organozinc compounds and (hetero)aryl bromides have been reported when using bulk water as the reaction medium in the presence of NaCl or the biodegradable choline chloride/urea eutectic mixture. Both C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) and C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp2) couplings have been found to proceed smoothly, with high chemoselectivity, under mild conditions (room temperature or 60&#8201;&#176;C) in air, and in competition with protonolysis. Additional benefits include very short reaction times (20&#8197;s), good to excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%), wide substrate scope, and the tolerance of a variety of functional groups. The proposed novel protocol is scalable, and the practicability of the method is further highlighted by an easy recycling of both the catalyst and the eutectic mixture or water.

         <dc:description>
A diverse range of halogenation strategies using nickel have been developed over the past decade. This Minireview will cover six emerging strategies in this field including: oxidatively induced C&#8722;X reductive elimination, triflate&#8208;to&#8208;halogen exchange, directed C&#8722;H halogenation, non&#8208;directed electrophilic C&#8722;H halogenation, enantioselective &#945;&#8208;fluorination, and 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization&#8211;halogenation reactions including hydrohalogenation and carbohalogenation reactions.







Abstract
Nickel catalysis has demonstrated the capability of performing a broad range of synthetically challenging transformations over the last decade. Though recent literature has focused on the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds, a variety of breakthroughs in the field of C&#8722;X bond generation have also been reported. A diverse range of strategies using nickel have been developed, in an effort to expand the scope and synthetic utility of these halogenation methods. This Minireview will cover six emerging strategies in this field including: oxidatively induced C&#8722;X reductive elimination, triflate&#8208;to&#8208;halogen exchange reactions, directed C&#8722;H halogenation, non&#8208;directed electrophilic C&#8722;H halogenation of arenes, enantioselective &#945;&#8208;fluorination of carbonyl containing compounds, and 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization&#8208;halogenation reactions. The final section has been split into two parts: nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrohalogenation and nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbohalogenation reactions.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Disulfuration by a Chiral Bulky Three&#8208;Component Lewis Acid&#8208;Base</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis trio involving a bulky chiral primary amine, B(C6F5)3 and a bulky tertiary amine has been developed as an effective enamine catalyst for enantioselective disulfuration reactions. The chiral bulky Lewis trio (BLT) allows for the construction of chiral disulfides via direct disulfuration with &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyls or &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes in a practical and highly stereocontrolled manner.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component Lewis acid&#8211;base (Lewis trio) involving a bulky chiral primary amine, B(C6F5)3 and a bulky tertiary amine has been developed as an effective enamine catalyst for enantioselective disulfuration reactions. The bulky tertiary amine was found to activate a bulky primary&#8211;tertiary diamine&#8211;borane Lewis pair for enamine catalysis via frustrated interaction. The resulted chiral bulky Lewis trio (BLT) allows for the construction of chiral disulfides via direct disulfuration with &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyls or &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes in a practical and highly stereocontrolled manner.

         <title>A Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Harvesting Covalent Organic Framework Bearing Single Nickel Sites as a Highly Efficient Sulfur&#8211;Carbon Cross&#8208;Coupling Dual Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual catalyst (Ace&#8208;COF&#8208;Ni), which is composed of a photosensitive covalent organic framework and single nickel sites, is reported. This dual catalyst exhibits excellent visible&#8208;light and organometallic nickel synergistic catalytic performances for the sulfur&#8211;carbon cross&#8208;coupling reaction.







Abstract
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) have recently emerged as light&#8208;harvesting devices, as well as elegant heterogeneous catalysts. The combination of these two properties into a dual catalyst has not yet been explored. We report a new photosensitive triazine&#8208;based COF, decorated with single Ni sites to form a dual catalyst. This crystalline and highly porous catalyst shows excellent catalytic performance in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven catalytic sulfur&#8211;carbon cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Incorporation of single transition metal sites in a photosensitive COF scaffold with two&#8208;component synergistic catalyst in organic transformation is demonstrated for the first time.

         <title>Phthalocyanine as a Bioinspired Model for Chlorophyll f&#8208;Containing Photosystem&#8197;II Drives Photosynthesis into the Far&#8208;Red Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phthalocyanine chromophore absorbing in the far&#8208;red region with a tyrosine residue hydrogen bonded to an imidazole moiety provides the first example of a bioinspired model for the recent discovery that chlorophyll f&#8208;containing Photosystem II absorbing in the far&#8208;red limit at 727&#8197;nm can drive the four&#8208;electron water oxidation.







Abstract
The textbook explanation that P680 pigments are the red limit to drive oxygenic photosynthesis must be reconsidered by the recent discovery that chlorophyll f (Chlf)&#8208;containing Photosystem II (PSII) absorbing at 727&#8197;nm can drive water oxidation. Two different families of unsymmetrically substituted Zn phthalocyanines (Pc) absorbing in the 700&#8211;800&#8197;nm spectral window and containing a fused imidazole&#8208;phenyl substituent or a fused imidazole&#8208;hydroxyphenyl group have been synthetized and characterized as a bioinspired model of the Chlf/TyrosineZ/Histidine190 cofactors of PSII. Transient absorption studies in the presence of an electron acceptor and irradiating in the far&#8208;red region evidenced an intramolecular electron transfer process. Visible and FT&#8208;IR signatures indicate the formation of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded phenoxyl radical in ZnPc II&#8208;OH. This study sets the foundation for the utilization of a broader spectral window for multi&#8208;electronic catalytic processes with one of the most robust and efficient dyes.

         <title>Bimetallic Cooperative Catalysis for Decarbonylative Heteroarylation of Carboxylic Acids via C&#8208;O/C&#8208;H Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic cooperative catalysis is reported for the direct decarbonylative heteroarylation of carboxylic acids via acyl C&#8208;O/C&#8208;H coupling. The cooperative action of copper and palladium catalysts is exploited for chemoselective synthesis of heterobiaryl motifs. A broad substrate scope (&gt;70 examples) is accessible, including late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and streamlined synthesis of bioactive agents.







Abstract
Cooperative bimetallic catalysis is a fundamental approach in modern synthetic chemistry. We report bimetallic cooperative catalysis for the direct decarbonylative heteroarylation of ubiquitous carboxylic acids via acyl C&#8208;O/C&#8208;H coupling. This novel catalytic system exploits the cooperative action of a copper catalyst and a palladium catalyst in decarbonylation, which enables highly chemoselective synthesis of important heterobiaryl motifs through the coupling of carboxylic acids with heteroarenes in the absence of prefunctionalization or directing groups. This cooperative decarbonylative method uses common carboxylic acids and shows a remarkably broad substrate scope (&gt;70 examples), including late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and streamlined synthesis of bioactive agents. Extensive mechanistic and computational studies were conducted to gain insight into the mechanism of the reaction. The key step involves intersection of the two catalytic cycles via transmetallation of the copper&#8211;aryl species with the palladium(II) intermediate generated by oxidative addition/decarbonylation.

         <dc:description>A simple and general method is presented herein for the  in situ  preparations of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active microcrystals with a large luminescence dissymmetry factor  g  lum  , high fluorescence quantum efficiency (  &#934;  FL  ), wide emission color tenability, and well&#8208;ordered morphology. The reactions of pyridine&#8208;containing achiral molecules  1  &#8208;  7  with chiral camphor sulfonic acid ((+/&#8722;)&#8208;CSA) gave crystalline microplates formed by hydrogen bonding interactions between the protonated pyridinium units and the sulfonic anions. The chiral information of CSA are effectively transferred to the microcrystals by hydrogen bonding to afford full&#8208;color CPL from deep&#8208;blue to red with  g  lum  in the order of 10  &#8722;2  and  &#934;  FL  up to 80%. Moreover, organic microcrystals with high&#8208;performance white CPL (  &#934;  FL  = 46%; |  g  lum  | = 0.025) are achieved via the light&#8208;harvesting energy transfer between blue and yellow emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Large UV Solar&#8208;Blind&#8208;Region Phase&#8208;Matchable Optical Nonlinearity&#160;and Anisotropy in a &#960;&#8209;Conjugated Cation&#8208;Containing Phosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wide ultraviolet (UV) transparency, strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, and sufficient optical birefringence for phase&#8208;matching (PM) at short SHG wavelengths are three vital prerequisites for practical UV nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, simultaneously optimizing these properties remains a major challenge, particularly for metal phosphates, due to their competing requirements. Herein, we report a non&#8208;traditional &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation&#8208;based UV NLO phosphate [C(NH2)3]6(PO4)2&#183;3H2O (GPO) with a short UV cutoff edge. Remarkably, GPO is not only SHG active at 1064 nm (3.8 &#215; KH2PO4 @ 1064 nm) and 532 nm (0.3 &#215;  &#946;  &#8208;BaB2O4 @ 532 nm), but it also possesses the largest birefringence (0.078 @ 546 nm) among phosphates with a band gap exceeding 6.0 eV. The PM SHG capability of GPO can extend to 250 nm, indicating GPO is a promising UV solar&#8208;blind NLO material. Theoretical calculations and crystal structure analysis demonstrate that the rare coexistence of wide UV transparency, large SHG response and optical anisotropy can be attributed to the introduction of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated cations [C(NH2)3]+ and their favorable arrangement with [PO4]3&#8722; anions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular cascade (4+3) cyclocondensation of salicylaldehydes and vinylcyclopropanes is reported. A key feature of the reaction is the use of a phosphonate group as an acceptor moiety on the cyclopropane, exploiting its propensity to undergo olefination with aldehydes. Subsequent O&#8208;allylation allowed the formation of a range of substituted benzoxepines. Employing a novel chiral ligand, the products could be obtained in generally very good yield and with reasonable enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report herein the asymmetric total synthesis of norzoanthamine using radical reactions as key steps for rapid access to the congested carbocyclic core, which was the major synthetic challenge for most of zoanthamine alkoids. (1) The Ueno&#8211;Stork radical cyclization was applied to construct the adjacent quaternary centers at C&#8208;9 and C&#8208;22 positions; (2) a Co&#8208;catalyzed HAT radical reaction was successfully applied to construct the quaternary center at C&#8208;12 via Csp3&#8208;Csp2 bond formation; (3) a Mn&#8208;catalyzed HAT radical reaction was used to stereospecifically reduce the tetra&#8208;substituted olefin (C13=C18) and install the contiguous stereocenters in proximity to the quaternary center. A one&#8208;pot bio&#8208;inspired cyclization step was finally applied to forge the unstable bis&#8208;amino acetal skeleton. Our approach can precisely control the stereochemistry of seven vicinal stereocenters and effectively construct the highly congested heptacyclic skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>Prodrug Activation by Gold Artificial Metalloenzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Phenanthridinium Derivatives via Hydroamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold artificial metalloenzyme catalyzes the conversion of a prodrug into a phenanthridinium&#8208;based anticancer drug with a good turnover number (&gt;100) via hydroamination under mild conditions. The gold artificial metalloenzyme successfully triggers drug synthesis to achieve cancer therapy in cell&#8208;based assays.







Abstract
An emerging approach in the field of targeted drug delivery is the establishment of abiotic metal&#8208;triggered prodrug mechanisms that can control the release of bioactive drugs. Currently, the design of prodrugs that use abiotic metals as a trigger relies heavily on uncaging strategies. Here, we introduce a strategy based on the gold&#8208;catalyzed activation of a phenanthridinium&#8208;based prodrug via hydroamination under physiological conditions. To make the prodrug strategy biocompatible, a gold artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) based on human serum albumin, rather than the free gold metal complex, was used as a trigger for prodrug activation. The albumin&#8208;based gold ArM protected the catalytic activity of the bound gold metal even in the presence of up to 1&#8197;mM glutathione in vitro. The drug synthesized via the gold ArM exerted a therapeutic effect in cell&#8208;based assays, highlighting the potential usefulness of the gold ArM in anticancer applications.

         <title>Optical Manipulation of Subcellular Protein Translocation Using a Photoactivatable Covalent Labeling System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivatable chemically induced dimerization (photo&#8208;CID) system based on covalent protein&#8208;labeling technologies was developed by rationally designing a new caged ligand. This photo&#8208;CID system enabled light&#8208;induced protein translocation from the cytoplasm to subcellular regions such as the nucleus, mitochondrial outer membrane, and plasma membrane. Furthermore, quick protein translocation into a laser&#8208;illuminated subcellular microregion was achieved.







Abstract
The photoactivatable chemically induced dimerization (photo&#8208;CID) technique for tag&#8208;fused proteins is one of the most promising methods for regulating subcellular protein translocations and protein&#8211;protein interactions. However, light&#8208;induced covalent protein dimerization in living cells has yet to be established, despite its various advantages. Herein, we developed a photoactivatable covalent protein&#8208;labeling technology by applying a caged ligand to the BL&#8208;tag system, a covalent protein labeling system that uses mutant &#946;&#8208;lactamase. We further developed CBHD, a caged protein dimerizer, using caged BL&#8208;tag and HaloTag ligands, and achieved light&#8208;induced protein translocation from the cytoplasm to subcellular regions. In addition, this covalent photo&#8208;CID system enabled quick protein translocation to a laser&#8208;illuminated microregion. These results indicate that the covalent photo&#8208;CID system will expand the scope of CID applications in the optical manipulation of cellular functions.

Abstract
We investigated the folding kinetics of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures by comparing the K+&#8208;induced folding of an RNA G4 derived from the human telomeric repeat&#8208;containing RNA (TERRA25) with a sequence homologous DNA G4 (wtTel25) using CD spectroscopy and real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy. While DNA G4 folding is biphasic, reveals kinetic partitioning and involves kinetically favoured off&#8208;pathway intermediates, RNA G4 folding is faster and monophasic. The differences in kinetics are correlated to the differences in the folded conformations of RNA vs. DNA G4s, in particular with regard to the conformation around the glycosidic torsion angle &#967; that uniformly adopts anti conformations for RNA G4s and both, syn and anti conformation for DNA G4s. Modified DNA G4s with 19F bound to C2&#8242; in arabino configuration adopt exclusively anti conformations for &#967;. These fluoro&#8208;modified DNA (antiTel25) reveal faster folding kinetics and monomorphic conformations similar to RNA G4s, suggesting the correlation between folding kinetics and pathways with differences in &#967; angle preferences in DNA and RNA, respectively.

         <title>Dual Active Sites on Molybdenum/ZSM&#8208;5 Catalyst for Methane Dehydroaromatization: Insights from Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional acidic proton&#8208;carburized Mo active site in Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite was revealed by probing their spatial proximity using double&#8208;resonance solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The spatial interaction of the dual site governs the activity of the catalyst for MDA reaction.







Abstract
Methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) on Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite catalyst is promising for direct transformation of natural gas. Understanding the nature of active sites on Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 is a challenge for applications. Herein, using 1H{95Mo} double&#8208;resonance solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, we identify proximate dual active sites on Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst by direct observation of internuclear spatial interaction between Br&#248;nsted acid site and Mo species in zeolite channels. The acidic proton&#8211;Mo spatial interaction is correlated with methane conversion and aromatics formation in the MDA process, an important factor in determining the catalyst activity and lifetime. The evolution of olefins and aromatics in Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 channels is monitored by detecting their host&#8211;guest interactions with both active Mo sites and Br&#248;nsted acid sites via 1H{95Mo} double&#8208;resonance and two&#8208;dimensional 1H&#8211;1H correlation NMR spectroscopy, revealing the intermediate role of olefins in hydrocarbon pool process during the MDA reaction.

         <title>Dense&#8208;Stacking Porous Conjugated Polymer as Reactive&#8208;Type Host for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dense&#8208;stacking hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) porous polymer is reported. The compact polymer/S cathode (ca. 15&#8197;mgs&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 200&#8208;&#956;m thickness) presents a low cathode porosity of 41&#8201;% and high areal capacity (&gt;10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in a lean electrolyte of 5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1. The lithiation/delithiation of HATN polymer by Li2Sx facilitates the formation of intimately bound nanostructured Li2S/S on the bulky polymer host, leading to fast Li2S/S kinetics.







Abstract
Commercialization of the lithium&#8208;sulfur battery is hampered by bottlenecks like low sulfur loading, high cathode porosity, uncontrollable Li2Sx deposition and sluggish kinetics of Li2S activation. Herein, we developed a densely stacked redox&#8208;active hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) polymer with a surface area of 302&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a very high bulk density of ca. 1.60&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3. Uniquely, HATN polymer has a similar redox potential window to S, which facilitates the binding of Li2Sx and its transformation chemistry within the bulky polymer host, leading to fast Li2S/S kinetics. The compact polymer/S electrode presents a high sulfur loading of ca. 15&#8197;mgs&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (200&#8208;&#956;m thickness) with a low cathode porosity of 41&#8201;%. It delivers a high areal capacity of ca. 14&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and good cycling stability (200&#8197;cycles) at electrolyte&#8211;sulfur (E/S) ratio of 5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mgs&#8722;1. The assembled pouch cell delivers a cell&#8208;level high energy density of 303&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 392&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1.

         <title>Chiral Amplification of Phosphoramidates of Amines and Amino Acids in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of homochirality is a fundamental scientific question. We show that dissolution behavior of racemic and enantiopure amines can be altered by conversion into phosphoramidates. Stirring a solid scalemic mixture in water leads to enantioenrichment of the solution phase (&gt;90&#8201;% ee). Amplification of amino acids and their derivatives show that phosphorylation can serve as a potentially viable source of prebiotic homochirality.







Abstract
The origin of biomolecular homochirality continues to be one of the most fascinating aspects of prebiotic chemistry. Various amplification strategies for chiral compounds to enhance a small chiral preference have been reported, but none of these involves phosphorylation, one of nature's essential chemical reactions. Here we present a simple and robust concept of phosphorylation&#8208;based chiral amplification of amines and amino acids in water. By exploiting the difference in solubility of a racemic phosphoramidate and its enantiopure form, we achieved enantioenrichment in solution. Starting with near racemic, phenylethylamine&#8208;based phosphoramidates, ee's of up to 95&#8201;% are reached in a single amplification step. Particularly noteworthy is the enantioenrichment of phosphorylated amino acids and their derivatives, which might point to a potential role of phosphorus en&#8208;route to prebiotic homochirality.

         <title>Alkylidene Meldrum's Acids as Platforms for the Vinylogous Synthesis of Dihydropyranones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disubstituted alkylidene Meldrum's acids proved to be novel C4&#8208;synthons capable of undergoing a vinylogous formal (4+2) cycloaddition reaction with reactive ketones, providing an unprecedented route to chiral 3,6&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones under Br&#248;nsted base organocatalytic conditions.







Abstract
Upon Br&#248;nsted base organocatalysis, ketone&#8208;derived alkylidene Meldrum's acids proved to be competent vinylogous platforms able to undergo a formal (4+2) cycloaddition reaction with dihydro&#8208;2,3&#8208;furandione, providing an unprecedented route to 3,6&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones as spiro[4.5]decane derivatives with up to 98&#8201;% ee thanks to the commercially available Takemoto catalyst. Preliminary investigation showed that this reaction could be extended to other activated ketones, establishing these alkylidene Meldrum's acids as a novel C4&#8208;synthon in the vinylogous series.

&lt;p&gt;Disubstituted alkylidene Meldrum's acids proved to be novel C4&#8208;synthons capable of undergoing a vinylogous formal (4+2) cycloaddition reaction with reactive ketones, providing an unprecedented route to chiral 3,6&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones under Br&#248;nsted base organocatalytic conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon Br&#248;nsted base organocatalysis, ketone&#8208;derived alkylidene Meldrum's acids proved to be competent vinylogous platforms able to undergo a formal (4+2) cycloaddition reaction with dihydro&#8208;2,3&#8208;furandione, providing an unprecedented route to 3,6&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones as spiro[4.5]decane derivatives with up to 98&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; thanks to the commercially available Takemoto catalyst. Preliminary investigation showed that this reaction could be extended to other activated ketones, establishing these alkylidene Meldrum's acids as a novel C4&#8208;synthon in the vinylogous series.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Copper&#8208;DNAzyme Nanohybrids for Dual&#8208;Catalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great efforts of using DNAzyme for gene therapy, its clinical success is limited by the lack of simple in&#8208;vivo delivery systems and limited anticancer efficacy. Here, we develop a simple approach for the synthesis of hybrid nanostructures that exclusively consists of catalytic DNAzyme and Cu  2+  with ultra&#8208;high loading capacity. The engineered Cu&#8208;DNAzyme system allows to effectively co&#8208;deliver DNAzyme and Cu  2+  into cancer cells for combinational catalytic therapy to fight against tumors. The released Cu  2+  can be reduced to Cu  +  by intracellular glutathione and then catalyze endogenous H2O2 to form cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals for chemodynamic therapy (CDT), while the 10&#8208;23 DNAzyme enables the catalytic cleavage of VEGFR2 mRNA and activates gene silencing for gene therapy. We demonstrate that the hybrid system can efficiently accumulate in the tumor and exhibit amplified cascade antitumor effects with negligible systemic toxicity. Our work paves an extremely simple way to integrate DNAzyme&#8208;based gene therapy with CDT for the dual&#8208;catalytic tumor treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Designer Anticancer Nanoprodrugs with Self&#8208;Toxification Activity Realized by Acid&#8208;triggered Biodegradation and In&#8197;Situ Fragment Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new paradigm of nanoprodrugs with a degradation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;toxification design is introduced. Organic&#8208;modified hollow silica/Pd(OH)2 nanocomposites are constructed for pH&#8208;responsive biodegradation and subsequent in&#8197;situ complexation of the predesigned molecular fragments into cytotoxic complexes, thereby fulfilling effective cancer therapy by turning degradation by&#8208;products into therapeutics without using conventional chemodrugs.







Abstract
Prodrugs that allow in&#8197;situ chemical conversion of less toxic precursors into active drugs in response to certain stimuli are promising anticancer candidates. Herein, we present a novel design of nanoprodrugs with a &#8220;degradation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;toxification&#8221; strategy, which realizes intracellular synthesis of anticancer agents using the nanoparticles&#8217; own degradation fragments as the precursors. To fulfill this concept, a metal complexing dicyclohexylphosphine (DCP) organosilane is carefully screened out from various ligands to conjugate onto Pd(OH)2 nanodots confined hollow silica nanospheres (PD&#8208;HSN). This constructed nanoprodrug shows acid&#8208;triggered degradation in lysosomes and neutralizes protons to induce lysosomes rupturing, generating predesigned less toxic fragments (Pd2+ and DCP&#8208;silicates) that complex into DCP/Pd complex in&#8197;situ for inducing DNA damage, leading to enhanced anticancer activity against various cancer cell lines as well as in a xenograft tumour model.

         <title>Liposomes as Carriers of Membrane&#8208;Associated Proteins and Peptides for Mass Spectrometric Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liposomes as carriers of proteins and peptides enable investigation of lipid clusters, protein oligomers and protein&#8211;lipid interactions in mass spectrometric analysis. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202101242), Carla Schmidt et&#8197;al. show that proteoliposomes dissociate in the gas&#8208;phase of a mass spectrometer, releasing associated proteins or peptides. This new approach shows that liposomes can be used to study proteins and peptides as well as their interactions with lipids.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic field stimulated&#160;photocatalytic N2 fixation over defective BaTiO3&#160;perovskites is described by Ming Feng, Haibo Li, Zhongwei Chen and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202100726). The electromagnetic synergistic effect promotes&#160;N2 adsorption and activation while facilitating fast charge separation under UV/Vis irradiation. This study offers an alternative route for exploring photocatalytic N2 fixation materials.

         <title>One&#8208;step Ethylene Purification from an Acetylene/Ethylene/Ethane Ternary Mixture by Cyclopentadiene Cobalt&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CpCo group was introduced in a cubic cage to generate a sphere&#8208;like force surface, thus dividing the cubic cage into two parts. Gas molecules have to pass the sphere&#8208;like force surface twice, which increases the interaction probability between gas and framework. Based on the high selectivity of the CpCo group high&#8208;purity ethylene is obtained from an acetylene/ethylene/ethane ternary mixture, as reported by Daofeng Sun et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202100782).

         <title>Polymorphism in Squaraine Dye Aggregates by Self&#8208;Assembly Pathway Differentiation: Panchromatic Tubular Dye Nanorods versus J&#8208;Aggregate Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular polymorphism for bis(squaraine) dye aggregates is described by David Bialas, Kazunori Sugiyasu, Frank W&#252;rthner and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102183). This bis(squaraine) self&#8208;assembles into helical nanorods in solution upon rapid cooling, while slow cooling results in thermodynamically stable nanosheet structures. The two polymorphs exhibit entirely different UV/Vis/NIR absorption properties with panchromatic features for the nanorods, while a narrow, bathochromically shifted J&#8208;band is observed for the nanosheets.

&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular polymorphism for bis(squaraine) dye aggregates is described by David Bialas, Kazunori Sugiyasu, Frank W&#252;rthner and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202102183"&gt;10.1002/anie.202102183&lt;/a&gt;). This bis(squaraine) self&#8208;assembles into helical nanorods in solution upon rapid cooling, while slow cooling results in thermodynamically stable nanosheet structures. The two polymorphs exhibit entirely different UV/Vis/NIR absorption properties with panchromatic features for the nanorods, while a narrow, bathochromically shifted J&#8208;band is observed for the nanosheets.

         <title>Novel Insight into Proximal DNA Domain Interactions from Temperature&#8208;Controlled Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quadruplexes are non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid structures essential for many cellular processes. Hybrid quadruplex&#8208;duplex oligonucleotide assemblies comprised of multiple domains are challenging to study with conventional biophysical methods due to their structural complexity. Here, we introduce a novel method based on native mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with a custom&#8208;built temperature&#8208;controlled nanoelectrospray ionization (TCnESI) source designed to investigate interactions between proximal DNA domains. Thermal denaturation experiments were planned to observe unfolding of multi&#8208;stranded oligonucleotide constructs derived from biologically relevant structures and to identify unfolding intermediates. Using the TCnESI MS, we observed changes in  T  m  and thermodynamic characteristics of proximal DNA domains depending on the number of domains, their position, and order in a single experiment.</dc:description>

         <title>Distinct Sustainable Carbon Nanodots Enable Free Radical Photopolymerization, Photo&#8208;ATRP and Photo&#8208;CuAAC Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven processes based on sustainable materials originating from different biomass such as citric acid in lemon, alginate in seaweed or lac dye in Kerria lacca have received increased attention to make carbon nanodots (CDs). It enables initiation of radical photopolymerization with visible light. CDs have taken the offer to make tailor&#8208;made polymeric materials by sensitization of Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed ATRP resulting in small dispersities following classical ATRP and CuACC click chemistry, as reported by Zhijun Chen, Bernd Strehmel et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202015677).

         <title>A Simple Biomimetic Receptor Selectively Recognizing the GlcNAc2 Disaccharide in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Think simple. In the development of biomimetic receptors for carbohydrates, an approach that focuses on simple acyclic architectures can be successfully exploited for disaccharide recognition, provided that the correct binding geometry can be achieved. Here we present a simple tweezers&#8208;shaped receptor that selectively recognizes in water GlcNAc2, the core fragment of N&#8208;glycans exposed on the surface of enveloped viruses, such as coronaviruses.







Abstract
GlcNAc2 is the core disaccharide fragment present in N&#8208;glycans exposed on the surface of enveloped viruses of high health concern, such as coronaviruses. Because N&#8208;glycans are directly involved in the docking of viruses to host cells, recognition of GlcNAc2 by a biomimetic receptor may be a convenient alternative to the use of lectins to interfere with viral entry and infection. Herein, we describe a simple biomimetic receptor recognizing the methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glycoside of GlcNAc2 in water with an unprecedented affinity of 160&#8197;&#956;M, exceeding that of more structurally complex receptors reported in the literature. The tweezers&#8208;shaped acyclic structure exhibits marked selectivity among structurally related disaccharides, and complete discrimination between mono&#8208; and disaccharides. Molecular modelling calculations supported by NOE data provided a three&#8208;dimensional description of the binding mode, shedding light on the origin of the affinities and selectivities exhibited by the receptor.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved and Comprehensive Analysis of Surface Glycoproteins Reveals Distinct Responses of Monocytes and Macrophages to Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycoproteins on the surface of monocytes and macrophages were systematically quantified during the bacterial infection. The time&#8208;resolved analysis revealed transient changes and differential remodeling of these glycoproteins on both types of cells. Novel surface glycoproteins participating in the immune response were discovered, and site&#8208;specific glycosylation changes were identified.







Abstract
Glycoproteins on the surface of immune cells play extremely important roles in response to pathogens. Yet, a systematic and time&#8208;resolved investigation of surface glycoproteins during the immune response remains to be explored. Integrating selective enrichment of surface glycoproteins with multiplexed proteomics, we globally and site&#8208;specifically quantified the dynamics of surface glycoproteins on THP&#8208;1 monocytes and macrophages in response to bacterial infection and during the monocyte&#8208;to&#8208;macrophage differentiation. The time&#8208;resolved analysis reveals transient changes and differential remodeling of surface glycoproteins on both cell types, and potential upstream regulators and downstream effects of the regulated glycoproteins. Besides, we identified novel surface glycoproteins participating in the immune response such as APMAP, and site&#8208;specific changes of glycoproteins.

&lt;p&gt;Glycoproteins on the surface of monocytes and macrophages were systematically quantified during the bacterial infection. The time&#8208;resolved analysis revealed transient changes and differential remodeling of these glycoproteins on both types of cells. Novel surface glycoproteins participating in the immune response were discovered, and site&#8208;specific glycosylation changes were identified.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycoproteins on the surface of immune cells play extremely important roles in response to pathogens. Yet, a systematic and time&#8208;resolved investigation of surface glycoproteins during the immune response remains to be explored. Integrating selective enrichment of surface glycoproteins with multiplexed proteomics, we globally and site&#8208;specifically quantified the dynamics of surface glycoproteins on THP&#8208;1 monocytes and macrophages in response to bacterial infection and during the monocyte&#8208;to&#8208;macrophage differentiation. The time&#8208;resolved analysis reveals transient changes and differential remodeling of surface glycoproteins on both cell types, and potential upstream regulators and downstream effects of the regulated glycoproteins. Besides, we identified novel surface glycoproteins participating in the immune response such as APMAP, and site&#8208;specific changes of glycoproteins. This study provides unprecedented information to deepen our understanding of glycoproteins and cellular activities.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Meroterpenoid Manginoid&#8197;A as Fueled by a Challenging Pinacol Coupling and Bicycle&#8208;forming Etherification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manginoids are a unique collection of bioactive natural products whose structures fuse an oxa&#8208;bridged spirocyclohexanedione with a trans&#8208;hydrindane framework. Such architectures can be accessed through a strategy combining a challenging pinacol coupling and bicycle&#8208;forming etherification with several additional regioselective reactions. As a result, a 19 step total synthesis of manginoid&#8197;A has been achieved.







Abstract
The manginoids are a unique collection of bioactive natural products whose structures fuse an oxa&#8208;bridged spirocyclohexanedione with a heavily substituted trans&#8208;hydrindane framework. Herein, we show that such architectures can be accessed through a strategy combining a challenging pinacol coupling and bicycle&#8208;forming etherification with several additional chemo&#8208; and regioselective reactions. The success of these key events proved to be highly substrate and condition specific, affording insights for their application to other targets. As a result, not only has a 19&#8208;step total synthesis of manginoid&#8197;A been achieved, but a potential roadmap to access other members of the family and related natural products has also been identified.

         <dc:description>A two&#8208;step sequence for the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of exclusively alkyl&#8208;substituted acyclic allylic systems with a stereocenter in the allylic position is reported.

         <title>Tuneable control over organocatalytic activity through host guest chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic regulation of chemical reactivity is important in many complex chemical reaction networks such as cascade reactions and signal transduction processes. Signal responsive catalysts could play a crucial role in regulating these reaction pathways, a concept that is universal to controlling reactions networks by enzymatic catalysis in nature. However, synthetic catalysts with controllable activity are rare. Recently, supramolecular encapsulation was reported to regulate the activities of artificial catalysts. However, most of these examples focus on transition metal catalysts and often have highly specialized designs to enable complex formation with the host molecules. Here, we present a host&#8208;guest chemistry based strategy to modulate the activity of commercially available synthetic organocatalysts. The molecular container cucurbit[7]uril was successfully applied to change the activity of four different organocatalysts and one initiator, enabling up&#8208; or down&#8208;regulation of the reaction rates of four different classes of chemical reactions. Where CB[7] encapsulation in most cases results in catalyst inhibition, in one case we observe catalyst activation by binding to CB[7]. The mechanism behind this unexpected behavior was explored by NMR binding studies and p  K  a measurements. In most of the catalysts or initiator regulated by CB[7], the addition of a stronger binding signal molecule liberates the catalysts and restores the catalytic activity to the original value. Moreover, we can instantaneously switch the catalytic activity during operation, by addition of either supramolecular host or competitive binding molecules, and predict the reaction rate with a kinetic model. Overall, this signal responsive system proves a promising tool to control catalytic activity, constituting a step towards the design and application of chemical reaction networks that respond to environmental triggers.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemiluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer Efficiency and Donor&#8211;Acceptor Distance: from Qualitative to Quantitative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since its birth in 1967, the utilization of chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) has made substantial progress in a variety of fields for its unique features. However, the quantitative relationship between CRET efficiency and donor&#8211;acceptor distance has not yet been determined owing to the difficulty in designing the variable lengths between chemiluminescent donors and acceptors. Herein, we synthesized three kinds of tetraphenylethene (TPE)&#8208;anchored cationic surfactants with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics. For the first time, it is quantitatively demonstrated that the CRET efficiency is inversely proportional to the sixth power of distance between luminol donors and TPE acceptors. The details disclosed in this contribute have provided the solid evidence that CRET follows F&#246;rster resonance theory. Our strategy would build a promising platform to control donor&#8211;acceptor distance, allowing to the interdisciplinary applications of CRET.</dc:description>

         <title>Supported Pd2 Dual&#8208;atom Site Catalyst for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;atom site catalysts (DACs) have emerged as a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis because the synergistic effect between adjacent metal atoms can promote their catalytic activity while maintaining the advantages of single&#8208;atom site catalysts (SACs), like 100% atomic utilization efficiency and excellent selectivity. Herein, a supported Pd 2  DAC was synthesized and used for electrochemical CO 2  reduction reaction (CO 2  RR) for the first time. The as&#8208;obtained Pd 2  DAC exhibited superior CO 2  RR catalytic performance with 98.2% FE CO  at &#8208;0.85 V vs. RHE, far exceeding that of Pd 1  SAC, and coupled with long&#8208;term stability. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the intrinsic reason for the superior activity of Pd 2  DAC toward CO 2  RR was the electron transfer between Pd atoms at the dimeric Pd sites. Thus, Pd 2  DAC possessed moderate adsorption strength of CO*, which was beneficial for CO production in CO 2  RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Hydrolysis En Route to Corroles with Increased Druglikeness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heme&#8208;like metal&#8208;chelating macrocycles, including expanded and contracted porphyrins, are of everlasting interest as drug candidates for numerous diseases. Still, all reported corrole derivatives (and most other heme analogs) do not fulfill the most basic standards expected for oral drug administration: a combination of low molecular weight and reasonable water solubility. We now disclose a very facile synthetic methodology that relies on surprisingly easy trifluoromethyl hydrolysis for gaining access to a new class of corroles that do satisfy all druglikeness criteria. The relevance is briefly exemplified for the iron corroles by demonstrating the ability to affect their association to plasma proteins and their performance for catalase&#8208;like decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Sampling and analysis in flow: the keys to smarter, more controllable and sustainable fine&#8208;chemical manufacturing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Process analytical technology (PAT) is a system designed to help chemists better understand and control manufacturing processes. PAT systems operate through the combination of analytical devices, reactor control elements, and mathematical models to ensure the quality of the final product  via  a quality by design (QbD) approach. The expansion of continuous manufacturing in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industry involves the development of PAT tools suitable for continuous operation and flow reactor environment. This requires innovative approaches to sampling and analysis from flowing media to maintain the integrity of the reactor content and the analyte of interest. The following review discusses examples of PAT tools implemented in flow chemistry for the preparation of small organic molecules, and applications of self&#8208;optimisation tools.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Counting and Superresolution Mapping of Tetraspanins on Exosomes using a Single&#8208;Molecule Sensitive Flow Technique and Transistor&#8208;like Semiconducting Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we describes a method for high&#8208;throughput counting and superresolution mapping of surface proteins on exosomes, using a combination of a single&#8208;molecule sensitive flow technique and an adaptive superresolution imaging method. Exosomes stained with membrane dye and dye&#8208;conjugated antibodies were analyzed using a microfluidic platform at a flow rate of 100 exosome/s to determine size and protein copy number. Superresolution mapping was performed with exosomes labeled with novel transistor&#8208;like, semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots), which exhibit spontaneous blinking with &lt;5 nm localization error and a broad range of optical&#8208;adjustable duty cycles. Based on the copy numbers extracted from the flow analysis, the switch&#8208;on frequency of the Pdots were fine adjusted so that structures of hundreds of exosomes can be obtained within five minutes. The high throughput and high sensitivity of this method offer clear advantages for characterization of exosomes and similar biological vesicles.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Non&#8208;Fused Electron Acceptors Leading to Efficient Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the remarkable progress being achieved in recent years, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) still need working to approach the balance among the efficiency&#8208;stability&#8208;cost correlation. Herein, two fully non&#8208;fused electron acceptors, PTB4F and PTB4Cl are developed via two&#8208;step synthesis from single aromatic units. The introduction of two&#8208;dimensional chain and halogenated terminals for these non&#8208;fused acceptors plays synergistic roles in optimizing their solid stacking and orientation, thus promoting an elongated exciton lifetime and fast charge transfer rate in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends. As results, PTB4Cl, upon blending with PBDB&#8208;TF polymer, has enabled single&#8208;junction OPVs with power conversion efficiencies of 12.76%, representing the highest values among the reported fully non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors so far.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Polymer&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Electrolyte and Fully Infiltrated 3D Electrode for Integrated Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs) are very promising due to their enhanced safety and high energy density, but greatly plagued by the relatively low ionic conductivity of solid&#8208;state electrolytes and large electrolyte&#8208;electrode interfacial resistance. Herein, we design a&#160;poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP)&#8208;based polymer&#8208;in&#8208;salt solid electrolyte (PISSE) with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity (1.24&#215;10  &#8208;4  S cm  &#8208;1  ) and construct a model integrated TiO  2  /Li SSLB with 3D fully infiltration of solid electrolyte. With forming aggregated ion clusters, unique ionic channels are generated in the PISSE, providing much faster Li  +  transport than common polymer electrolytes. Moreover, the integrated device simultaneously achieves maximized interfacial contact and electrochemical and mechanical stability, presenting high performance close to that with liquid electrolyte. A pouch cell made of 2 SSLB units in series shows high voltage plateau (3.7 V) and volumetric energy density comparable to many commercial thin&#8208;film batteries (microbatteries), which also exhibits robust flexibility and brilliant safety under abuse tests.</dc:description>

         <title>Transformable Nanosensitizer with Tumour Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Sonodynamic Process and Calcium Release for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the promise of sonodynamic process in cancer therapy, existing sonosensitizers often fail to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) against tumor, potentially leading to off&#8208;target toxicity to normal tissues. Herein, we report a transformable core&#8208;shell nanosonosensitizer (TiO  2  @CaP) that not only reinvigorates the ROS generation but also dissolves its CaP shell to release Ca  2+  in acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) under ultrasound activation. Thus, TiO  2  @CaP acts as the smart nanosonosensitizer that specifically induces mitochondrial dysfunction via overloading intracellular Ca  2+  ions to synergize with sonodynamic process in TME. Such a synergetic effect of TME&#8208;activated sonodynamic ROS generation and Ca  2+  release is revealed to substantially enhance immunogenic cell death, resulting in enhanced T cell recruitment and infiltration into the immunogenetic cold tumor (4T1). In conjunction with checkpoint blockade therapy (anti&#8208;PD 1), TiO  2  @CaP&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy elicits systemic anti&#8208;tumor immunity, leading to regression of non&#8208;treated distant tumors and inhibition of lung metastasis. This work thus paves the way to develop &#8220;smart&#8221; TME&#8208;activatable sonosensitizer with tempospatial control over antitumor responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Thermal Energy Storage Using a Hybrid Hypercrosslinked Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method enables the encapsulation of organic and inorganic phase change materials (PCMs) simultaneously has not been reported though a range of research has been dedicated to solving the leakage problems of PCMs during energy storage process. In this work, an organic/inorganic hybrid silioxyl functional group containing polymer was synthesized and applied to encapsulate PCMs. Owing to the mild hypercrosslinking reaction conditions, which only require the addition of catalytic amount of aqueous alkali solution, renders it to be tolerance towards both organic and inorganic PCMs. It is noteworthy that the initial homogeneous state of the reaction mixture allowed the ultimate PCMs encapsulation rate and the uniform blending of the third nano&#8208;additives with the aim of thermal conductivity enhancement. Further study reveals that the presence of this hybrid polymers endows a unique self&#8208;cleaning property to the obtained phase change composite that it displays a good hydrophobicity to water droplets. More importantly, this novel PCMs encapsulation protocol displays good tolerance towards varies of nanoparticles, including carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, metal oxide nanoparticles and inorganic oxide nanoparticles, which enables an utmost 600% thermal conductivity enhancement and 93.7% light&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency with a latent heat of 180 J/g without leakage.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;term tracking and dynamically quantifying of reversible changes of extracellular Ca2+ in multiple brain regions of freely moving animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding physiological and pathological processes in the brain requires tracking the reversible changes in chemical signals with long&#8208;term stability. We developed a new anti&#8208;biofouling microfiber array to real&#8208;time quantify extracellular Ca 2+  concentrations together with neuron activity across many regions in the mammalian brain for 60 days, in which the signal degradation was &lt; &#8764;8%. The developed microarray with high tempo&#8208;spatial resolution (&#8764;10 &#956;m, &#8764;1.3 s) was implanted into 7 brain regions of free&#8208;moving mice for monitoring the reversible changes of extracellular Ca 2+  upon ischemia&#8208;reperfusion processes. It was discovered that the changing sequence and rate of Ca 2+  in 7 brain regions were different during the stroke. We also found that ROS scavenger could protect Ca 2+  influx and neuronal activity after stroke, suggesting the significant influence of ROS on Ca 2+  overload and neuron death. Finally, we demonstrated this microarray is a versatile tool for investigating brain dynamic during pathological processes and drug treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Pinning Effect Enhanced Structural Stability toward a Zero&#8208;Strain Layered Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered oxides as the cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries are receiving extensive attention due to their high capacity and flexible composition. However, the layered cathode tends to be thermodynamically and electrochemically unstable during sodiation and de&#8208;sodiation. Herein, we for the first time propose the &#8220;pinning effect&#8221; and controllable &#8220;pinning point&#8221; in sodium storage layered cathodes to enhance the structural stability and achieve the optimal electrochemical performance. 0%, 2.5% and 7.3% transition&#8208;metal (TM) occupancies in Na&#8208;site as pinning points are obtained through adjusting the feeding ratio of iron in Na  0.67  Mn  0.5  Co  0.5&#8208;  x  Fe  x  O  2  system. Results show that 2.5% TM pinning is beneficial to restrain the potential slab sliding and enhance the structural stability, resulting in an ultra&#8208;low volume variation of 0.6% and maintaining the smooth two&#8208;dimensional channel for Na&#8208;ion transfer. Finally, the Na  0.67  Mn  0.5  Co  0.4  Fe  0.1  O  2  cathode with the optimal TM pinning delivers outstanding cycling performance of over 1000 cycles and superior rate capability up to 10C.</dc:description>

         <title>Na&#8230;B Bond in NaBH3&#8211;: Solving the Conundrum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bonding in the recently synthesized NaBH  3  &#8211;  cluster is investigated using the high level Valence Bond BOVB method. Contrary to earlier conclusions, the Na&#8211;B bond is found to be neither a genuine dative bond, nor a standard polar&#8208;covalent bond at equilibrium. It is rather revealed as a split and polarized weakly coupled electron&#8208;pair, which allows this cluster to be more effectively stabilized by a combination of (major) dipole&#8208;dipole electrostatic interaction and (secondary) resonant one&#8208;electron bonding mechanism. Our analysis of this unprecedented bonding situation extends to similar clusters, and the VB model unifies and articulates the previously published variegated views on this exotic &#8220;bond&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Color Switchable Photonic Crystal Silicone Elastomer Kirigami</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioinspired dynamic structural color has great potential for use in dynamic displays, sensors, cryptography, and camouflage. However, it is quite rare for artificial structural color devices to withstand thousands of cycles. Male hummingbird&#8217;s crowns and gorgets are brightly colored, demonstrating color switching frequently that is induced by regulating the orientation of the feathers through movement of skin or joint. Inspired by this unique structural color modulation, we demonstrate a flexible, mechanically triggered color switchable sheet based on a photonic crystal&#8208; (PhC) coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) kirigami (PhC&#8208;PDMS kirigami) made by laser cutting. Finite element modeling (FEM) simulation reveals that the thickness of PDMS kirigami and the chamfer at the incision induced by laser cutting both dominate the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane deformation through in&#8208;plane stretching. The bioinspired PhC&#8208;PDMS kirigami shows precisely programmable structural color and keeps the color very well after recycling over 10,000 times. This bioinspired PhC&#8208;PDMS kirigami also shows excellent viewability even in bright sunlight, high readability, robust functionality, technical flexibility, and mechanical durability, which are readily exploitable for applications, such as chromic mechanical monitors for the sports industry or for medical applications, wearable camouflage, and security systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reductive Carbo&#8208;Carboxylation of Alkenes with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reductive carboxylation of organo (pseudo)halides with CO  2  is a powerful method to provide carboxylic acids quickly. Notably, the catalytic reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons via CO  2  fixation is a highly challenging but desirable approach for structurally diverse carboxylic acids. However, there are only a few reports but no examples of alkenes via transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Herein, we report the first asymmetric reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of alkenes with CO  2  via nickel catalysis.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reductive carboxylation of organo (pseudo)halides with CO  2  is a powerful method to provide carboxylic acids quickly. Notably, the catalytic reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons via CO  2  fixation is a highly challenging but desirable approach for structurally diverse carboxylic acids. However, there are only a few reports but no examples of alkenes via transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Herein, we report the first asymmetric reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of alkenes with CO  2  via nickel catalysis. A variety of aryl (pseudo)halides, such as aryl bromides, aryl triflates and inert aryl chlorides of particular note, undergo the reaction smoothly to give important oxindole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid derivatives bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter.

         <title>Semiconductor Bowtie Nanoantenna from Coupled Colloidal Quantum Dot Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Top&#8208;down fabricated nanoantenna architectures of both metallic and dielectric materials demonstrated powerful functionalities for Raman and fluorescence enhancement with relevance to single molecule sensing, while inducing directionality of chromophore emission with implications for single photon sources. Herein, we synthesize the smallest bowtie nanoantenna by selective tip&#8208;to&#8208;tip fusion of two tetrahedral colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) forming a dimer. While the tetrahedral monomers emit non&#8208;polarized light, the bowtie architecture manifests nanoantenna functionality of enhanced emission polarization along the bowtie axis as predicted theoretically and revealed by single particle spectroscopy. Theory also predicts the formation of an electric&#8208;field hotspot at the bowtie epicenter. This is utilized for selective light induced photocatalytic metal growth at that location, unlike growth on the free tips in dark conditions thus demonstrating the bowtie dimer functionality as a photochemical reaction center. Our findings pave a path for additional bottom&#8208;up bowtie architectures applicable in optics, sensing and photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>The Boundary of Lithium Plating in Graphite Electrode for Safe Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphite has been the dominant anode material for practical lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, uncontrolled Li plating in graphite electrodes remains the main bottleneck that endangers battery life and safety, which have driven tremendous efforts aiming to eliminate Li plating. Herein we systematically investigate the boundary of Li plating in graphite electrodes for safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries. On one hand, the cell exhibits superior safety performance than that with Li dendrites by defining the endurable amount of uniform Li plating in graphite anode. On the other hand, the presence of &#8220;dead Li&#8221; can be eliminated owing to the uniform distribution of Li plating, and the average Coulombic efficiency for deposited Li during the reversible plating/stripping process is decoupled as high as ~99.5%. Attributing to the limited Li plating with superior Coulombic efficiency, the LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 | graphite cell achieves a high capacity retention of 80.2% over 500 cycles. This work sheds a different light on further improving the fast&#8208;charging capability, low&#8208;temperature performance, and energy density of practical lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Microscale Thermophoresis for Simultaneous Measurement of Binding Affinity and Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microscale thermophoresis (MST) is a versatile technique to measure binding affinities of binder&#8208;ligand systems, based on the directional movement of molecules in a temperature gradient. In this study, we extended MST to measure binding kinetics as well as binding affinity in a single experiment by increasing the thermal dissipation of the sample. The kinetic relaxation fingerprints were derived from the fluorescence changes during thermodynamic re&#8208;equilibration of the sample after local heating. Using this method, we measured DNA hybridization on&#8208;rates and off&#8208;rates in the range 10  4  &#8208;10  6&#160;  M  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  and 10  &#8208;4  &#8208;10  &#8208;1  s  &#8209;1  , respectively. We observed the expected exponential dependence of the DNA hybridization off&#8208;rates on salt concentration, strand length and inverse temperature. The measured on&#8208;rates showed a linear dependence on salt concentration and weak dependence on strand length and temperature. For biomolecular interactions with large enthalpic contributions, the kinetic MST technique offers a robust, cost&#8208;effective and immobilization&#8208;free determination of kinetic rates and binding affinity simultaneously, even in crowded solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ratiometric Fluorescent Lateral Flow Immunoassay for Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing of Acute Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Early and rapid diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is of exceptional significance in the control of cardiovascular diseases. Herein we report the development of a highly sensitive ratiometric fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay (RFLFIA) strip for rapid and accurate detection of AMI biomarker, namely heart&#8208;type fatty acid binding protein (H&#8208;FABP). The RFLFIA strip works in terms of ratiometric change of fluorescence signal, arising from blending of fluorescence emitted by two composite nanostructures conjugated to capture and probe antibodies and inner filter effect of gold nanoparticles. In conjunction with using custom smartphone&#8208;based analytical device and tonality analysis, quantitative detection of H&#8208;FABP was achieved with a low limit of detection at 0.21 ng mL  &#8722;1  . In addition, the RFLFIA strip can generate a visually distinguishable green&#8208;to&#8208;red color change around the threshold concentration of H&#8208;FABP (6.2 ng mL  &#8722;1  ), thus allowing the semi&#8208;quantitative diagnosis by the naked eye with a high accuracy and reproducibility. Thanks to unique advantages of the ratiometric fluorescence strategy, the RFLFIA strip shows analytical performance superior to conventional fluorescence strip and comparable to clinical latex agglutination test, thus holding the potentiality in point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing and at&#8208;home self&#8208;testing diagnosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Amino&#8208;Functionalised Hybrid Ultramicroporous Materials that Enable Single&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from a Ternary Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid ultramicroporous materials in which aminopyrazine ligands substitute pyrazine ligands are the first physisorbents that enable polymer&#8208;grade (&gt;99.95&#8201;%) ethylene production from ternary C2&#8208;CO2 gas mixtures under ambient conditions thanks to coadsorption of both C2H2 and CO2.







Abstract
Pyrazine&#8208;linked hybrid ultramicroporous (pore size &lt;7&#8197;&#197;) materials (HUMs) offer benchmark performance for trace carbon capture thanks to strong selectivity for CO2 over small gas molecules, including light hydrocarbons. That the prototypal pyrazine&#8208;linked HUMs are amenable to crystal engineering has enabled second generation HUMs to supersede the performance of the parent HUM, SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn, mainly through substitution of the metal and/or the inorganic pillar. Herein, we report that two isostructural aminopyrazine&#8208;linked HUMs, MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni (17=aminopyrazine; M=Si, Ti), which we had anticipated would offer even stronger affinity for CO2 than their pyrazine analogs, unexpectedly exhibit reduced CO2 affinity but enhanced C2H2 affinity. MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni are consequently the first physisorbents that enable single&#8208;step production of polymer&#8208;grade (&gt;99.95&#8201;% for SIFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni) ethylene from a ternary equimolar mixture of ethylene, acetylene and CO2 thanks to coadsorption of the latter two gases. We attribute this performance to the very different binding sites in MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni versus SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn.

         <title>Selectivity Map for the Late Stages of CO and CO2 Reduction to C2 Species on Copper Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selectivity map is provided for the late stages of CO2 reduction to C2 molecules based on computational models and electrochemical experiments. Sites with moderate coordination are efficient for ethylene production, with Cu(100) being more active than defective surfaces. Conversely, kinks and steps are more active for ethanol production.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO and CO2 reduction reactions (CORR and CO2RR) using copper catalysts and renewable electricity hold promise as a carbon&#8208;neutral route to produce commodity chemicals and fuels. However, the exact mechanisms and structure sensitivity of Cu electrodes toward C2 products are still under debate. Herein, we investigate ethylene oxide reduction (EOR) as a proxy to the late stages of CORR to ethylene, and the results are compared to those of acetaldehyde reduction to ethanol. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that ethylene oxide undergoes ring opening before exclusively reducing to ethylene via *OH formation. Based on generalized coordination numbers (CN), a selectivity map for the late stages of CORR and CO2RR shows that sites with moderate coordination (5.9 &lt; CN &lt; 7.5) are efficient for ethylene production, with pristine Cu(100) being more active than defective surfaces such as Cu(311). In contrast, kinks and edges are more active for ethanol production, while (111) terraces are relatively inert.

         <title>Decoding the Complex Free Radical Cascade by Using a DNA Framework&#8208;Based Artificial DNA Encoder</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA framework&#8208;based artificial DNA encoder for the complex free radical cascade was developed. Unlike time&#8208;consuming and vulnerable genome&#8208;encoded systems, it can actively sense and actuate information communications in real time, with enhanced environmental tolerance, broad decoding activities, and concurrent blocking of adverse communications between free radicals and inflammatory signaling, contributing to its anti&#8208;obesity effects.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;based molecular communications (DMC) are critical for regulating biological networks to maintain stable organismic functions. However, the complicated, time&#8208;consuming information transmission process involved in genome&#8208;coded DMC and the limited, vulnerable decoding activity generally lead to communication impairment or failure, in response to external stimuli. Herein, we present a conceptually innovative DMC strategy mediated by the DNA framework&#8208;based artificial DNA encoder. With the free&#8208;radical cascade as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, the artificial DNA encoder shows active sensing and real&#8208;time actuation, in&#8197;situ and broad free radical&#8208;decoding efficacy, as well as robust resistance to environmental noise. It can also block undesirable short&#8208;to&#8208;medium&#8208;range communications between free radicals and inflammatory networks, leading to a synergistic anti&#8208;obesity effect. The artificial DNA encoder&#8208;based DMC may be generalized to other communication systems for a variety of applications.

         <title>Frequency&#8208;Upconverted Stimulated Emission by Up to Six&#8208;Photon Excitation from Highly Extended Spiro&#8208;Fused Ladder&#8208;Type Oligo(p&#8208;phenylene)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient frequency&#8208;upconverted fluorescence and stimulated emission have been demonstrated in spiro&#8208;fused ladder&#8208;type oligo(p&#8208;phenylene)s through multiphoton absorption with an absorbed photon number up to six. The results demonstrate an effective molecular design strategy for exploring highly efficient MPA fluorophores for multiphoton optical applications.







Abstract
Frequency&#8208;upconverted fluorescence and stimulated emission induced by multiphoton absorption (MPA) have attracted much interest. As compared with low&#8208;order MPA processes, the construction of high&#8208;order MPA processes is highly desirable and rather attractive, yet remains a formidable challenge due to its inherent low transition probability. We report the observation of the first experimental frequency&#8208;upconverted fluorescence and stimulated emission by simultaneous six&#8208;photon excitation in an organic molecular system. The well&#8208;designed organic conjugated system based on cross&#8208;shaped spiro&#8208;fused ladder&#8208;type oligo(p&#8208;phenylene)s (SpL&#8722;z, z=1&#8211;3) manifests reasonably high MPA cross&#8208;sections and brilliant luminescence emission simultaneously. The six&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section of SpL&#8208;3 with an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation was evaluated as 8.67&#215;10&#8722;169&#8197;cm12&#8201;s5&#8201;photon&#8722;5. Exceptionally efficient 2&#8208; to 6&#8208;photon excited stimulated emission was achieved under near&#8208;infrared laser excitation.

         <title>Efficient Amino&#8208;Sulfhydryl Stapling on Peptides and Proteins Using Bifunctional NHS&#8208;Activated Acrylamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Michael acceptors and N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide activated esters stand among the most used reagents in the peptide functionalization toolbox. These two types of functional groups are merged in NHS&#8208;activated acrylamide reagents for efficient chemoselective amino&#8208;sulfhydryl stapling on native peptides and proteins. This is a versatile strategy for orthogonal dual&#8208;modification and late&#8208;stage design of functional bioconjugates.







Abstract
Widely used reagents in the peptide functionalization toolbox, Michael acceptors and N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) activated esters, are combined in NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides for efficient chemoselective amino&#8208;sulfhydryl stapling on native peptides and proteins. NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides allow for a fast functionalization of N&#8208;terminal cysteines (k2=1.54&#177;0.18&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) under dilute aqueous conditions, enabling selectivity over other nucleophilic amino acids. Additionally, the versatility of these new bioconjugation handles was demonstrated in the cross&#8208;linking of in&#8208;chain or C&#8208;terminal cysteines with nearby lysine residues. NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides are compatible with the use of other cysteine selective reagents, allowing for orthogonal dual&#8208;modifications. This strategy was successfully applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides and proteins with a PEG unit, fluorescent probe, and cytotoxic agent. The level of molecular control offered by NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides is expected to promote amino&#8208;sulfhydryl stapling technology as a powerful strategy to design functional bioconjugates.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Pot Template Reaction Towards a Manganese&#8208;Based T1 Contrast Agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a single&#8208;pot template synthesis strategy for a manganese&#8208;based MRI contrast agent, MnLMe. MnLMe is highly inert toward zinc&#8208;transmetallation and displays enhanced T1 relaxivity upon non&#8208;covalent interaction with serum albumin. In&#8197;vivo studies show higher contrast enhancement in the liver and longer blood half&#8208;life than that of the commercially available contrast agent Magnevist. MnLMe shows great potential for use as a blood pool agent.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based contrast agents (MnCAs) have emerged as suitable alternatives to gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents (GdCAs). However, due to their kinetic lability and laborious synthetic procedures, only a few MnCAs have found clinical MRI application. In this work, we have employed a highly innovative single&#8208;pot template synthetic strategy to develop a MnCA, MnLMe, and studied the most important physicochemical properties in&#8197;vitro. MnLMe displays optimized r1 relaxivities at both medium (20 and 64&#8197;MHz) and high magnetic fields (300 and 400&#8197;MHz) and an enhanced r1b=21.1&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 (20&#8197;MHz, 298&#8197;K, pH&#8197;7.4) upon binding to BSA (Ka=4.2&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1). In&#8197;vivo studies show that MnLMe is cleared intact into the bladder through renal excretion and has a prolonged blood half&#8208;life compared to the commercial GdCA Magnevist.

     alt="A Single&#8208;Pot Template Reaction Towards a Manganese&#8208;Based T1 Contrast Agent"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a single&#8208;pot template synthesis strategy for a manganese&#8208;based MRI contrast agent, &lt;b&gt;MnL&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;MnL&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; is highly inert toward zinc&#8208;transmetallation and displays enhanced &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; relaxivity upon non&#8208;covalent interaction with serum albumin. In&#8197;vivo studies show higher contrast enhancement in the liver and longer blood half&#8208;life than that of the commercially available contrast agent Magnevist. &lt;b&gt;MnL&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; shows great potential for use as a blood pool agent.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manganese&#8208;based contrast agents (MnCAs) have emerged as suitable alternatives to gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents (GdCAs). However, due to their kinetic lability and laborious synthetic procedures, only a few MnCAs have found clinical MRI application. In this work, we have employed a highly innovative single&#8208;pot template synthetic strategy to develop a MnCA, &lt;b&gt;MnL&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, and studied the most important physicochemical properties in&#8197;vitro. &lt;b&gt;MnL&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; displays optimized &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; relaxivities at both medium (20 and 64&#8197;MHz) and high magnetic fields (300 and 400&#8197;MHz) and an enhanced &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;=21.1&#8197;mM&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (20&#8197;MHz, 298&#8197;K, pH&#8197;7.4) upon binding to BSA (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=4.2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). In&#8197;vivo studies show that &lt;b&gt;MnL&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; is cleared intact into the bladder through renal excretion and has a prolonged blood half&#8208;life compared to the commercial GdCA Magnevist. &lt;b&gt;MnL&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; shows great promise as a novel MRI contrast agent.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Conductive Metallophthalocyanine Framework Films with High Carrier Mobility as Efficient Chemiresistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated and conductive 2D metallophthalocyanine framework with cobalt tetraaza[14]annulene linkages (see structure) exhibited high electrical conductivity of up to 0.52&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1 and a high carrier mobility of 0.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8201;s&#8722;1. Thin films of the material with thicknesses of 100&#8211;1000&#8197;nm functioned as efficient chemiresistors and displayed high sensitivity and selectivity towards gases at low concentrations.







Abstract
The poor electrical conductivity of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystalline frameworks greatly limits their utilization in optoelectronics and sensor technology. Herein, we describe a conductive metallophthalocyanine&#8208;based NiPc&#8208;CoTAA framework with cobalt(II) tetraaza[14]annulene linkages. The high conjugation across the whole network combined with densely stacked metallophthalocyanine units endows this material with high electrical conductivity, which can be greatly enhanced by doping with iodine. The NiPc&#8208;CoTAA framework was also fabricated as thin films with different thicknesses from 100 to 1000&#8197;nm by the steam&#8208;assisted conversion method. These films enabled the detection of low&#8208;concentration gases and exhibited remarkable sensitivity and stability. This study indicates the enormous potential of metallophthalocyanine&#8208;based conductive frameworks in advanced stand&#8208;off chemical sensors and provides a general strategy through tailor&#8208;make molecular design to develop sensitive and stable chemical sensors for the detection of low&#8208;concentration gases.

         <title>Hierarchical Metal&#8211;Polymer Hybrids for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metal&#8211;polymer hybrids constructed from various metals and different polymers showed outstanding performance for the electroreduction of CO2 with simultaneously enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability. The 3D hierarchical structure of the metals and in situ formation of the electrodes were found to be critical for high performance.







Abstract
The design of catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability is key to the electroreduction of CO2. Herein, we report the synthesis of 3D hierarchical metal/polymer&#8211;carbon paper (M/polymer&#8208;CP) electrodes by in situ electrosynthesis. The 3D polymer layer on CP (polymer&#8208;CP) was first prepared by in situ electropolymerization, then a 3D metal layer was decorated on the polymer&#8208;CP to produce the M/polymer&#8208;CP electrode. Electrodes with different metals (e.g. Cu, Pd, Zn, Sn) and various polymers could be prepared by this method. The electrodes could efficiently reduce CO2 to desired products, such as C2H4, CO, and HCOOH, depending on the metal used. For example, C2H4 could be formed with a Faradaic efficiency of 59.4&#8201;% and a current density of 30.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 by using a very stable Cu/PANI&#8208;CP electrode in an H&#8208;type cell. Control experiments and theoretical calculations showed that the 3D hierarchical structure of the metals and in situ formation of the electrodes are critical for the excellent performance.

         <title>Preparation of a Multicarbazole&#8208;Based Nanocapsule Capable of Largely Modulating Guest Spectroscopic Properties in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanocapsule composed of multiple carbazole panels was formed from bent carbazole&#8208;based amphiphiles in water. The capsule displayed enhanced emissivity, improved electrochemical stability, and unique host abilities toward substituted dyes. Notably, a highly blue&#8208;shifted absorption band from twisted coumarin dyes and two absorption bands from boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dimers stacked in an unusual L&#8208;shaped fashion were observed in the cavity.







Abstract
A nanocapsule composed of multiple carbazole panels (ca. 12 panels) was quantitatively generated from bent carbazole&#8208;based amphiphiles in water. Unlike previously reported macrocycles and coordination cages bearing several carbazole panels, the resultant nanocapsule displays enhanced emissivity and improved electrochemical stability as compared with the monomeric amphiphile. The spectroscopic properties of substituted coumarin and boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dyes can be modulated upon encapsulation by the nanocapsule in water. In the cavity, a highly blue&#8208;shifted absorption band is observed from largely twisted coumarin dyes and two absorption bands are found from boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dimers stacked in an unusual L&#8208;shaped fashion. Moreover, the encapsulated dimers exhibit unique excimer&#8208;like emission.

         <title>Tunable Hydrophobicity via Dimensionally Confined Polymerization of Organometallic Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By restricting polymerization in the native pores of pre&#8208;packed undercooled particles, organometallic adducts were autonomously generated on either flat&#8208; or pre&#8208;textured particle beds. These adducts&#8217; fine structures successfully turned the Wenzel wetting state of metal rose into the Cassie state of composite lotus.







Abstract
Fabrication of tunable fine textures on solid metal surfaces often demands sophisticated reaction/processing systems. By exploiting in&#8197;situ polymerization and self&#8208;assembly of inorganic adducts derived from liquid metals (the so&#8208;called HetMet reaction) with concomitant solidification, solid metal films with tunable texture are readily fabricated. Serving as a natural dimensional confinement, interparticle pores and capillary&#8208;adhered thin liquid films in a pre&#8208;packed bed of undercooled liquid metal particles lead to the expeditious surface accumulation of organometallic synthons, which readily oligomerize and self&#8208;assemble into concentration&#8208;dictated morphologies/patterns. Tuning particle size, particle packing (flat or textured), and reactant concentration generates diverse, autonomously organized organometallic structures on a metal particle bed. Concomitant solidification and sintering of the underlying undercooled particle bed led to a multiscale patterned solid metal surface. The process is illustrated by creating tunable features on pre&#8208;organized metal particle beds with concomitant tunable wettability as illustrated through the so&#8208;called petal and lotus effects.

         <title>Ag44(EBT)26(TPP)4 Nanoclusters With Tailored Molecular and Electronic Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9038-9044, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the synthesis and total structure determination of a novel Ag44(EBT)26(TPP)4 nanocluster, the first analogue of [Ag44(SR)30]4&#8722;, are reported. The identical size as well as similar core&#8208; and different surface&#8208;structures of these two nanoclusters enable the study of the structural effect on the optical and photophysical properties. The novel surface structure plays a crucial role in the enhancement of NIR&#8208;II photoluminescence.







Abstract
Although atomically precise metalloid nanoclusters (NCs) of identical size with distinctly different molecular structures are highly desirable to understand the structural effects on the optical and photophysical properties, their synthesis remains highly challenging. Herein, we employed phosphine and thiol capping ligands featuring appropriate steric effects and synthesized a charge&#8208;neutral Ag NC with the formula Ag44(EBT)26(TPP)4 (EBT: 2&#8208;ethylbenzenethiolate; TPP: triphenylphosphine). The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure reveals that this NC has a hollow metal core of Ag12@Ag20 and a metal&#8211;ligand shell of Ag12(EBT)26(TPP)4. The presence of mixed ligands and long V&#8208;shaped metal&#8211;ligand motifs on this NC has resulted in an enhancement of the NIR&#8208;II photoluminescence quantum yield by &gt;25&#8208;fold compared to an all&#8208;thiolate&#8208;stabilized anionic [Ag44(SR)30]4&#8722; NC (SR: thiolate). Time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional calculations show that our Ag44 NC is an 18&#8208;electron superatom with a modulated electronic structure as compared to the [Ag44(SR)30]4&#8722; anion, significantly influencing its optical properties.

         <title>A Solid&#8208;State Intramolecular Wittig Reaction Enables Efficient Synthesis of Endofullerenes Including Ne@C60, 3He@C60, and HD@C60</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8960-8966, April 12, 2021. </description>

Solid&#8208;state filling of a stable phosphorus ylid open&#8208;cage fullerene is followed by heating, inducing an in&#8197;situ intramolecular Wittig reaction to reduce the size of the cage opening and trapping a single gas atom or molecule inside. Expensive gases can be compressed to high pressure, leading to high incorporation of the endohedral species. Cage closure steps allow preparation of gram&#8208;scale endohedral fullerenes including 3He@C60, HD@C60, and Ne@C60.







Abstract
An open&#8208;cage fullerene incorporating phosphorous ylid and carbonyl group moieties on the rim of the orifice can be filled with gases (H2, He, Ne) in the solid state, and the cage opening then contracted in&#8197;situ by raising the temperature to complete an intramolecular Wittig reaction, trapping the atom or molecule inside. Known transformations complete conversion of the product fullerene to C60 containing the endohedral species. As well as providing an improved synthesis of large quantities of 4He@C60, H2@C60, and D2@C60, the method allows the efficient incorporation of expensive gases such as HD and 3He, to prepare HD@C60 and 3He@C60. The method also enables the first synthesis of Ne@C60 by molecular surgery, and its characterization by crystallography and 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Chiral Self&#8208;sorting of Giant Cubic [8+12] Salicylimine Cage Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8896-8904, April 12, 2021. </description>

Highly selective chiral self&#8208;sorting. The chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior of large cubic [8+12] salicylimine cage compounds was investigated, revealing a high selectivity for the most symmetric cage compounds, for which an explanation is presented. The properties of the isolated enantiopure and meso cage compounds were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and gas sorption measurements showing high porosities and selectivities.







Abstract
Chiral self&#8208;sorting is intricately connected to the complicated chiral processes observed in nature and no artificial systems of comparably complexity have been generated by chemists. However, only a few examples of purely organic molecules have been reported so far, where the self&#8208;sorting process could be controlled. Herein, we describe the chiral self&#8208;sorting of large cubic [8+12] salicylimine cage compounds based on a chiral TBTQ precursor. Out of 23 possible cage isomers only the enantiopure and a meso cage were observed to be formed, which have been unambiguously characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, by careful choice of solvent the formation of meso cage could be controlled. With internal diameters of din=3.3&#8211;3.5&#8197;nm these cages are among the largest organic cage compounds characterized and show very high specific surface areas up to approx. 1500&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 after desolvation.

         <title>Free&#8208;Radical Membrane Protein Footprinting by Photolysis of Perfluoroisopropyl Iodide Partitioned to Detergent Micelle by Sonication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8867-8873, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser&#8208;mediated free&#8208;radical footprinting of an integral membrane protein (IMP) is described. Compared to canonical footprinting, the approach exploits tip sonication to ensure efficient transport of a highly hydrophobic perfluoroalkyl iodide to footprint transmembrane domains. This approach, which is amenable to native IMP structures, yields 100&#8201;% coverage for tyrosine, and it is compatible with standard proteomic mass spectrometric analysis.







Abstract
A free&#8208;radical footprinting approach is described for integral membrane protein (IMP) that extends, significantly, the &#8220;fast photochemical oxidation of proteins&#8221; (FPOP) platform. This new approach exploits highly hydrophobic perfluoroisopropyl iodide (PFIPI) together with tip sonication to ensure efficient transport into the micelle interior, allowing laser dissociation and footprinting of the transmembrane domains. In contrast to water soluble footprinters, PFIPI footprints both the hydrophobic intramembrane and the hydrophilic extramembrane domains of the IMP vitamin&#8197;K epoxide reductase (VKOR). The footprinting is fast, giving high coverage for Tyr (100&#8201;%) and Trp. The incorporation of the reagent with sonication does not significantly affect VKOR's enzymatic function, and tyrosine iodination does not compromise protease digestion and the subsequent analysis. The locations for the modifications are largely consistent with the corresponding solvent accessibilities, recommending this approach for future membrane protein footprinting.

A mild, surface&#8208;specific method for the surface functionalization of few&#8208;layer black phosphorus nanosheets is developed using a family of photolytically generated nitrenes (RN) from the corresponding azides. By embedding spectroscopic tags in the organic backbone, a multitude of techniques can be used to investigate the chemical structure of the modified nanosheets.







Abstract
Surface functionalization of two&#8208;dimensional crystals is a key path to tuning their intrinsic physical and chemical properties. However, synthetic protocols and experimental strategies to directly probe chemical bonding in modified surfaces are scarce. Introduced herein is a mild, surface&#8208;specific protocol for the surface functionalization of few&#8208;layer black phosphorus nanosheets using a family of photolytically generated nitrenes (RN) from the corresponding azides. By embedding spectroscopic tags in the organic backbone, a multitude of characterization techniques are employed to investigate in detail the chemical structure of the modified nanosheets, including vibrational, X&#8208;ray photoelectron, solid state 31P&#8197;NMR, and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy. To directly probe the functional groups introduced on the surface, R fragments were selected such that in conjunction with vibrational spectroscopy, 15N&#8208;labeling experiments, and DFT methods, diagnostic P=N vibrational modes indicative of iminophosphorane units on the nanosheet surface could be conclusively identified.

         <title>Robust Biological Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Post&#8208;Functionalized Rhenium(I) Sites for Efficient Heterogeneous Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction</title>

A robust porous biological HOF with bpy docking groups has been designed, prepared, and post&#8208;modified to precisely load Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl as molecular catalyst on the basis of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking metal&#8208;free G&#8208;quadruplex moieties. With the help of the sensitizer, the post&#8208;functionalized HOF promotes efficient and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion in a heterogeneous system under the visible&#8208;light irradation.







Abstract
A robust 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;derived biological hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework (HOF&#8208;25) has been realized depending on guanine&#8208;quadruplex with the assistance of &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, which reacts with Re(CO)5Cl to give a post&#8208;functionalized HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopic study on HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re confirms the covalent attachment of Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl segments to this HOF. Robust and recycled HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re bearing photocatalytic Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl centers displays good heterogeneous catalytic activity towards carbon dioxide photoreduction in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 and triisopropanolamine in CH3CN under visible&#8208;light irradiation, with both high CO production rate of 1448&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and high selectivity of 93&#8201;%. Under the same conditions, the experimental turnover number of HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re (50) is about 8 times as that of the homogeneous control Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl. The sustainably regenerated HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re via crystallization and post&#8208;modification processes shows recovered photocatalytic performance.

         <title>&#8220;NAD&#8208;display&#8221;: Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput in Vitro Screening of NAD(H) Dehydrogenases Using Bead Display and Flow Cytometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9015-9021, April 12, 2021. </description>

A detection system was devised to screen dehydrogenase enzymes (DH) at ultrahigh&#8208;throughput in in vitro droplet compartments. An NAD(H) analogue and a DH DNA library were co&#8208;immobilised on beads. Water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion droplets containing cell&#8208;free expression mix and substrate allow compartmentalised protein production and catalysis. A fluorescent sensor of NAD(H) redox state was loaded onto beads, allowing bulk sorting of 2&#215;104 DH variants in a day by flow cytometry.







Abstract
NAD(H)&#8208;utiliing enzymes have been the subject of directed evolution campaigns to improve their function. To enable access to a larger swath of sequence space, we demonstrate the utility of a cell&#8208;free, ultrahigh&#8208;throughput directed evolution platform for dehydrogenases. Microbeads (1.5 million per sample) carrying both variant DNA and an immobilised analogue of NAD+ were compartmentalised in water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion droplets, together with cell&#8208;free expression mixture and enzyme substrate, resulting in the recording of the phenotype on each bead. The beads&#8217; phenotype could be read out and sorted for on a flow cytometer by using a highly sensitive fluorescent protein&#8208;based sensor of the NAD+:NADH ratio. Integration of this &#8220;NAD&#8208;display&#8221; approach with our previously described Split &amp; Mix (SpliMLiB) method for generating large site&#8208;saturation libraries allowed straightforward screening of fully balanced site saturation libraries of formate dehydrogenase, with diversities of 2&#215;104. Based on modular design principles of synthetic biology NAD&#8208;display offers access to sophisticated in vitro selections, avoiding complex technology platforms.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Cages with Missing Linker Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9099-9105, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahedral and hexahedral coordination cages with one or two missing linkers, as well as regular trigonal prismatic cages, are synthesized by employing steric hindrance of organic linkers to manipulate coordination modes of lanthanide(III) ions. The defective cages, especially the hexahedral cage, are conformationally flexible and adapt its structure to accommodate various guest molecules with sizes comparable or much larger than the cavity portals that are not accessible to the non&#8208;defective cage.







Abstract
We present here the controlled synthesis of defective coordination cages by employing steric hindrance of organic linkers to manipulate coordination modes of the assembled metal ions. Three chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) derived bis&#8208;tridentate ligands L1&#8211;L3 with pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamides (pcam) chelating moieties are therefore designed and synthesized, among which L3 has a smaller steric hindrance on the coordinating sites relative to the other two linkers. Complexes of L1 and L2 with lanthanides afford the irregular Ln8(L1)10 hexahedra with two missing edges and Ln4(L2)5 tetrahedra with one missing edge, respectively, both of which contain a 1:1 mixture of Ln(pcam)2 and Ln(pcam)3. In contrast, complex of L3 produces the regular twisted Ln6(L3)9 trigonal prisms without missing edges that contain only Ln(pcam)3 vertices. The defective cage has more freedom to adjust its structural conformation, affording adaptable cavity to accommodate a range of guest molecules with sizes comparable or much larger than the cavity portals.

         <title>High&#8208;Silica CHA Zeolite Membrane with Ultra&#8208;High Selectivity and Irradiation Stability for Krypton/Xenon Separation</title>

High&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes show ultra&#8208;high Kr/Xe selectivity and superior hydrothermal stability. Together with their irradiation stability, high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes can pave the way to enrich radioactive 85Kr from xenon for a notable decrease in the volatile nuclear waste volume.







Abstract
Capture and storage of the long&#8208;lived 85Kr is an efficient approach to mitigate the emission of volatile radionuclides from the spent nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities. However, it is challenging to separate krypton (Kr) from xenon (Xe) because of the chemical inertness and similar physical properties. Herein we prepared high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes with ultra&#8208;high selectivity and irradiation stability for Kr/Xe separation. The suitable aperture size and rigid framework endures the membrane a strong size&#8208;exclusion effect. The ultrahigh selectivity of 51&#8211;152 together with the Kr permeance of 0.7&#8211;1.3&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;Pa&#8722;1 of high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes far surpass the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymeric membranes. The membrane is among the most stable polycrystalline membranes for separation of humid Kr/Xe mixtures. Together with the excellent irradiation stability, high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes pave the way to separate radioactive Kr from Xe for a notable reduction of the volatile nuclear waste storage volume.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Actuated Remote Activation of Ferroptosis in Target Tumor Cells through a Photothermally Responsive Iron&#8208;Chelated Biopolymer Nanoplatform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8938-8947, April 12, 2021. </description>

Ferroptosis is a new form of regulated cell death and holds promise for tumor inhibition. However, it is difficult to remotely control the initiation and execution of ferroptosis in specific sites. This study reports a biocompatible and biodegradable biopolymeric nanoplatform for tumor&#8208;targeted ferroptosis therapy, of which the pro&#8208;ferroptotic activities could be activated in an on&#8208;demand manner using near&#8208;infrared light as the triggering signal.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a new form of regulated cell death that shows promise for tumor treatment. Most current ferroptosis tumor therapies are based on the intrinsic pathological features of the malignancies, and it would be of clinical significance to develop ferroptosis&#8208;inducing strategies with improved tumor specificity and modulability. Here we report a polydopamine&#8208;based nanoplatform (FeIIPDA@LAP&#8208;PEG&#8208;cRGD) for the efficient loading of Fe2+ and &#946;&#8208;lapachone (LAP), which could readily initiate ferroptosis in tumor cells upon treatment with near&#8208;infrared light. PDA nanostructures could generate mild hyperthermia under NIR irritation and trigger the release of the ferroptosis&#8208;inducing Fe2+ ions. The NIR&#8208;actuated photothermal effect would also activate cellular heat shock response and upregulate the downstream NQO1 via HSP70/NQO1 axis to facilitate bioreduction of the concurrently released &#946;&#8208;lapachone and enhance intracellular H2O2 formation to promote the Fe2+&#8208;mediated lipid peroxidation.

         <title>Activation of Pyroptosis by Membrane&#8208;Anchoring AIE Photosensitizer Design: New Prospect for Photodynamic Cancer Cell Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9093-9098, April 12, 2021. </description>

Membrane anchoring photosensitizers with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics were designed for cancer cell ablation via photo&#8208;activated pyroptosis.







Abstract
Pyroptosis as a lytic and inflammatory form of cell death is a powerful tool to fight against cancer. However, pyroptosis is usually activated by chemotherapeutic drugs, which limits its anti&#8208;tumor applications due to drug resistance and severe side effects. Herein, we demonstrate that membrane targeting photosensitizers can induce pyroptosis for cancer cell ablation with noninvasiveness and low side effects. A series of membrane anchoring photosensitizers (TBD&#8208;R PSs) with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics were prepared through conjugation of TBD and phenyl ring with cationic chains. Upon light irradiation, cytotoxic ROS were produced in situ, resulting in direct membrane damage and superior cancer cell ablation. Detailed study revealed that pyroptosis gradually became the dominant cell death pathway along with the increase of TBD&#8208;R PSs membrane anchoring capability. This study offers a photo&#8208;activated pyroptosis&#8208;based intervention strategy for cancer cell ablation.

A single iron atom catalyst composed of atomically&#8208;dispersed iron sites anchored on a N,O&#8208;doped carbon matrix with an inverse opal structure is developed to accelerate nitrogen reduction reaction kinetics for efficient conversion of N2 into NH3.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) plays a vital role for next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy conversion technologies. However, the NRR kinetics is still limited by the sluggish hydrogenation process on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst. Herein, we report the rational design and synthesis of a hybrid catalyst with atomic iron sites anchored on a N,O&#8208;doped porous carbon (FeSA&#8208;NO&#8208;C) matrix of an inverse opal structure, leading to a remarkably high NH3 yield rate of 31.9&#8197;&#956;g
&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and Faradaic efficiency of 11.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V for NRR electrocatalysis, outperformed almost all previously reported atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts. Theoretical calculations revealed that the observed high NRR catalytic activity for the FeSA&#8208;NO&#8208;C catalyst stemmed mainly from the optimized charge&#8208;transfer between the adjacent O and Fe atoms homogenously distributed on the porous carbon support, which could not only significantly facilitate the transportation of N2 and ions but also effectively decrease the binding energy between the isolated Fe atom and *N2 intermediate and the thermodynamic Gibbs free energy of the rate&#8208;determining step (*N2 &#8594; *NNH).

         <title>One Polyketide Synthase, Two Distinct Products: Trans&#8208;Acting Enzyme&#8208;Controlled Product Divergence in Calbistrin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8851-8858, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calbistrin biosynthesis involves an unusual dual&#8208;functional polyketide synthase CalA, which synthesizes both of the two structurally distinct moieties of calbistrins. The product divergence is intriguingly controlled by two trans&#8208;acting enzymes, a trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and a trans&#8208;acting C&#8208;methyltransferase CalH, to yield the decalin and polyene portions, respectively.







Abstract
Calbistrins are fungal polyketides consisting of the characteristic decalin and polyene moieties. Although the biosynthetic gene cluster of calbistrin&#8197;A was recently identified, the pathway of calbistrin&#8197;A biosynthesis has largely remained uninvestigated. Herein, we investigated the mechanism by which the backbone structures of calbistrins are formed, by heterologous and in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis and a structural biological study. Intriguingly, our analyses revealed that the decalin and polyene portions of calbistrins are synthesized by the single polyketide synthase (PKS) CalA, with the aid of the trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and the trans&#8208;acting C&#8208;methyltransferase CalH, respectively. We also determined that the esterification of the two polyketide parts is catalyzed by the acyltransferase CalD.

     alt="One Polyketide Synthase, Two Distinct Products: Trans&#8208;Acting Enzyme&#8208;Controlled Product Divergence in Calbistrin Biosynthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calbistrin biosynthesis involves an unusual dual&#8208;functional polyketide synthase CalA, which synthesizes both of the two structurally distinct moieties of calbistrins. The product divergence is intriguingly controlled by two &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acting enzymes, a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acting &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;methyltransferase CalH, to yield the decalin and polyene portions, respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calbistrins are fungal polyketides consisting of the characteristic decalin and polyene moieties. Although the biosynthetic gene cluster of calbistrin&#8197;A was recently identified, the pathway of calbistrin&#8197;A biosynthesis has largely remained uninvestigated. Herein, we investigated the mechanism by which the backbone structures of calbistrins are formed, by heterologous and in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis and a structural biological study. Intriguingly, our analyses revealed that the decalin and polyene portions of calbistrins are synthesized by the single polyketide synthase (PKS) CalA, with the aid of the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acting &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;methyltransferase CalH, respectively. We also determined that the esterification of the two polyketide parts is catalyzed by the acyltransferase CalD. Our study has uncovered a novel dual&#8208;functional PKS and thus broadened our understanding of how fungi synthesize diverse polyketide natural products.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fe/Fe3C Boosts H2O2 Utilization for Methane Conversion Overwhelming O2 Generation</title>

In a heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;type FeNx/C catalyst, Fe&#8208;Nx sites and graphene&#8208;encapsulated Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles promote the efficient generation of hydroxyl radicals from H2O2 for the highly selective oxidation of methane to formic acid. The reaction mechanism at the active sites has been studied.







Abstract
H2O2 as a well&#8208;known efficient oxidant is widely used in the chemical industry mainly because of its homolytic cleavage into .OH (stronger oxidant), but this reaction always competes with O2 generation resulting in H2O2 waste. Here, we fabricate heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;type Fe&#8208;based catalysts containing Fe&#8208;Nx sites and Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles as a model to study this competition. Fe&#8208;Nx in the low spin state provides the active site for .OH generation. Fe/Fe3C, in particular Fe3C, promotes Fe&#8208;Nx sites for the homolytic cleavages of H2O2 into .OH, but Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles (Fe0 as the main component) with more electrons are prone to the undesired O2 generation. With a catalyst benefiting from finely tuned active sites, 18&#8201;% conversion rate for the selective oxidation of methane was achieved with about 96&#8201;% selectivity for liquid oxygenates (formic acid selectivity over 90&#8201;%). Importantly, O2 generation was suppressed 68&#8201;%. This work provides guidance for the efficient utilization of H2O2 in the chemical industry.

         <title>Unveiling the Photoinduced Electron&#8208;Donating Character of MoS2 in Covalently Linked Hybrids Featuring Perylenediimide</title>

The well&#8208;known electron acceptor perylenediimide (PDI) is covalently attached to semiconducting MoS2, thus exposing the MoS2 material's electron donating potential in the novel MoS2&#8211;PDI hybrid.







Abstract
The covalent functionalization of MoS2 with a perylenediimide (PDI) is reported and the study is accompanied by detailed characterization of the newly prepared MoS2&#8208;PDI hybrid material. Covalently functionalized MoS2 interfacing organic photoactive species has shown electron and/or energy accepting, energy reflecting or bi&#8208;directional electron accepting features. Herein, a rationally designed PDI, unsubstituted at the perylene core to act as electron acceptor, forces MoS2 to fully demonstrate for the first time its electron donor capabilities. The photophysical response of MoS2&#8208;PDI is visualized in an energy&#8208;level diagram, while femtosecond transient absorption studies disclose the formation of MoS2.+&#8208;PDI.&#8722; charge separated state. The tunable electronic properties of MoS2, as a result of covalently linking photoactive organic species with precise characteristics, unlock their potentiality and enable their application in light&#8208;harvesting and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Two Cryptic Self&#8208;Resistance Mechanisms in Streptomyces tenebrarius Reveal Insights into the Biosynthesis of Apramycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8990-8996, April 12, 2021. </description>

Two cryptic self&#8208;resistance mechanisms involving C&#8208;5 phosphorylation and N&#8208;7&#8242; acetylation were discovered in Streptomyces tenebrarius to avoid auto&#8208;toxicity during apramycin biosynthesis. Characterization of the corresponding enzymes revealed the apramycin's assembly line at the pseudotrisaccharide stage.







Abstract
Apramycin is a clinically promising aminoglycoside antibiotic (AGA). To date, mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis and self&#8208;resistance of apramycin remain largely unknown. Here we report that apramycin biosynthesis proceeds through unexpected phosphorylation, deacetylation, and dephosphorylation steps, in which a novel aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (AprU), a putative creatinine amidohydrolase (AprP), and an alkaline phosphatase (AprZ) are involved. Biochemical characterization revealed that AprU specifically phosphorylates 5&#8208;OH of a pseudotrisaccharide intermediate, whose N&#8208;7&#8242; acetyl group is subsequently hydrolyzed by AprP. AprZ is located extracellularly where it removes the phosphate group from a pseudotetrasaccharide intermediate, leading to the maturation of apramycin. Intriguingly, 7&#8242;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylated and 5&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylated apramycin that were accumulated in &#916;aprU and &#916;aprZ respectively exhibited significantly reduced antibacterial activities, implying Streptomyces tenebrarius employs C&#8208;5 phosphorylation and N&#8208;7&#8242; acetylation as two strategies to avoid auto&#8208;toxicity. Significantly, this study provides insight into the design of new generation AGAs to circumvent the emergence of drug&#8208;resistant pathogens.

         <title>Unified Approach to Furan Natural Products via Phosphine&#8208;Palladium Catalysis</title>

Highly substituted polyalkyl furans can be synthesized using sequential Michael&#8211;Heck reactions between functionalized (Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;halo allylic alcohols and activated alkynes. This method provides facile access to tetraalkyl furans containing a C2&#8208;carboxyalkyl chain, which is readily functionalized to enable the total syntheses of several classes of bioactive furans, including furanoterpenes, polyketides, and furan fatty acids.







Abstract
Polyalkyl furans are widespread in nature, often performing important biological roles. Despite a plethora of methods for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted furans, the construction of tetraalkyl furans remains non&#8208;trivial. The prevalence of alkyl groups in bioactive furan natural products, combined with the desirable bioactivities of tetraalkyl furans, calls for a general synthetic protocol for polyalkyl furans. This paper describes a Michael&#8211;Heck approach, using sequential phosphine&#8208;palladium catalysis, for the preparation of various polyalkyl furans from readily available precursors. The versatility of this method is illustrated by the total syntheses of nine distinct polyalkylated furan natural products belonging to different classes, namely the furanoterpenes rosefuran, sesquirosefuran, and mikanifuran; the marine natural products plakorsins&#8197;A, B, and D and plakorsin&#8197;D methyl ester; and the furan fatty acids 3D5 and hydromumiamicin.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyalkyl furans are widespread in nature, often performing important biological roles. Despite a plethora of methods for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted furans, the construction of tetraalkyl furans remains non&#8208;trivial. The prevalence of alkyl groups in bioactive furan natural products, combined with the desirable bioactivities of tetraalkyl furans, calls for a general synthetic protocol for polyalkyl furans. This paper describes a Michael&#8211;Heck approach, using sequential phosphine&#8208;palladium catalysis, for the preparation of various polyalkyl furans from readily available precursors. The versatility of this method is illustrated by the total syntheses of nine distinct polyalkylated furan natural products belonging to different classes, namely the furanoterpenes rosefuran, sesquirosefuran, and mikanifuran; the marine natural products plakorsins&#8197;A, B, and D and plakorsin&#8197;D methyl ester; and the furan fatty acids 3D5 and hydromumiamicin.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Rapid High&#8208;Resolution 3D Printing and Surface Functionalization via Type I Photoinitiated RAFT Polymerization</title>

Rapid RAFT 3D Printing: Photoinduced RAFT polymerization is applied to 3D printing, resulting in rapid prints with a broad window of operation. High resolution surface patterning from the 3D printed objects is readily achieved by reactivation of dormant RAFT functionalities in the polymeric material.







Abstract
RAFT facilitated digital light projection 3D printing of polymeric materials provides a convenient and facile route for inducing post&#8208;fabrication transformations via reactivation of dormant chain transfer agents. In this work, we report the use of a Norrish type I photoinitiator in conjunction with a RAFT agent to produce a variety of open&#8208;air 3D printable resins that rapidly cure under visible light irradiation. The photoinitiator&#8208;RAFT system polymerizes extremely quickly and provides high 3D printing build rates of up to 9.1&#8197;cm&#8201;h&#8722;1, representing a 7&#8208;fold increase compared to previous RAFT mediated 3D printing systems. 3D printed materials containing thiocarbonylthio groups can be also produced using low concentrations of divinyl comonomers in the initial resins, which has not been successfully achieved using other photocontrolled RAFT polymerization techniques. Interestingly, the inclusion of RAFT agents significantly improves 3D printing resolution compared to formulations without RAFT agent, allowing the fabrication of intricate and complex objects. Spatiotemporally controlled surface modifications of the 3D printed objects from the dormant RAFT agent groups on the material surfaces were also performed under one and two&#8208;pass configurations, inducing multiple successive post&#8208;printing transformations on the same object.

         <title>Stabilization of Polynitrogen Anions in Tantalum&#8211;Nitrogen Compounds at High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9003-9008, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct reaction between nitrogen and tantalum at approximately 100&#8197;GPa results in the energetic nitrogen&#8208;rich compounds TaN4 and TaN5, which feature N4 chains and unprecedented branched single&#8208;bonded polymeric nitrogen chains in the crystal structures, respectively. TaN5 possesses an extraordinary volumetric energy density of 18&#8197;kJ&#8201;cm&#8722;3, exceeding well&#8208;known high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials.







Abstract
The synthesis of polynitrogen compounds is of great importance due to their potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials (HEDM), but because of the intrinsic instability of these compounds, their synthesis and stabilization is a fundamental challenge. Polymeric nitrogen units which may be stabilized in compounds with metals at high pressure are now restricted to non&#8208;branched chains with an average N&#8722;N bond order of 1.25, limiting their HEDM performances. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of a novel polynitrogen compound TaN5 via a direct reaction between tantalum and nitrogen in a diamond anvil cell at circa 100&#8197;GPa. TaN5 is the first example of a material containing branched all&#8208;single&#8208;bonded nitrogen chains [N55&#8722;]&#8734;. Apart from that we discover two novel Ta&#8211;N compounds: TaN4 with finite N44&#8722; chains and the incommensurately modulated compound TaN2&#8722;x, which is recoverable at ambient conditions.

         <title>Selectively Upgrading Lignin Derivatives to Carboxylates through Electrochemical Oxidative C(OH)&#8722;C Bond Cleavage by a Mn&#8208;Doped Cobalt Oxyhydroxide Catalyst</title>

An electrochemical strategy has been developed for the oxidative cleavage of C(OH)&#8722;C bonds using a manganese&#8208;doped cobalt oxyhydroxide catalyst under mild conditions. Preliminary studies demonstrate its application in upgrading lignin&#8208;derived products with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C motifs, electrorefining them into valuable oxygenates, such as benzoate and adipate.







Abstract
Oxidative cleavage of C(OH)&#8722;C bonds to afford carboxylates is of significant importance for the petrochemical industry and biomass valorization. Here we report an efficient electrochemical strategy for the selective upgrading of lignin derivatives to carboxylates by a manganese&#8208;doped cobalt oxyhydroxide (MnCoOOH) catalyst. A wide range of lignin&#8208;derived substrates with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C units undergo efficient cleavage to corresponding carboxylates in excellent yields (80&#8211;99&#8201;%) and operational stability (200&#8197;h). Detailed investigations reveal a tandem oxidation mechanism that base from the electrolyte converts secondary alcohols and their derived ketones to reactive nucleophiles, which are oxidized by electrophilic oxygen species on MnCoOOH from water. As proof of concept, this approach was applied to upgrade lignin derivatives with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C motifs, achieving convergent transformation of lignin&#8208;derived mixtures to benzoate and KA oil to adipate with 91.5&#8201;% and 64.2&#8201;% yields, respectively.

         <title>Enhanced Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production by Self&#8208;Photosensitized Biohybrid Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9055-9062, April 12, 2021. </description>

Novel biohybrid systems are created for light&#8208;driven H2 production by using non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms self&#8208;photosensitized with CdS nanoparticles. An outstanding biohybrid system using D. desulfuricans displays high H2 production activity, high stability and a remarkable solar efficiency.







Abstract
Storage of solar energy as hydrogen provides a platform towards decarbonizing our economy. One emerging strategy for the production of solar fuels is to use photocatalytic biohybrid systems that combine the high catalytic activity of non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms with the high light&#8208;harvesting efficiency of metal semiconductor nanoparticles. However, few such systems have been tested for H2 production. We investigated light&#8208;driven H2 production by three novel organisms, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Citrobacter freundii, and Shewanella oneidensis, self&#8208;photosensitized with cadmium sulfide nanoparticles, and compared their performance to Escherichia coli. All biohybrid systems produced H2 from light, with D. desulfuricans&#8208;CdS demonstrating the best activity overall and outperforming the other microbial systems even in the absence of a mediator. With this system, H2 was continuously produced for more than 10&#8197;days with a specific rate of 36&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gdcw&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. High apparent quantum yields of 23&#8201;% and 4&#8201;% were obtained, with and without methyl viologen, respectively, exceeding values previously reported.

         <title>Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity at Room Temperature in Cu4TiSe4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9106-9113, April 12, 2021. </description>

Cu4TiSe4 is a unique example of a non&#8208;toxic and low&#8208;cost material that exhibits a lattice ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity of 0.19&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at room temperature. The main contribution to the unusually low thermal conductivity is connected with the atomic lattice and its dynamics.







Abstract
Ultralow thermal conductivity draws great attention in a variety of fields of applications such as thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. Herein, the crystal structure and transport properties of Cu4TiSe4 are reported. Cu4TiSe4 is a unique example of a non&#8208;toxic and low&#8208;cost material that exhibits a lattice ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity of 0.19&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at room temperature. The main contribution to the unusually low thermal conductivity is connected with the atomic lattice and its dynamics. This ultralow value of lattice thermal conductivity (kL) can be attributed to the presence of the localized modes of Cu, which partially hybridize with the Se atoms, which in turn leads to avoidance of crossing of acoustic phonon modes that reach the zone boundary with a reduced frequency. Like a phonon glass electron crystal, Cu4TiSe4 could also open a route to efficient thermoelectric materials, even, with chalcogenides of relatively high electrical resistivity and a large band gap, provided that their structures offer a sublattice with lightly bound cations.

         <title>Platinum Dissolution in Realistic Fuel Cell Catalyst Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8882-8888, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8197;situ technique is presented that closes the gap between catalyst degradation studies in real devices and fundamental electrochemical analyses. The method involves direct measurement of platinum dissolution in realistic catalyst layers and through Nafion membranes. The impact of catalyst loading and electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface on platinum dissolution, as well as transport behavior of dissolved Pt species through Nafion membranes, are investigated.







Abstract
Pt dissolution has already been intensively studied in aqueous model systems and many mechanistic insights have been gained. Nevertheless, transfer of new knowledge to real&#8208;world fuel cell systems is still a significant challenge. To close this gap, we present a novel in&#8197;situ method combining a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) half&#8208;cell with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS). With this setup, Pt dissolution in realistic catalyst layers and the transport of dissolved Pt species through Nafion membranes were evaluated directly. We observed that 1)&#8197;specific Pt dissolution increased significantly with decreasing Pt loading, 2)&#8197;in comparison to experiments on aqueous model systems with flow cells, the measured dissolution in GDE experiments was considerably lower, and 3)&#8197;by adding a membrane onto the catalyst layer, Pt dissolution was reduced even further. All these phenomena are attributed to the varying mass transport conditions of dissolved Pt species, influencing re&#8208;deposition and equilibrium potential.

         <title>Cys&#8211;Cys and Cys&#8211;Lys Stapling of Unprotected Peptides Enabled by Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9022-9031, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional hypervalent iodine reagents for two&#8208;component cysteine&#8208;cysteine and cysteine&#8208;lysine stapling are reported. Efficient and selective stapling on non&#8208;protected peptides was observed, and post&#8208;stapling modification could be easily achieved using reactive esters or cycloaddition on the thioalkynes formed on the cysteine residue. One stapled peptide displayed both enhanced helicity and binding to the MDM2 protein.







Abstract
Easy access to a wide range of structurally diverse stapled peptides is crucial for the development of inhibitors of protein&#8208;protein interactions. Herein, we report bis&#8208;functional hypervalent iodine reagents for two&#8208;component cysteine&#8208;cysteine and cysteine&#8208;lysine stapling yielding structurally diverse thioalkyne linkers. This stapling method works with unprotected natural amino acid residues and does not require pre&#8208;functionalization or metal catalysis. The products are stable to purification and isolation. Post&#8208;stapling modification can be accessed via amidation of an activated ester, or via cycloaddition onto the formed thioalkyne group. Increased helicity and binding affinity to MDM2 was obtained for a i,i+7 stapled peptide.

         <title>B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn Gas Diffusion Electrodes for CO2 Electroreduction to C2+&#8197;Products at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9135-9141, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A B&#8208;Cu gas diffusion electrode (GDE) system was developed for highly selective CO2 conversion to C2+&#8197;products at high relevant current densities by mitigating the flooding problem and tuning the three&#8208;phase boundary. Anodic protection by sacrificial Zn&#8197;nanosheets remarkably improved the long&#8208;term stability for CO2 electroreduction at high current densities.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products has attracted considerable attention as it provides an avenue to high&#8208;density renewable energy storage. However, the selectivity and stability under high current densities are rarely reported. Herein, B&#8208;doped Cu (B&#8208;Cu) and B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) were developed for highly selective and stable CO2 conversion to C2+&#8197;products at industrially relevant current densities. The B&#8208;Cu GDE exhibited a high Faradaic efficiency of 79&#8201;% for C2+&#8197;products formation at a current density of &#8722;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a potential of &#8722;0.45&#8197;V vs. RHE. The long&#8208;term stability for C2+ formation was substantially improved by incorporating an optimal amount of Zn. Operando Raman spectra confirm the retained Cu+ species under CO2 reduction conditions and the lower overpotential for *OCO formation upon incorporation of Zn, which lead to the excellent conversion of CO2 to C2+ products on B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn GDEs.

         <title>Organelle&#8208;Specific Photoactivation of DNA Nanosensors for Precise Profiling of Subcellular Enzymatic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8923-8931, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating organelle&#8208;specific targeting and NIR&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoactivation with DNA sensor technology, precise imaging of a specific enzyme in a chosen organelle (e.g., mitochondria or nucleus) was possible (see picture). The spatiotemporal control enabled imaging of enzyme translocation at subcellular resolution in response to oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Understanding of the functions of enzymes in diverse cellular processes is important, but the design of sensors with controllable localization for in situ imaging of subcellular levels of enzymatic activity is particularly challenging. We introduce herein a spatiotemporally controlled sensor technology that permits in situ localization and photoactivated imaging of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease&#8197;1 (APE1) within an intracellular organelle of choice (e.g., mitochondria or nucleus). The hybrid sensor platform is constructed by photoactivatable engineering of a DNA&#8208;based fluorescent probe and further combination with an upconversion nanoparticle and a specific organelle localization signal. Controlled localization and NIR&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoactivation of the sensor &#8220;on demand&#8221; effectively constrains the imaging signal to the organelle of interest, with improved subcellular resolution. We further demonstrate the application of the nanosensors for the imaging of subcellular APE1 translocation in response to oxidative stress in live cells.

&lt;p&gt;By integrating organelle&#8208;specific targeting and NIR&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoactivation with DNA sensor technology, precise imaging of a specific enzyme in a chosen organelle (e.g., mitochondria or nucleus) was possible (see picture). The spatiotemporal control enabled imaging of enzyme translocation at subcellular resolution in response to oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo.

         <title>(Aza)Acenes Share the C2 Bridge with (Anti)Aromatic Macrocycles: Local vs. Global Delocalization Paths</title>

Global switch for local effect: The linear fusion of (aza)acene and a redox switchable macrocycle (i.e. triphyrin(2.1.1)) gives a set of fused systems merging two &#960;&#8208;conjugated clouds. A competition between local and global effects can be distinguished as documented in spectroscopic properties with a domination of (aza)acene diatropic current obtained after a redox switching within the macrocyclic flank.







Abstract
A strong conjugation present in fused systems plays a crucial role in tuning of the properties that would be showing a dependence on the efficiency of &#960;&#8208;electrons coupling. The &#960;&#8208;cloud available in the final structure can be drastically influenced by a side&#8208; or a linear fusion of unsaturated and conjugated hydrocarbons. The linear welding of naphthalene/anthracene or quinoxaline/benzo[g]quinoxaline with triphyrin(2.1.1) gives structures where the competition between local and global delocalization is distinguished. The aromatic character observed in skeletons strongly depends on the oxidation state of the macrocyclic flanking and is either extended over the whole system or kept as a composition of local currents (diatropic and paratropic) of incorporated units. The hybrid systems show the properties derived from the &#960;&#8208;conjugations that interlace one another but also show a significant independence of (aza)acene subunits reflected in the observed spectroscopic properties.

         <title>Macrocyclic Arenes&#8208;Based Conjugated Macrocycle Polymers for Highly Selective CO2 Capture and Iodine Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8967-8975, April 12, 2021. </description>

Four catcher&#8208;type conjugated macrocycle polymers (CMP&#8208;n, n=1&#8211;4) have been designed and synthesized successfully, exhibiting interesting application in CO2 and I2 uptake. The CMP&#8208;2 is able to capture CO2 with excellent selectivity and the CMP&#8208;4 is capable of adsorbing iodine with outstanding capacity.







Abstract
Incorporating synthetic macrocycles with unique structures and distinct conformations into conjugated macrocycle polymers (CMPs) can endow the resulting materials with great potentials in gas uptake and pollutant adsorption. Here, four CMPs (CMP&#8208;n, n=1&#8211;4) capable of reversibly capturing iodine and efficiently separating carbon dioxide are constructed from per&#8208;triflate functionalized leaning tower[6]arene (LT6&#8208;OTf) and [2]biphenyl&#8208;extended pillar[6]arene (BpP6&#8208;OTf) via Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira&#8211;Hagihara cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Intriguingly, owing to the appropriate cavity size of LT6&#8208;OTf and the numerous aromatic rings in the framework, the newly designed CMP&#8208;4 possesses an outstanding I2 affinity with a large uptake capacity of 208&#8197;wt&#8201;% in vapor and a great removal efficiency of 94&#8201;% in aqueous solutions. To our surprise, with no capacity to accommodate nitrogen, CMP&#8208;2 constructed from BpP6&#8208;OTf is able to specifically capture carbon dioxide at ambient conditions.

The first catalytic enantioselective desymmetrizing Fischer indolization of prochiral diketones, containing enantiotopic carbonyl groups, is developed and shown to proceed through dynamic kinetic resolution. Catalyzed by a combination of a spirocyclic chiral phosphoric acid and ZnCl2, this reaction delivers cyclopenta[b]indolones, containing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter, with up to 98.5:1.5 e.r.







Abstract
The first catalytic enantioselective Fischer indolization of prochiral diketones containing enantiotopic carbonyl groups is developed and shown to proceed through dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). Catalyzed by the combination of a spirocyclic chiral phosphoric acid and ZnCl2 (Lewis acid assisted Br&#248;nsted acid), this direct approach combines 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones with N&#8208;protected phenylhydrazines to furnish cyclopenta[b]indole derivatives containing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter with good to excellent enantioselectivities.

         <title>An Unexpected Cubic Symmetry in Group&#8197;IV Alloys Prepared Using Pressure and Temperature</title>

New materials can be created without the need to follow conventional criteria and routes to synthesis. We demonstrate this for Ge&#8211;Sn, a system actively investigated for optoelectronic applications to overcome conventional cubic Si's deficiencies. Ge and Sn are however unreactive in the bulk, but we remove reactivity barriers and form a different structure, a simple new cubic solid solution.







Abstract
The cubic diamond (Fd
m) group IVA element Si has been the material driver of the electronics industry since its inception. We report synthesis of a new cubic (Im
m) group IVA material, a GeSn solid solution, upon heating Ge and Sn at pressures from 13 to 28&#8197;GPa using double&#8208;sided diamond anvil laser&#8208;heating and large volume press methods. Both methods were coupled with in situ angle dispersive X&#8208;ray diffraction characterization. The new material substantially enriches the seminal group IVA alloy materials landscape by introducing an eightfold coordinated cubic symmetry, which markedly expands on the conventional tetrahedrally coordinated cubic one. This cubic solid solution is formed, despite Ge never adopting the Im
m symmetry, melting inhibiting subsequent Im
m formation and reactant Ge and Sn having unlike crystal structures and atomic radii at all these pressures. This is hence achieved without adherence to conventional formation criteria and routes to synthesis. This advance creates fertile avenues for new materials development.

         <title>Dynamic Stereoselection of Peptide Helicates and Their Selective Labeling of DNA Replication Foci in Cells**

Artificial bipyridine&#8208;containing peptide ligands encode in their sequence the stereoselective folding into chiral three&#8208;stranded FeII or CoII peptide helicates and as kinetically inert dinuclear CoIII complexes by in&#8208;situ oxidation. These peptide helicates selectively label DNA replication foci in functional cells.







Abstract
Although largely overlooked in peptide engineering, coordination chemistry offers a new set of interactions that opens unexplored design opportunities for developing complex molecular structures. In this context, we report new artificial peptide ligands that fold into chiral helicates in the presence of labile metal ions such as FeII and CoII. Heterochiral &#946;&#8208;turn&#8208;promoting sequences encode the stereoselective folding of the peptide ligands and define the physicochemical properties of their corresponding metal complexes. Circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy in combination with computational methods allowed us to identify and determine the structure of two isochiral &#923;&#923;&#8208;helicates, folded as topological isomers. Finally, in addition to the in&#8208;vitro characterization of their selective binding to DNA three&#8208;way junctions, cell&#8208;microscopy experiments demonstrated that a rhodamine&#8208;labeled FeII helicate was internalized and selectively stains DNA replication factories in functional cells.

         <title>Constructing Electron Levers in Perovskite Nanocrystals to Regulate the Local Electron Density for Intensive Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8905-8912, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intra&#8208;crystalline electron lever strategy is proposed by constructing Mn&#8208;doped BiFeO3 nanocrystals with a Mn4+&#8722;O&#8722;Fe3+ bond lever, which can specifically increase the local electron density of the Fe reaction centre to improve the kinetics of chemodynamic therapy. This method is promising in future research on the quantitative regulation of electron density and on&#8208;demand chemical reactivity adjustment.







Abstract
The local electron density of an atom is one key factor that determines its chemical properties. Regulating electron density can promote the atom's reactivity and so reduce the reaction activation energy, which is highly desired in many chemical applications. Herein, we report an intra&#8208;crystalline electron lever strategy, which can regulate the electron density of reaction centre atoms via manipulating ambient lattice states, for Fenton activity improvement. Typically, with the assistance of ultrasound, the Mn4+&#8722;O&#8722;Fe3+ bond in BiFe0.97Mn0.03O3 perovskite nanocrystals can drive valence electrons and free electrons to accumulate on Fe atoms by a polarization electric field originated from the designed lattice strain. The increase of electron density significantly improves the catalytic activity of Fe, decreasing the activation energy of BiFe0.97Mn0.03O3&#8208;mediated Fenton reaction by 52.55&#8201;%, and increasing the .OH yield by 9.21&#8208;fold. This study provides a new way to understand the sono&#8208;Fenton chemistry, and the increased .OH production enables a highly effective chemodynamic therapy.

         <title>A Superstrong and Reversible Ionic Crystal&#8208;Based Adhesive Inspired by Ice Adhesion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8948-8959, April 12, 2021. </description>

Inspired by reversible ice adhesion, a reversible ionic crystal (IC) based gel adhesive was prepared, which showed superstrong and reversible adhesion due to the phase transition of ICs. In addition, the reversible adhesion can be adjusted by heating and light, and be effectively monitored by resistance and capacitance.







Abstract
In this study, we developed a superstrong and reversible adhesive, which can possess a high bonding strength in the &#8220;adhesive&#8221; state and detach with the application of heating. An ionic crystal (IC) gel, in which an IC was immobilized within a soft&#8208;polymer matrix, were synthesized via in situ photo&#8208;crosslinking of a precursor solution composed of N, N&#8208;dimethyl acrylamide (DMAA) and a melted IC. The obtained IC gel is homogenous and transparent at melt point. When cooled to the phase transition temperature of the IC, the gel turns into the adhesive with the adhesion strength of 5.82&#8197;MPa (on glasses), due to the excellent wetting of melted gel and a thin layer of crystalline IC with high cohesive strength formed on the substrates. The synergistic effects between IC, polymer networks and substrates were investigated by solid state 1H&#8197;NMR and molecular dynamics simulation. Such an adhesive layer is reversable and can be detached by heating and subsequent re&#8208;adhesion via cooling. This study proposed the new design of removable adhesives, which can be used in dynamic and complex environments.

         <title>Quantifying the Likelihood of Structural Models through a Dynamically Enhanced Powder X&#8208;Ray Diffraction Protocol</title>

Structurally characterizing new and poorly crystalline materials such as covalent organic frameworks is highly challenging. The dynamic protocol of this work overcomes this challenge through a systematic likelihood ordering based on intuitive heuristics and X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. It succeeds in unambiguously identifying a material's atomic&#8208;level structure, accounting for the operando conditions and inherent temporal character of experiments.







Abstract
Structurally characterizing new materials is tremendously challenging, especially when single crystal structures are hardly available which is often the case for covalent organic frameworks. Yet, knowledge of the atomic structure is key to establish structure&#8208;function relations and enable functional material design. Herein, a new protocol is proposed to unambiguously predict the structure of poorly crystalline materials through a likelihood ordering based on the X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. Key of the procedure is the broad set of structures generated from a limited number of building blocks and topologies, which is submitted to operando structural characterization. The dynamic averaging in the latter accounts for the operando conditions and inherent temporal character of experimental measurements, yielding unparalleled agreement with experimental powder XRD patterns. The proposed concept can hence unquestionably identify the structure of experimentally synthesized materials, a crucial step to design next generation functional materials.

         <title>Asymmetric Hydroacylation Involving Alkene Isomerization for the Construction of C3&#8208;Chirogenic Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8997-9002, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective intramolecular hydroacylation of 3&#8208;enals involving alkene isomerization was developed for the efficient construction of C3&#8208;chirogenic cyclopentanones with satisfactory yields, diastereoselectivities, and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
A new transformation pattern for enantioselective intramolecular hydroacylation has been developed involving an alkene isomerization strategy. Proceeding through a five&#8208;membered rhodacycle intermediate, 3&#8208;enals were converted to C3&#8208; or C3,C5&#8208;chirogenic cyclopentanones with satisfactory yields, diastereoselectivities, and enantioselectivities. A catalytic cycle has been theoretically calculated and the origin of the stereoselection is rationally explained.

         <title>Mass Spectrometry Imaging of Bio&#8208;oligomer Polydispersity in Plant Tissues by Laser Desorption Ionization from Silicon Nanopost Arrays</title>

Simultaneous chemical analysis and spatial mapping of homopolymers used for energy storage and molecular feedstock in biological tissues are challenging using conventional MS imaging. Here, the spatial and size distributions for oligomers from polyhydroxybutyrate, polysaccharide, and polyglutamic acid are profiled in rhizobia&#8208;infected soybean root nodules by MS imaging using nanophotonic ionization from silicon nanopost arrays and MALDI.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables simultaneous spatial mapping for diverse molecules in biological tissues. Matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) has been a mainstream MSI method for a wide range of biomolecules. However, MALDI&#8208;MSI of biological homopolymers used for energy storage and molecular feedstock is limited by, e.g., preferential ionization for certain molecular classes. Matrix&#8208;free nanophotonic ionization from silicon nanopost arrays (NAPAs) is an emerging laser desorption ionization (LDI) platform with ultra&#8208;trace sensitivity and molecular imaging capabilities. Here, we show complementary analysis and MSI of polyhydroxybutyric acid (PHB), polyglutamic acid (PGA), and polysaccharide oligomers in soybean root nodule sections by NAPA&#8208;LDI and MALDI. For PHB, number and weight average molar mass, polydispersity, and oligomer size distributions across the tissue section and in regions of interest were characterized by NAPA&#8208;LDI&#8208;MSI.

         <title>Bio&#8208;adhesive Nanoporous Module: Toward Autonomous Gating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8932-8937, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous covalent organic framework (GlueCOF) carrying guanidinium ion pendants has been developed that can accommodate guests and bind to biopolymers. The strong bio&#8208;adhesive nature of GlueCOF was used to noncovalently bind to calmodulin (CaM), which acted as a gating component for the guest&#8208;loaded 1D nanopores (CaMCOF&#8835;guest). The conformational change of the CaM gate upon selective binding with Ca2+ enabled the release of guest molecules.







Abstract
Here we report a bio&#8208;adhesive porous organic module (GlueCOF) composed of hexagonally packed 1D nanopores based on a covalent organic framework. The nanopores are densely decorated with guanidinium ion (Gu+) pendants capable of forming salt bridges with oxyanionic species. GlueCOF strongly adheres to biopolymers through multivalent salt&#8208;bridging interactions with their ubiquitous oxyanionic species. By taking advantage of its strong bio&#8208;adhesive nature, we succeeded in creating a gate that possibly opens the nanopores through a selective interaction with a reporter chemical and releases guest molecules. We chose calmodulin (CaM) as a gating component that can stably entrap a loaded guest, sulforhodamine&#8197;B (SRB), within the nanopores (CaMCOF&#8835;SRB). CaM is known to change its conformation on binding with Ca2+ ions. We confirmed that mixing CaMCOF&#8835;SRB with Ca2+ resulted in the release of SRB from the nanopores, whereas the use of weakly binding Mg2+ ions resulted in a much slower release of SRB.

         <title>Cascaded Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer Towards Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Lasers Beyond 850&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9114-9119, April 12, 2021. </description>

Six&#8208;level energy systems are constructed through the cascaded occurrence of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer consisting of a first ultrafast proton transfer of &lt;430&#8197;fs and a following dominant and irreversible proton transfer of ca. 1.6&#8197;ps, which support the NIR single&#8208;mode lasing at 854&#8197;nm for exploiting energy&#8208;level systems of OSSLs, especially at the NIR region from 780 to 2500&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic solid&#8208;state lasers play an essential role in applications ranging from laser communication to infrared night vision, but progress in this area is restricted by the lack of effective excited&#8208;state gain processes. Herein, we originally proposed and demonstrated the cascaded occurrence of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer for constructing the completely new energy&#8208;level systems. Cascading by the first ultrafast proton transfer of &lt;430&#8197;fs and the subsequent irreversible second proton transfer of ca. 1.6&#8197;ps, the stepwise proton transfer process favors the true six&#8208;level photophysical cycle, which supports efficient population inversion and thus NIR single&#8208;mode lasing at 854&#8197;nm. This work realizes longest wavelength beyond 850&#8197;nm of organic single&#8208;crystal lasing to date and originally exploits the cascaded excited&#8208;state molecular proton transfer energy&#8208;level systems for organic solid&#8208;state lasers.

         <title>Efficient and Selective Interplay Revealed: CO2 Reduction to CO over ZrO2 by Light with Further Reduction to Methane over Ni0 by Heat Converted from Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9045-9054, April 12, 2021. </description>

CO2 photoreduction with Ni&#8208;ZrO2 as a catalyst under UV/Vis light was monitored by 13C&#8208;labeled mass chromatography, FTIR spectroscopy, and EXAFS. The interplay of bicarbonate reduction to CO over ZrO2 owing to charge separation by light with subsequent hydrogenation of CO over Ni heated from light enabled CO2 reduction to methane.







Abstract
The reaction mechanism of CO2 photoreduction into methane was elucidated by time&#8208;course monitoring of the mass chromatogram, in situ FTIR spectroscopy, and in situ extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Under 13CO2, H2, and UV/Vis light, 13CH4 was formed at a rate of 0.98&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 using Ni (10&#8197;wt&#8201;%)&#8208;ZrO2 that was effective at 96&#8197;kPa. Under UV/Vis light irradiation, the 13CO2 exchange reaction and FTIR identified physisorbed/chemisorbed bicarbonate and the reduction because of charge separation in/on ZrO2, followed by the transfer of formate and CO onto the Ni surface. EXAFS confirmed exclusive presence of Ni0 sites. Then, FTIR spectroscopy detected methyl species on Ni0, which was reversibly heated to 394&#8197;K owing to the heat converted from light. With D2O and H2, the H/D ratio in the formed methane agreed with reactant H/D ratio. This study paves the way for using first row transition metals for solar fuel generation using only UV/Vis light.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: One Polyketide Synthase, Two Distinct Products: Trans&#8208;Acting Enzyme&#8208;Controlled Product Divergence in Calbistrin Biosynthesis (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 16/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9143-9143, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calbistrin biosynthesis involves an unusual dual&#8208;functional polyketide synthase CalA, which synthesizes both of the two structurally distinct moieties of calbistrins. The product divergence is intriguingly controlled by two trans&#8208;acting enzymes, a trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and a trans&#8208;acting C&#8208;methyltransferanse CalH, to yield the decalin and polyene portions, respectively. The esterification of the two polyketide parts is catalyzed by the acyltransferase CalD, as reported by Yudai Matsuda, Ikuro Abe, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;8851.

Fe&#8208;Nx in the low&#8208;spin state is the active site in the homolytic cleavage of H2O2 to .OH, as reported by Wenting Wu, Mingbo Wu, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;8889. Fe/Fe3C promotes the formation of Fe&#8208;Nx sites for this homolytic cleavage process, enabling the highly selective oxidation of CH4 to HCOOH under light irradiation.

Circadian rhythms are present in most if not all animals, plants, and even photosynthetic cyanobacteria. These cyanobacterial clocks as well as plant clocks are very different from those of animals, with no credible homology between the different clock proteins. Therefore circadian rhythms probably emerged multiple times in evolution, which underscores their importance.

         <title>Multicolor Fluorescent Polymeric Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8608-8624, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor fluorescent polymeric hydrogels (MFPHs), rising stars of luminescent materials, are the marriage of multicolor fluorescent materials and polymeric hydrogels. They have many extraordinary properties, such as a tissue&#8208;like modulus, an intrinsic soft and wet nature, and fluorescence color change. In this Review, recent progress in MFPHs is summarized, with a particular focus on the construction methods and important applications.







Abstract
Multicolor fluorescent polymeric hydrogels (MFPHs) are three&#8208;dimensionally crosslinked hydrophilic polymer networks with tunable emission color. Different from the classic fluorescent materials that are used primarily in dry solid states or solutions, MFPHs exist as highly water&#8208;swollen quasi&#8208;solids. They thus present many promising properties of both solids and solution, including tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties, an intrinsic soft and wet nature, fabulous biocompatibility, along with a responsive volume, shape, and fluorescence color change. These advantageous properties hold great potential in many applications such as sensing, bioimaging, information encoding, encryption, biomimetic actuators, and soft robotics. This Review gives an in&#8208;depth overview of recent progress in the field of MFPHs, with a particular focus on the diverse construction methods and important demonstrated applications. Current challenges and future perspectives on MFPHs are also discussed.

         <title>Acid&#8211;Base Free Main Group Carbonyl Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8626-8648, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, hitherto elusive acid&#8208; and base&#8208;free main group carbonyl analogues (R2E=O) derived from group&#8197;13 to 15 elements have been isolated in crystalline form. Their unperturbed nature elicits exciting new chemistry, spanning the vista from classical organic carbonyl&#8208;type reactions to transition metal&#8208;like oxide ion transfer chemistry.







Abstract
Main group carbonyl analogues (R2E=O) derived from p&#8208;block elements (E=groups&#8197;13 to 15) have long been considered as elusive species. Previously, employment of chemical tricks such as acid&#8208; and base&#8208;stabilization protocols granted access to these transient species in their masked forms. However, electronic and steric effects inevitably perturb their chemical reactivity and distinguish them from classical carbonyl compounds. A new era was marked by the recent isolation of acid&#8211;base free main group carbonyl analogues, ranging from a lighter boracarbonyl to the heavier silacarbonyls, phosphacarbonyls and a germacarbonyl. Most importantly, their unperturbed nature elicits exciting new chemistry, spanning the vista from classical organic carbonyl&#8208;type reactions to transition metal&#8208;like oxide ion transfer chemistry. In this Review, we survey the strategies used for the isolation of such systems and document their emerging reactivity profiles, with a view to providing fundamental comparisons both with carbon and transition metal oxo species. This highlights the emerging opportunities for exciting &#8220;crossover&#8221; reactivity offered by these derivatives of the p&#8208;block elements.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8585-8595, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest developments in the large&#8208;scale production of carbon quantum dots by using microwave, ultrasonic, plasma, magnetic hyperthermia, and microfluidic techniques are outlined. The synthetic methods for generating carbon dot/polymer composites are summarized, whereby the carbon quantum dots can serve as fillers, monomers, or initiators. Promising applications, current challenges, and future perspectives are also highlighted and discussed.







Abstract
Carbon quantum dots (CDs) have inspired vast interest because of their excellent photoluminescence (PL) performances and their promising applications in optoelectronic, biomedical, and sensing fields. The development of effective approaches for the large&#8208;scale production of CDs may greatly promote the further advancement of their practical applications. In this Minireview, the newly emerging methods for the large&#8208;scale production of CDs are summarized, such as microwave, ultrasonic, plasma, magnetic hyperthermia, and microfluidic techniques. The use of the available strategies for constructing CD/polymer composites with intriguing solid&#8208;state PL is then described. Particularly, the multiple roles of CDs are emphasized, including as fillers, monomers, and initiators. Moreover, typical applications of CD/polymer composites in light&#8208;emitting diodes, fluorescent printing, and biomedicine are outlined. Finally, we discuss current problems and speculate on their future development.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 Genome Editing Machinery Using Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Vehicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8596-8606, April 12, 2021. </description>

Spatiotemporal delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing machinery is of great importance for developing chemical biology tools for manipulating cellular DNA sequences to treat genetic disorders. This Minireview provides an overview of synthetic approaches and specific chemistries that have been used to develop stimuli&#8208;responsive vehicles for CRISPR/Cas9 delivery and genome editing in a controlled manner.







Abstract
Recent innovations in genome editing have enabled the precise manipulation of the genetic information of mammalians, and benefitted the development of next&#8208;generation gene therapy. Despite these advances, several barriers to the clinical translation of genome editing remain, including the intracellular delivery of genome editing machinery, and the risk of off&#8208;target editing effect. Here, we review the recent advance of spatiotemporal delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing machinery, which is composed of programmable Cas9 nuclease and a single&#8208;guide RNA (sgRNA) using stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticles. We discuss the specific chemistries that have been used for controlled Cas9/sgRNA delivery and intracellular release in the presence of endogenous or external signals. These methodologies can leverage biological signals found locally within disease cells, or exogenous signals administrated with spatiotemporal control, through which an improved genome editing could be achieved. We also discuss the future in exploiting these approaches for fundamental biomedical applications and therapeutic genome editing.

         <title>Tautomeric Molecule Acts as a &#8220;Sunscreen&#8221; for Metal Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Harmful UV light and surface defects accelerate the degradation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A tautomeric &#8220;sunscreen&#8221; molecule can be used to protect the PSC from UV degradation and enable molecular defect passivation (defect formation energy: &#8722;1.35&#8197;eV) through interactions between functional groups and defects. This strategy provides high&#8208;efficiency PSCs with long&#8208;term UV stability.







Abstract
UV light always does great harm to perovskite solar cells, relentlessly degrading perovskites and shortening the lifetime of perovskite devices. Meanwhile, surface defects in perovskite films further accelerate the degradation process and serve as nonradiative charge recombination centers to deteriorate device efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate that a &#8220;sunscreen&#8221; molecule, 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;methoxybenzophenone, not only protects the perovskite solar cell from UV degradation but also enables molecular defect passivation through interaction between functional groups and defects by molecular tautomerism under UV light illumination. Therefore, the sunscreen strategy efficiently enhances the UV endurance of PSCs and improves defect formation energy to &#8722;1.35&#8197;eV. The perovskite solar cell with sunscreen (sunscreen PSC) exhibits outstanding efficiencies of up to 23.09&#8201;% (0.04&#8197;cm2) and 19.73&#8201;% (1.00&#8197;cm2) as well as long&#8208;term UV (UVa: 365&#8197;nm and UVb: 285&#8197;nm) stability.

         <title>Ambient&#8208;Stable Two&#8208;Dimensional Titanium Carbide (MXene) Enabled by Iodine Etching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8689-8693, April 12, 2021. </description>

An iodine&#8208;assisted method has been developed for etching bulk Ti3AlC2 in anhydrous acetonitrile (CH3CN), resulting in 2D MXene sheets (Ti3C2Tx, T=O, OH) with intact lattice, high yield (71&#8201;%), large size (1.8&#8197;&#956;m) and ultimate thickness (&lt;5&#8197;nm). 2D MXene sheets present great ambient stability in water for at least 2&#8197;weeks and high gravimetric capacitances of 293&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1 when serving as electrode materials for supercapacitors.







Abstract
MXene (e.g., Ti3C2) represents an important class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials owing to its unique metallic conductivity and tunable surface chemistry. However, the mainstream synthetic methods rely on the chemical etching of MAX powders (e.g., Ti3AlC2) using hazardous HF or alike, leading to MXene sheets with fluorine termination and poor ambient stability in colloidal dispersions. Here, we demonstrate a fluoride&#8208;free, iodine (I2) assisted etching route for preparing 2D MXene (Ti3C2Tx, T=O, OH) with oxygen&#8208;rich terminal groups and intact lattice structure. More than 71&#8201;% of sheets are thinner than 5&#8197;nm with an average size of 1.8&#8197;&#956;m. They present excellent thin&#8208;film conductivity of 1250&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and great ambient stability in water for at least 2 weeks. 2D MXene sheets with abundant oxygen surface groups are excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors, delivering a high gravimetric capacitance of 293&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a scan rate of 1&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1, superior to those made from fluoride&#8208;based etchants (&lt;290&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1). Our strategy provides a promising pathway for the facile and sustainable production of highly stable MXene materials.

         <title>Efficient Infrared&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction Over Ultrathin Metallic Ni&#8208;doped CoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8705-8709, April 12, 2021. </description>

It is a tough task to achieve IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Herein, an element&#8208;doped ultrathin metallic photocatalyst is designed to achieve IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Among the reported single&#8208;component photocatalysts, the most efficient IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction is realized by Ni&#8208;doped CoS2 nanosheets.







Abstract
Converting CO2 and H2O into carbon&#8208;based fuel by IR light is a tough task. Herein, compared with other single&#8208;component photocatalysts, the most efficient IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction is achieved by an element&#8208;doped ultrathin metallic photocatalyst&#8208;Ni&#8208;doped CoS2 nanosheets (Ni&#8208;CoS2). The evolution rate of CH4 over Ni&#8208;CoS2 is up to 101.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The metallic and ultrathin nature endow Ni&#8208;CoS2 with excellent IR light absorption ability. The PL spectra and Arrhenius plots indicate that Ni atoms could facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers and the decrease of the activation energy. Moreover, in situ FTIR, DFT calculations, and CH4&#8208;TPD reveal that the doped Ni atoms in CoS2 could effectively depress the formation energy of the *COOH, *CHO and desorption energy of CH4. This work manifests that element doping in atomic level is a powerful way to control the reaction intermediates, providing possibilities to realize high&#8208;efficiency IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Discovery of a Potent and Selective Cell&#8208;Active Inhibitor of SETDB1 Tudor Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8760-8765, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first potent and selective small&#8208;molecule SETDB1 tandem tudor domain (TTD) inhibitor, (R,R)&#8208;59, is reported. (R,R)&#8208;59 is an endogenous binder&#8208;competitive inhibitor and also showed activities in intact cells. The enantiomer (S,S)&#8208;59 did not show any activity.







Abstract
SET domain bifurcated protein 1 (SETDB1) is a histone lysine methyltransferase that promotes the silencing of some tumour suppressor genes and is overexpressed in many cancers. SETDB1 contains a unique tandem tudor domain (TTD) that recognizes histone H3 sequences containing both methylated and acetylated lysines. Beginning with the identification of a hit compound (Cpd1), we discovered the first potent and selective small molecule SETDB1&#8208;TTD inhibitor (R,R)&#8208;59 through stepwise structure&#8208;guided optimization. (R,R)&#8208;59 showed a KD value of 0.088&#177;0.045&#8197;&#956;M in the ITC assay. The high potency of (R,R)&#8208;59 was well explained by the cocrystal structure of the (R,R)&#8208;59&#8208;TTD complex. (R,R)&#8208;59 is an endogenous binder competitive inhibitor. Evidence has also demonstrated its cellular target engagement. Interestingly, the enantiomer (S,S)&#8208;59 did not show activity in all the assays, highlighting the potential of (R,R)&#8208;59 as a tool compound in exploring the biological functions of SETDB1&#8208;TTD.

   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;)&#8208;59&lt;/b&gt; showed a K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; value of 0.088&#177;0.045&#8197;&#956;M in the ITC assay. The high potency of &lt;b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;)&#8208;59&lt;/b&gt; was well explained by the cocrystal structure of the &lt;b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;)&#8208;59&lt;/b&gt;&#8208;TTD complex. &lt;b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;)&#8208;59&lt;/b&gt; is an endogenous binder competitive inhibitor. Evidence has also demonstrated its cellular target engagement. Interestingly, the enantiomer &lt;b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;)&#8208;59&lt;/b&gt; did not show activity in all the assays, highlighting the potential of &lt;b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;)&#8208;59&lt;/b&gt; as a tool compound in exploring the biological functions of SETDB1&#8208;TTD.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Formation of Nanoscale [Ge4O16Al48(OH)108(H2O)24]20+ from Condensation of &#1013;&#8208;GeAl128+ Keggin Polycations**

         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;condensation of &#1013;&#8208;GeAl128+ upon thermal aging is proposed as the mechanism for the formation of tetrameric [Ge4O16Al48(OH)108(H2O)24]20+ (Ge4Al4820+).







Abstract
Keggin&#8208;type polyaluminum cations belong to a unique class of compounds with their large positive charge, hydroxo bridges, and divergent isomerization/oligomerization. Previous reports indicated that oligomerization of this species can only occur through one isomer (&#948;), but herein we report the isolation of largest Keggin&#8208;type cluster that occurs through self&#8208;condensation of four &#1013;&#8208;isomers &#1013;&#8208;GeAl128+ to form [Ge4O16Al48(OH)108(H2O)24]20+ cluster (Ge4Al48). The cluster was crystallized and structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and the elemental composition was confirmed by ICP&#8208;MS and SEM&#8208;EDS. Additional dynamic light scattering experiments confirms the presence of the Ge4Al48 in thermally aged solutions. DFT calculations reveal that a single atom Ge substitution in tetrahedral site of &#1013;&#8208;isomer is the key for the formation of Ge4Al48 because it activates deprotonation at key surface sites that control the self&#8208;condensation process.

Enabled by a Pd/Cu cooperative catalyst system, the first example of defluorinative carbonylative coupling has been established. With gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and aryl iodides as the substrates, this methodology offers flexible and facile access to privileged &#945;&#8208;fluorochalcones under mild reaction conditions in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields.







Abstract
An unprecedented and challenging defluorinative carbonylation was achieved. Enabled by a Pd/Cu cooperative catalyst system, the first example of defluorinative carbonylative coupling has been established. With gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and aryl iodides as the substrates, this methodology offers flexible and facile access to privileged &#945;&#8208;fluorochalcones under mild reaction conditions in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Mechanistic studies indicated transmetalation between palladium and copper intermediates as a crucial step of the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Boosting Production of HCOOH from CO2 Electroreduction via Bi/CeOx</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8798-8802, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The limited current density, production rate as well as selectivity hinder the improvement of HCOOH production from CO2 electroreduction. Here, bismuth/cerium oxide (Bi/CeOx) displays outstanding performances for CO2 electroreduction to HCOOH, which not only shows excellent selectivity, but also achieves a high current density (149&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and especially the maximum HCOOH production rate (2600&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) ever reported.







Abstract
Formic acid (HCOOH) is one of the most promising chemical fuels that can be produced through CO2 electroreduction. However, most of the catalysts for CO2 electroreduction to HCOOH in aqueous solution often suffer from low current density and limited production rate. Herein, we provide a bismuth/cerium oxide (Bi/CeOx) catalyst, which exhibits not only high current density (149&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), but also unprecedented production rate (2600&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with high Faradaic efficiency (FE, 92&#8201;%) for HCOOH generation in aqueous media. Furthermore, Bi/CeOx also shows favorable stability over 34&#8197;h. We hope this work could offer an attractive and promising strategy to develop efficient catalysts for CO2 electroreduction with superior activity and desirable stability.

Nitrosobenzene can simultaneously activate the C&#8722;H bonds of aldehydes and the C&#8722;B bonds of boronic acids triggering a C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming process that leads to the synthesis of ketones via an intramolecular migration from boron to carbon. These findings constitute a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free practical, scalable, and operationally easy method for the synthesis of ketones.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of ketones from aldehydes and boronic acids via a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H functionalization reaction is reported. The method employs nitrosobenzene as a reagent to drive the simultaneous activation of the boronic acid as a boronate and the activation of the C&#8722;H bond of the aldehyde as an iminium species that triggers the key C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming step via an intramolecular migration from boron to carbon. These findings constitute a practical, scalable, and operationally straightforward method for the synthesis of ketones.

These findings constitute a practical, scalable, and operationally straightforward method for the synthesis of ketones.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Structural Revision of Natural Cyclic Depsipeptide MA026 Established by Total Synthesis and Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8792-8797, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A revised structure of natural cyclic depsipeptide MA026 with tight junction opening activity was established by physicochemical analysis and confirmed by its total solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Bioinformatic analysis of the putative MA026 biosynthetic gene cluster demonstrated that the stereochemistry of amino acid residue in the revised structure can be reasonably explained.







Abstract
A revised structure of natural 14&#8208;mer cyclic depsipeptide MA026, isolated from Pseudomonas sp. RtlB026 in 2002 was established by physicochemical analysis with HPLC, MS/MS, and NMR and confirmed by total solid&#8208;phase synthesis. The revised structure differs from that previously reported in that two amino acid residues, assigned in error, have been replaced. Synthesized MA026 with the revised structure showed a tight junction (TJ) opening activity like that of the natural one in a cell&#8208;based TJ opening assay. Bioinformatic analysis of the putative MA026 biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of RtIB026 demonstrated that the stereochemistry of each amino acid residue in the revised structure can be reasonably explained. Phylogenetic analysis with xantholysin BGC indicates an exceptionally high homology (ca. 90&#8201;%) between xantholysin and MA026. The TJ opening activity of MA026 when binding to claudin&#8208;1 is a key to new avenues for transdermal administration of large hydrophilic biologics.

         <title>The Atypical Hysteresis of [Fe(C6F5Tp)2]: Overlay of Spin&#8208;Crossovers and Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8803-8807, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [FeII(C6F5Tp)2] complex is converted through melting from a crystal phase showing a very gradual spin&#8208;crossover to another one showing a broad hysteretic spin&#8208;transition. The uncommon &#8220;rounded&#8221; hysteresis occurs in a non&#8208;cooperative SCO system. It is due to a symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition that is triggered when roughly ca. 50&#8201;% of the SCO complexes are switched.







Abstract
The [FeII(C6F5Tp)2] spin&#8208;crossover complex is an atypical molecular switch, which can be converted upon annealing between two archetypal spin&#8208;crossover behaviours: from an extremely gradual spin&#8208;crossover to a broad hysteretic spin&#8208;transition (of ca. 65&#8197;K). The hysteresis shows an uncommon &#8220;rounded shape&#8221; that is reproducible upon cycling temperature. In depth structural studies reveal a first crystal phase transition, which occurs upon melting and recrystallizing at high temperature. This first irreversible transition is associated with a radical change in the crystal packing. More importantly, the &#8220;rounded and broad&#8221; hysteretic transition is shown to occur in a non&#8208;cooperative SCO system and is associated with the occurrence of a symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition that appears when roughly ca. 50&#8201;% of the SCO complexes are switched.

         <title>GlycoBODIPYs: Sugars Serving as a Natural Stock for Water&#8208;soluble Fluorescent Probes of Complex Chiral Morphology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8766-8771, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twelve sugars, differing in size and stereochemistry, were used as building blocks in a modular, efficient four&#8208;step synthetic route to multifunctional BODIPY glycoconjugates with high fluorescence and hydrophilicity. The chiral information was transferred unchanged, thereby providing complex and distinct probes for target&#8208;oriented binding studies and specific in&#8197;vivo imaging.







Abstract
A range of unprocessed, reducing sugar substrates (mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trisaccharides) is shown to take part in a straightforward four&#8208;step synthetic route to water&#8208;soluble, uncharged BODIPY derivatives with unimpaired chiral integrity and high fluorescence efficiency. A wide compatibility with several postfunctionalizations is demonstrated, thus suggesting a universal utility of the multifunctional glycoconjugates, which we call GlycoBODIPYs. Knoevenagel condensations are able to promote a red&#8208;shift in the spectra, thereby furnishing strongly fluorescent red and far&#8208;red glycoconjugates of high hydrophilicity. The synthetic outcome was studied by X&#8208;ray crystallography and by comprehensive photophysical investigations in several solvent systems. Furthermore, cell experiments illustrate efficient cell uptake and demonstrate differential cell targeting as a function of the integrated chiral information.

With the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles (NPs), a load&#8208;bearing network of NPs forms as the areal density of NPs increases, converting a liquid&#8208;like assembly into a solid&#8208;like assembly. Real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging has been used to probe the evolution of the interfacial dynamics of nanoparticle surfactants at the water/oil interface by using aggregation&#8208;induced emission as a reporter for the transition of the assemblies into the jammed state (see graph).







Abstract
With the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles (NPs), a load&#8208;bearing network of NPs forms as the areal density of NPs increases, converting the assembly from a liquid&#8208;like into a solid&#8208;like assembly. Unlike vitrification, the lineal packing of the NPs in the network is denser, while the remaining NPs can remain in a liquid&#8208;like state. It is a challenge to determine the point at which the assemblies jam, since both jamming and vitrification lead to a solid&#8208;like behavior of the assemblies. Herein, we show a real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging method to probe the evolution of the interfacial dynamics of NP surfactants at the water/oil interface using aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) as a reporter for the transition of the assemblies into the jammed state. The AIEgens show typical fluorescence behavior at densities at which they can move and rotate. However, when aggregation of these fluorophores occurs, the smaller intermolecular separation distance arrests rotation, and a significant enhancement in the fluorescence intensity occurs.

A direct catalytic asymmetric addition of acetonitrile to aldehydes with high enantioselectivity is achieved by the strategic use of a sterically demanding NiII pincer carbene complex. This afforded highly enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;hydroxynitriles.







Abstract
A direct catalytic asymmetric addition of acetonitrile to aldehydes that realizes over 90&#8201;% ee is the ultimate challenge in alkylnitrile addition chemistry. Herein, we report achieving high enantioselectivity by the strategic use of a sterically demanding NiII pincer carbene complex, which afforded highly enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;hydroxynitriles. This highly atom&#8208;economical process paves the way for exploiting inexpensive acetonitrile as a promising C2 building block in a practical synthetic toolbox for asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Traceless Removal of Two Kernel Atoms in a Gold Nanocluster and Its Impact on Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8668-8672, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel nanoclusters Au48(m&#8208;MB)26 and Au46(m&#8208;MBT)26 have been synthesized and fully characterized, and the traceless removal of two kernel atoms in metal nanoclusters has been achieved for the first time. The two kernel atoms reduction leads to the photoluminescence quantum yield (QY) increase by almost four times. In addition, kernel bond length dependent photoluminescence and kernel charge state were first revealed.







Abstract
Removing or adding kernel atoms of metal nanoclusters (NCs) without leaving a trace is a substantial challenge because the kernel atoms are inside and covered by the outer staples. However, such kernel tuning is very important for improving the properties and acquiring an in&#8208;depth understanding of the kernel&#8208;property correlation. Photoluminescence (PL) is one of the most intriguing characteristics of metal NCs but has not been well understood until now. Inspired by these challenges/questions, we conducted this study and, for the first time, achieved the traceless removal of two kernel atoms in a gold nanocluster by applying a simple thermal treatment and revealed its impact on PL. Further, we demonstrated that the kernel Au&#8208;Au bond length can be an indicator for a comparison of the PL or kernel charge state between nanoclusters with similar kernel structures and sizes.

         <title>Dynamic Nuclear Polarization Enhanced Nuclear Spin Optical Rotation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8823-8826, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nuclear spin optical rotation (NSOR) signals are enhanced by hyperpolarization of nuclear spins using dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization. The signal enhancement leads to the measurement of the NSOR constant of dimethyl sulfoxide. A spectroscopy based on hyperpolarized NSOR offers the possibility to provide information on ground and excited electronic states in molecules, localized to an NMR&#8208;addressable site.







Abstract
Nuclear spin optical rotation (NSOR) has been investigated as a magneto&#8208;optical effect, which holds the potential for applications, including hybrid optical&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and gradientless imaging. The intrinsic nature of NSOR renders its detection relatively insensitive, which has prevented it moving from a proof of concept to a method supporting chemical characterizations. In this work, the dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization technique is introduced to provide nuclear spin polarization, increasing the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio by several thousand times. NSOR signals of 1H and 19F nuclei are observed in a single scan for diluted compounds, which has made this effect suitable for the determination of electronic transitions from a specific nucleus in a large molecule.

A method for catalytic kinetic resolution (KR) of acyclic &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides was developed via enantioselective acylation of primary alcohol with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. Enhanced selectivity was realized for the catalytic KR process using cyclic tertiary amine as a base additive. Diastereomeric transition state models are proposed to rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Enantioenriched acyclic &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides are valuable compounds in chemical, material and medicinal sciences, but their enantioselective synthesis remains challenging. A catalytic kinetic resolution (KR) of such amides with selectivity factor(s) up to &gt;200 is developed via enantioselective acylation of primary alcohol with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. An enhanced selectivity for the catalytic KR process is realized using cyclic tertiary amine as base additive. Diastereomeric transition state models for the process are proposed to rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Unprecedented Reactivity of &#947;&#8208;Amino Cyclopentenone Enables Diversity&#8208;Oriented Access to Functionalized Indoles and Indole&#8208;Annulated Ring Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8808-8812, April 12, 2021. </description>

This work highlights diversity&#8208;oriented access to cyclopentenoid indoles and indole&#8208;alkaloid like structures which is pillared on an unprecedented latent reactivity of &#947;&#8208;aminoenones. The transformation highlights &#947;&#8208; or &#946;,&#947;&#8208;functionalization of enones to generate new structural space. A reverse&#8208;aza&#8208;Piancatelli rearrangement seemed to be operating, which should invoke new attributes to its mechanism.







Abstract
Observation of an unexpected, Lewis acid promoted displacement of latent reactive &#947;&#8208;amino group on cyclopentenone presented unparalleled opportunity for enone functionalization and annulations with indole derivatives, which is developed in the current study. Herein, a vast range of C3/N&#8208;indolyl enones and indole alkaloid&#8208;like compound were accessed in excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and selectivity through a one&#8208;pot operation. The mechanism most likely involves an unprecedented trait of Piancatelli&#8208;type rearrangement where influence of the gem&#8208;diaryl group appeared crucial.

A reverse&#8208;aza&#8208;Piancatelli rearrangement seemed to be operating, which should invoke new attributes to its mechanism.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observation of an unexpected, Lewis acid promoted displacement of latent reactive &#947;&#8208;amino group on cyclopentenone presented unparalleled opportunity for enone functionalization and annulations with indole derivatives, which is developed in the current study. Herein, a vast range of C3/&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;indolyl enones and indole alkaloid&#8208;like compound were accessed in excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and selectivity through a &lt;i&gt;one&#8208;pot&lt;/i&gt; operation. The mechanism most likely involves an unprecedented trait of Piancatelli&#8208;type rearrangement where influence of the &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;diaryl group appeared crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enantioselective Reductive Cyanation and Phosphonylation of Secondary Amides by Iridium and Chiral Thiourea Sequential Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8827-8831, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective reductive cyanation and phosphonylation of secondary amides have been achieved by the combination of iridium with chiral thiourea catalysis. The protocol is highly efficient and enantioselective, providing a novel route for the synthesis of optically active &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates from bench&#8208;stable feedstocks.







Abstract
The combination of transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis increasingly offers chemists opportunities to realize diverse unprecedented chemical transformations. By combining iridium with chiral thiourea catalysis, direct enantioselective reductive cyanation and phosphonylation of secondary amides have been accomplished for the first time for the synthesis of enantioenriched chiral &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates. The protocol is highly efficient and enantioselective, providing a novel route to the synthesis of optically active &#945;&#8208;functionalized amines from the simple, readily available feedstocks. In addition, the reactions are scalable and the thiourea catalyst can be recycled and reused.

         <title>A Long and Reversibly Self&#8208;Assembling 1D DNA Nanostructure Built from Triplex and Quadruplex Hybrid Tiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8722-8727, April 12, 2021. </description>

A new and reversible 1&#8208;dimensional DNA nanostructure, assembled from DNA triplexes and G&#8208;quadruplexes, is reported. These &#8220;TQ Hybrid&#8221; nanostructures require potassium ions and acidic pH to form and are easily disassembled by removal of either requirement. We anticipate that they will find unique and varied application as communication modules, sensors, logic gates, and in diverse other uses of DNA nanotechnology.







Abstract
We report a new DNA nanostructure, an extended 1&#8208;dimensional composite built for the first time out of structurally robust yet conveniently disassembled DNA triple helices, interspersed with short stretches of G&#8208;quadruplexes. These &#8220;TQ Hybrid&#8221; 1&#8208;dimensional nanostructures require potassium ions and modestly acidic pH for their formation and are easily disassembled by changes to either of these requirements. We initially prepared and characterized a &#8220;monomeric&#8221; TQ Hybrid tile; followed by &#8220;sticky&#8221; TQs tiles, incorporating unique guanine&#8208;only sticky ends, that enable efficient self&#8208;assembly via G&#8208;quartet formation of nanostructures &gt;150&#8197;nm in length, as seen with atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. We anticipate that such DNA TQ Hybrid structures will find unique and varied application as communication modules within larger nanostructures, and as sensors, logic gates, as well as in other aspects of DNA nanotechnology.

         <title>Planar Hexacoordinate Carbons: Half Covalent, Half Ionic</title>

Fifteen global minima of the CE3M3+ (E=S&#8211;Te and M=Li&#8211;Cs) series contain a true planar hexacoordinate carbon. The chemical bonding analyses indicate that the carbon atom is covalently bonded to three chalcogens and ionically connected to the three alkali metals.







Abstract
Herein, the first global minima containing a planar hexacoordinate carbon (phC) atom are reported. The fifteen structures belong to the CE3M3+ (E=S&#8211;Te and M=Li&#8211;Cs) series and satisfy both geometric and electronic criteria to be considered as a true phC. The design strategy consisted of replacing oxygen in the D3h&#8197;CO3Li3+ structure with heavy and less electronegative chalcogens, inducing a negative charge on the C&#8197;atom and an attractive electrostatic interaction between C and the alkali&#8208;metal cations. The chemical bonding analyses indicate that carbon is covalently bonded to three chalcogens and ionically connected to the three alkali metals.

         <title>Cryo&#8208;EM Resolves Molecular Recognition Of An Optojasp Photoswitch Bound To Actin Filaments In Both Switch States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8678-8682, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting actin requires spatiotemporal control of drug activity. Optojasps are photo&#8208;switchable small molecules, providing direct optical spatiotemporal control of the actin cytoskeleton. We present high&#8208;resolution cryo&#8208;EM structures of both isomeric states of an optojasp bound to F&#8208;actin and describe in detail the binding pocket and conformational changes associated with switching of the azobenzene.







Abstract
Actin is essential for key processes in all eukaryotic cells. Cellpermeable optojasps provide spatiotemporal control of the actin cytoskeleton, confining toxicity and potentially rendering F&#8208;actin druggable by photopharmacology. Here, we report cryo electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) structures of both isomeric states of one optojasp bound to actin filaments. The high&#8208;resolution structures reveal for the first time the pronounced effects of photoswitching a functionalized azobenzene. By characterizing the optojasp binding site and identifying conformational changes within F&#8208;actin that depend on the optojasp isomeric state, we refine determinants for the design of functional F&#8208;actin photoswitches.

         <title>Bubble&#8208;Propelled Janus Gallium/Zinc Micromotors for the Active Treatment of Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8750-8754, April 12, 2021. </description>

Janus Ga/Zn micromotors powered by bubbles are presented as an integrated platform with autonomous movement, self&#8208;degradability, and bacteriostatic capacity. The micromotors are applied to the active target treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.







Abstract
We report a bubble&#8208;propelled Janus gallium/zinc (Ga/Zn) micromotor with good biocompatibility and biodegradability for active target treatment of bacteria. The Janus Ga/Zn micromotors are fabricated by asymmetrically coating liquid metal Ga on Zn microparticles and display self&#8208;propulsion in simulated gastroenteric acid (pH&#8197;0.5) at a speed of up to 383&#8197;&#956;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, propelled by hydrogen bubbles generated by the zinc&#8211;acid reaction. This motion of Ga/Zn micromotors is enhanced by the Ga&#8211;Zn galvanic effect. The GaIII cations produced from the degradation of Ga/Zn micromotors serve as a built&#8208;in antibiotic agent. The movement improves the diffusion of GaIII and results in a significant increase of the antibacterial efficiency against H.&#8197;pylori, compared with passive Ga microparticles.

     alt="Bubble&#8208;Propelled Janus Gallium/Zinc Micromotors for the Active Treatment of Bacterial Infections"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janus Ga/Zn micromotors powered by bubbles are presented as an integrated platform with autonomous movement, self&#8208;degradability, and bacteriostatic capacity. The micromotors are applied to the active target treatment of &lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; infection.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a bubble&#8208;propelled Janus gallium/zinc (Ga/Zn) micromotor with good biocompatibility and biodegradability for active target treatment of bacteria. The Janus Ga/Zn micromotors are fabricated by asymmetrically coating liquid metal Ga on Zn microparticles and display self&#8208;propulsion in simulated gastroenteric acid (pH&#8197;0.5) at a speed of up to 383&#8197;&#956;m&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, propelled by hydrogen bubbles generated by the zinc&#8211;acid reaction. This motion of Ga/Zn micromotors is enhanced by the Ga&#8211;Zn galvanic effect. The Ga&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; cations produced from the degradation of Ga/Zn micromotors serve as a built&#8208;in antibiotic agent. The movement improves the diffusion of Ga&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; and results in a significant increase of the antibacterial efficiency against &lt;i&gt;H.&#8197;pylori&lt;/i&gt;, compared with passive Ga microparticles. Such Ga/Zn micromotors combine the self&#8208;propulsion, good biocompatibility and biodegradability, and Ga&#8208;based antibacterial properties, providing a proof of concept for the active treatment of bacterial infections.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Facile Synthesized Polymer Featuring B&#8208;N Covalent Bond and Small Singlet&#8208;Triplet Gap for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8813-8817, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easily synthesized building block BNT and a relevant polymer PBNT&#8208;BDD featuring B&#8208;N covalent bond were synthesized for application in solar cells. The polymer offered a power conversion efficiency of 16.1&#8201;%, a nonradiative recombination energy loss of 0.19&#8197;eV, and a singlet&#8208;triplet gap as low as 0.15&#8197;eV, demonstrating the promising prospect of B&#8208;N&#8208;containing materials in organic photovoltaics.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) largely rely on polymer donors. Herein, we report a new building block BNT and a relevant polymer PBNT&#8208;BDD featuring B&#8208;N covalent bond for application in OSCs. The BNT unit is synthesized in only 3 steps, leading to the facile synthesis of PBNT&#8208;BDD. When blended with a nonfullerene acceptor Y6&#8208;BO, PBNT&#8208;BDD afforded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.1&#8201;% in an OSC, comparable to the benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (BDT)&#8208;based counterpart. The nonradiative recombination energy loss of 0.19&#8197;eV was afforded by PBNT&#8208;BDD. PBNT&#8208;BDD also exhibited weak crystallinity and appropriate miscibility with Y6&#8208;BO, benefitting of morphological stability. The singlet&#8211;triplet gap (&#916;EST) of PBNT&#8208;BDD is as low as 0.15&#8197;eV, which is much lower than those of common organic semiconductors (&#8805;0.6&#8197;eV). As a result, the triplet state of PBNT&#8208;BDD is higher than the charge transfer (CT) state, which would suppress the recombination via triplet state effectively.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Electric Coupling in a Cobalt(II)&#8208;Based Spin Triangle Revealed by Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Modulated Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8832-8838, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This contribution describes the observation of spin&#8211;electric coupling utilizing electric&#8208;field&#8208;modulated ESR (EFM&#8208;ESR) spectroscopy for single&#8208;crystals of a spin triangle which is characterized by the strong magnetic anisotropy of the individual cobalt(II) centers and a pronounced sensitivity of the molecular energy levels on the relative orientation of their magnetic axes as well as the exchange coupling between them.







Abstract
A cobalt(II)&#8208;based spin triangle shows a significant spin&#8211;electric coupling. [Co3(pytag)(py)6Cl3]ClO4&#8901;3&#8201;py crystallizes in the acentric monoclinic space group P21. The intra&#8208;triangle antiferromagnetic interaction, of the order of ca. &#8722;15&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (H=&#8722;JSaSb), leads to spin frustration. The two expected energy&#8208;degenerate ground doublets are, however, separated by a few wavenumbers, as a consequence of magnetic anisotropy and deviations from threefold symmetry. The Co3&#8197;planes of symmetry&#8208;related molecules are almost parallel, allowing for the determination of the spin&#8211;electric properties of single crystals by EFM&#8208;ESR spectroscopy. The spin&#8211;electric effect detected when the electric field is applied in the Co3&#8197;plane was revealed by a shift in the resonance field. It was quantified as &#916;gE/E=0.11&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;m&#8201;V&#8722;1, which in terms of frequency corresponds to approximately 0.3&#8197;Hz&#8201;m&#8201;V&#8722;1. This value is comparable to what was determined for a Cu3&#8197;triangle despite the antiferromagnetic interaction being 20&#8197;times larger for the latter.

         <title>Stable Thermotropic 3D and 2D Double Gyroid Nanostructures with Sub&#8208;2&#8208;nm Feature Size from Scalable Sugar&#8211;Polyolefin Conjugates</title>

Ultra&#8208;low molecular weight disaccharide&#8211;polyolefin conjugates with cellobiose, lactose and maltose head groups and atactic polypropene tails, such as 1, provide highly ordered and exceptionally stable thermotropic hexagonal perforated lamellar (HPL) and double gyroid (DG) nanostructured phases. The unique stability of this DG phase extends further down to the two&#8208;dimensional limit of 15 nm in which film thickness, l, is now less than the surface&#8208;oriented unit cell height, hDG.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;low molecular weight disaccharide&#8211;polyolefin conjugates with cellobiose, lactose and maltose head groups and atactic polypropene tails, such as 1, undergo a series of irreversible thermotropic order&#8211;order transitions with increasing temperature to provide nanostructured phases in the sequence: lamellar (L), hexagonal perforated lamellar (HPL), double gyroid (DG) and hexagonal cylindrical (C). The DG phase displays exceptional stability at ambient temperature and features two interpenetrating sugar domain networks having a sub&#8208;2&#8208;nm strut width and a lattice parameter, aDG, of 13.1&#8197;nm. The unique stability of this DG phase extends further within ultrathin films all the way down to the two&#8208;dimensional limit of 15&#8197;nm in which film thickness, l, is now less than the surface&#8208;oriented unit cell height, hDG. In addition to raising the fundamental question of what minimally constitutes a Schoen triply periodic minimal surface and DG lattice, these results serve to establish the class of sugar&#8211;polyolefin conjugates as a new material platform for nanoscience and nanotechnology.

The asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;amino esters has been achieved, in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities, employing sequence diverse metagenomic imine reductases (IREDs).







Abstract
N&#8208;Substituted &#945;&#8208;amino esters are widely used as chiral intermediates in a range of pharmaceuticals. Here we report the enantioselective biocatalyic synthesis of N&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;amino esters through the direct reductive coupling of &#945;&#8208;ketoesters and amines employing sequence diverse metagenomic imine reductases (IREDs). Both enantiomers of N&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;amino esters were obtained with high conversion and excellent enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions. In addition &gt;20 different preparative scale transformations were performed highlighting the scalability of this system.

         <title>Blatter&#8208;Radical&#8208;Grafted Mesoporous Silica as Prospective Nanoplatform for Spin Manipulation at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8683-8688, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extremely stable Blatter's type organic radicals grafted into the mesoporous silica show advanced relaxation properties at room temperature. Electron spin decoherence time exceeds that in many other qubit candidates, allowing efficient spin manipulation at ambient conditions. The tuneable multifunctional nature of such composite materials promotes them as promising nanoplatforms for developing new spin&#8208;based quantum bits.







Abstract
Quantum computing and quantum information processing (QC/QIP) crucially depend on the availability of suitable quantum bits (qubits) and methods of their manipulation. Most qubit candidates known to date are not applicable at ambient conditions. Herein, we propose radical&#8208;grafted mesoporous silica as a versatile and prospective nanoplatform for spin&#8208;based QC/QIP. Extremely stable Blatter&#8208;type organic radicals are used, whose electron spin decoherence time is profoundly long even at room temperature (up to Tm&#8776;2.3&#8197;&#956;s), thus allowing efficient spin manipulation by microwave pulses. The mesoporous structure of such composites is nuclear&#8208;spin free and provides additional opportunities of embedding guest molecules into the channels. Robustness and tunability of these materials promotes them as highly promising nanoplatforms for future QC/QIP developments.

An efficient electrochemical radical silyl&#8208;oxygenation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes is demonstrated, which gives access to a variety of highly functionalized silicon&#8208;containing molecules, including &#946;&#8208;silyl&#8208;cyanohydrin derivatives in good yields with excellent chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity under mild conditions without the use of transition&#8208;metal catalyst or chemical oxidant.







Abstract
An efficient electrochemical radical silyl&#8208;oxygenation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes is demonstrated, which gives access to a variety of new highly functionalized silicon&#8208;containing molecules, including &#946;&#8208;silyl&#8208;cyanohydrin derivatives in good yields with excellent chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity. This electrochemical radical silylation process conducts under mild conditions without the use of transition metal catalyst or chemical oxidant and exhibits a wide scope of substrate silanes with high functional&#8208;group tolerance. The ability to access silyl radicals using electrochemical Si&#8722;H activation offers new perspectives for the synthesis of valuable organosilicon compounds in a sustainable and green manner.

         <title>A Desaturase&#8208;Like Enzyme Catalyzes Oxazole Formation in Pseudomonas Indolyloxazole Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8781-8785, April 12, 2021. </description>

Indolyloxazole alkaloids are widespread natural products with diverse bioactivities but previously unknown biosynthesis. Transposon mutagenesis, heterologous pathway expression, and labeling experiments provide evidence for a Pseudomonas pathway involving oxazole formation by cyclization as a new reaction type catalyzed by a desaturase&#8208;like enzyme.







Abstract
Indolyloxazole alkaloids occur in diverse micro&#8208; and macroorganisms and exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities. Despite their ubiquitous occurrence and simple structures, the biosynthetic pathway remained unknown. Here, we used transposon mutagenesis in the labradorin producer Pseudomonas entomophila to identify a cryptic biosynthetic locus encoding an N&#8208;acyltransferase and a non&#8208;heme diiron desaturase&#8208;like enzyme. Heterologous expression in E. coli demonstrates that both enzymes are sufficient to produce indolyloxazoles. Probing their function in stable&#8208;isotope feeding experiments, we provide evidence for an unusual desaturase mechanism that generates the oxazole by decarboxylative cyclization.

         <title>Chiral Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores by Self&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Coupling of Cationic Helicenes with Amines/Enamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8733-8738, April 12, 2021. </description>

Cationic dioxa[6]helicene oxidizes alkyl amines to enamines and further reacts in situ as an electrophile to form, in one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;step cascades, fully delocalized mono or bis donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor coupling products. This original approach provides chiral cyanine&#8208;like chromophores that absorb up to the NIR and fluoresce alike, with intense NIR ECD (&#916;&#1013; up to 60&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1). DFT showcases the importance of conformers in the strong chiroptical response.







Abstract
In one pot, tertiary alkyl amines are oxidized to enamines by cationic dioxa[6]helicene, which further reacts as electrophile and oxidant to form mono or bis donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor coupling products. This original and convergent synthetic approach provides a strong extension of conjugation yielding chromophores that absorb intensively in far&#8208;red or NIR domains (&#955;max up to 791&#8197;nm) and fluoresce in the NIR as well (&#955;max up to 887&#8197;nm). Intense ECD properties around 790&#8197;nm with a |&#916;&#1013;| value up to 60&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 are observed.

         <title>Implications of Quenching&#8208;to&#8208;Dequenching Switch in Quantitative Cell Uptake and Biodistribution of Dye&#8208;Labeled Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general strategy to carry out cell uptake and biodistribution studies is to label nanoparticles (NPs) with a fluorescent dye. However, the comparative study of different dye&#8208;loaded NPs remains difficult due to uncontrolled dye quenching and de&#8208;quenching. Here we compared two types of dye&#8208;labeled NPs and demonstrated their distinct properties. NPs with dye molecules at a solid state suffer from dye quenching, so the dye release and/or NP degradation in biological environments leads to a several&#8208;fold increase of fluorescence intensity despite the same amount of NPs, due to the state switch from quenching to de&#8208;quenching. In contrast, NPs with dye molecules at a soluble state exhibit no quenching effect. To standardize the comparative study, we propose two possible solutions: using lower dye loading, or using medium analysis for quantifying cell uptake of NPs. This work provides valuable insights into selecting valid quantification methods for bio&#8208;nano studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Triptycene&#8208;based Chiral Porous Polyimides for Enantioselective Membrane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A couple of enantiomers of 2, 6&#8208;diaminotriptycene (  R, R  &#8208;  1  and  S, S  &#8208;  1  ) are split by chiral HPLC and their absolute configurations are identified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction technology. Using the enantiomers as monomers, a couple of chiral porous polyimides (  R  &#8208;  FTPI  and  S  &#8208;  FTPI  ) are prepared by polycondensation reactions and display good heat stability, high BET surface area and good solubility in organic solvents. Moreover, both of  R  &#8208;  FTPI  and  S  &#8208;  FTPI  can be cast into robust, free&#8208;standing films suitable for enantioselective separation with symmetrical chiral selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Ketones from Methyl Esters by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct conversion of alkyl esters to ketones has been hindered by the sluggish reactivity of the starting materials and the susceptibility of the product towards subsequent nucleophilic attack. We have now achieved a cross&#8208;coupling approach to this transformation using nickel, a bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, and alkyl organoboron coupling partners. 65 alkyl ketones bearing diverse functional groups and heterocyclic scaffolds have been synthesized with this method. Catalyst&#8208;controlled chemoselectivity is observed for C(acyl)&#8211;O bond activation of multi&#8208;functional substrates bearing other bonds prone to cleavage by Ni, including aryl ether, aryl fluoride, and N&#8208;Ph amide functional groups. Density functional theory calculations provide mechanistic support for a Ni(0)/Ni(II) catalytic cycle and demonstrate how stabilizing non&#8208;covalent interactions between the bulky catalyst and substrate are critical for the reaction&#8217;s success.</dc:description>

         <title>Light Emitting Metal&#8208;Organic Halide 1D and 2D Structures: Near&#8208;unity Quantum Efficiency, Low&#8208;loss Optical Waveguide and Highly Polarized Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8722;inorganic metal&#8208;halide materials (OIMMs) with zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structure have recently attracted increasing attention owing to their excellent optical properties and widely photo&#8208;functional applications. However, successful examples of 0D structural OIMMs with well&#8208;defined optical&#160; performance at micro&#8208;/nanometer size are still quite limited. Here, we design and synthesise&#160; a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) (DTA)  2  SbCl  5  &#183;DTAC (DTAC=Dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride) single crystal micro&#8208;rod and 2D micro&#8208;plates with 0D structure, in which individual (SbCl  5  )  2&#8208;  quadrangular units are completely isolated and surrounded by the organic cation DTA  +  . Experimental results indicate that the organic molecular unit with a long alkyl chain (C  12  ) and three methyl groups enables the formation of micro&#8208;rods and micro&#8208;plates. The single crystal micro&#8208; rods/plates exhibit a broadband orange emission peak at 610 nm with a photoluminescence&#160; quantum yield (PLQY) of around 90% and a large Stokes shift of 260 nm under photoexcitation. The broad emission originates from self&#8208;trapping excitons as determined by the joint experiment&#8208;theory studies. Spatially resolved PL spectra confirm that the micro&#8208;rods exhibit an optical waveguide effect with low waveguide loss coefficient (0.0019 dB &#956;m  &#8208;1  ) during propagation, and linear polarized photoemission with polarization contrast (0.57). These features present a new direction towards the design of 0D OIMMs with various morphologies, which also further extend the applications of 0D OIMMs to potential optical communication micro&#8208;devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient (&gt;20%) and Stable All&#8208;inorganic Cesium Lead Triiodide Solar Cell Enabled by Thiocyanate Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Besides widely&#8208;used surface passivation, engineering the film crystallization is an important and more fundamental route to improve the performance of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cells. Herein, we have developed a urea&#8208;ammonium thiocyanate (UAT) molten salt modification strategy to fully release and exploit coordination activities of SCN&#8208; to deposit high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 film for efficient and stable all&#8208;inorganic solar cells. The UAT is derived by the hydrogen bond interactions between urea and NH4+ from NH4SCN. With the UAT, the crystal quality of the CsPbI3 film has been significantly improved and a long single&#8208;exponential charge recombination lifetime of over 30 ns has been achieved. With these benefits, the cell efficiency has been promoted to over 20% (steady&#8208;state efficiency of 19.2%) with excellent operational stability over 1000 h. These results demonstrate a promising development route of the CsPbI3 related photoelectric devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Freezing&#8208;assisted Conjugation of Unmodified Diblock DNA to Hydrogel Nanoparticles and Monoliths for DNA and Hg2+ Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acrydite&#8208;modified DNA is the most frequently used reagent to prepare DNA&#8208;functionalized hydrogels. Herein, we show that unmodified penta&#8208;adenine (A5) can reach up to 75% conjugation efficiency in 8 h under a freezing polymerization condition in polyacrylamide hydrogels. DNA incorporation efficiency was reduced by forming duplex or other folded structures and by removing the freezing condition. By designing diblock DNA containing an A5 block, various functional DNA sequences were attached. Such hydrogels were designed for ultrasensitive DNA hybridization and Hg2+ detection, with detection limits of 50 pM and 10 nM, respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of using unmodified DNA to replace acrydite&#8208;DNA. The same method worked for both gel nanoparticles and monoliths. This work revealed interesting reaction products by exploiting freezing and has provided a cost&#8208;effective way to attach DNA to hydrogels.</dc:description>

&#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin has dramatic consequences on the solution behaviour of molybdates. Small angle X&#8208;ray scattering analysis (SAXS) reveals the formation of large nanoscopic Mo&#8208;based oligomers that give rise to the fast formation of supramolecular core&#8211;shell type systems. This behaviour has been attributed to the chaotropic effect able to amplify very weak supramolecular interaction and then generates sophisticated non&#8208;covalent hierarchical assemblies.







Abstract
Herein, we show how the chaotropic effect arising from reduced molybdate ions in acidified aqueous solution is able to amplify drastically weak supramolecular interactions.

&lt;p&gt;&#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin has dramatic consequences on the solution behaviour of molybdates. Small angle X&#8208;ray scattering analysis (SAXS) reveals the formation of large nanoscopic Mo&#8208;based oligomers that give rise to the fast formation of supramolecular core&#8211;shell type systems. This behaviour has been attributed to the chaotropic effect able to amplify very weak supramolecular interaction and then generates sophisticated non&#8208;covalent hierarchical assemblies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we show how the chaotropic effect arising from reduced molybdate ions in acidified aqueous solution is able to amplify drastically weak supramolecular interactions. Time&#8208;resolved Small Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (SAXS) analysis suggests that molybdenum&#8208;blue oligomeric species form huge aggregates in the presence of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD) which results in the fast formation of nanoscopic {Mo&lt;sub&gt;154&lt;/sub&gt;}&#8208;based host&#8208;guest species, while X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the ending&#8208;point of the scenario results in an unprecedented three&#8208;component well&#8208;ordered core&#8211;shell&#8208;like motif. A similar arrangement was found by using preformed hexarhenium chalcogenide&#8208;type cluster [Re&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as exogenous guest.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Catabolic Multifunctional DNAzyme Nanosponge for Programmable Drug Delivery and Efficient Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exquisite cascade DNAzyme&#8208;sustained gene silencing platform was assembled to program the &#8220;mask&#8208;cleave&#8208;release&#8221; of therapeutic DNAzyme from the intelligent DNAzyme nanosponge, where the upstream self&#8208;catabolic DNAzyme mediated the specific and accurate activation of downstream therapeutic DNAzyme for guaranteeing the efficient gene silencing with improved bioavailability.







Abstract
DNAzyme&#8208;based gene therapy holds immense prospects for effectively treating severe diseases, yet is constrained with inefficient delivery and unconditional activation. Herein, we designed a bioinspired self&#8208;catabolic DNA nanocapsule for sustaining tumor&#8208;specific cascade activation of therapeutic DNAzyme. The exquisite DNAzyme was temporarily masked by the self&#8208;excising DNAzyme in the hierarchical rolling circle replication (RCR) nanostructures, thus stayed in an inactive state in physiological fluids. Through the multivalent tumor&#8208;anchoring aptamer strands, the RCR nanocapsule was specifically accumulated in cancer cells and was sequentially activated for motivating the ultimate DNAzyme&#8208;mediated gene silencing via the intelligent stimuli&#8208;responsive cascade DNAzyme activation. By virtue of the programmable RCR assembly strategy, our compact DNAzyme nanoplatform shows great promise for developing versatile smart gene therapeutics and personalized nanomedicines.

         <title>Effective Encapsulation of C60 by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Polyamide Macrocyclic Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ditopic flexible benzylic amide macrocycle was employed as an organic ligand for the assembly of metal&#8211;organic frameworks. These reticular materials form non&#8208;interpenetrated channels with a remarkable solvent&#8208;accessible volume of 46&#8201;%. The incorporation of fullerene C60 inside the adjustable pockets of these materials was studied, and C60 was able to occupy an impressive 98&#8201;% of them. These materials were selective for the recognition of C60 in the presence of the larger C70.







Abstract
A flexible benzylic amide macrocycle, functionalized with two carboxylic acid groups, was employed as the organic ligand for the preparation of robust copper(II)&#8208; and zinc(II)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks. These polymers crystallized in the C2/m space group of the monoclinic crystal system, creating non&#8208;interpenetrated channels in one direction with an extraordinary solvent&#8208;accessible volume of 46&#8201;%. Unlike metal&#8211;organic rotaxane frameworks having benzylic amide macrocycles as linkers, the absence of the thread in these novel reticular materials causes a decrease of dimensionality and an improvement of pore size and dynamic guest adaptability. We studied the incorporation of fullerene C60 inside the adjustable pocket generated between two macrocycles connected to the same dinuclear clusters, occupying a remarkable 98&#8201;% of the cavities inside the network. The use of these materials as hosts for the selective recognition of different fullerenes was evaluated, mainly encapsulating the smaller size fullerene derivative in several mixtures of C60 and C70.

         <title>Solar and Visible Light Assisted Peptide Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide coupling reaction is described that relies mechanistically on sunlight activation of a 4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;pyridine&#8211;alkyl halide charge&#8208;transfer complex to generate a novel coupling reagent in situ. Experimental and computational studies support the proposed mechanism.







Abstract
Amino acid and peptide couplings are widely used in fields related to pharma and materials. Still, current peptide synthesis continues to rely on the use of expensive, water sensitive, and waste&#8208;generating coupling reagents, which are often prepared in multi&#8208;step sequences and used in excess. Herein is described a peptide coupling reaction design that relies mechanistically on sun&#8208;light activation of a 4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;pyridine&#8211;alkyl halide charge&#8208;transfer complex to generate a novel coupling reagent in situ. The resulting coupling method is rapid, does not require dry solvents or inert atmosphere, and is compatible with all the most common amino acids and protecting groups. Peptide couplings can be run on gram&#8208;scale, without the use of special equipment. This method has a significantly reduced environmental and financial footprint compared to standard peptide coupling reactions. Experimental and computational studies support the proposed mechanism.

         <title>The hydrotropic effect of ionic liquids in water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes have successfully expanded the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes beyond 2&#160;V. Further improvements in stability can be achieved by partially substituting water with either classical organic solvents or ionic liquids. Here, we study ternary electrolytes composed of LiTFSI, water, and imidazolium ionic liquids. We find that the LiTFSI solubility strongly increases from 21&#160;mol/kg in water to up to 60 mol/kg in the presence of ionic liquid. The solution structure is investigated with Raman and NMR spectroscopy and the enhanced LiTFSI solubility is found to originate from a hydrotropic effect of the ionic liquids. The increased reductive stability of the ternary electrolytes enables stable cycling of an aqueous lithium&#8208;ion battery with an energy density of 150&#160;Wh/kg on the active material level based on commercially relevant Li4Ti5O12 and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Cooperated Catalytic Mechanism of Atomically Dispersed Cu&#8208;N4 and Zn&#8208;N4 for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual metal single atom catalysts exhibit superior performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), however, the synergistic catalytic mechanism is not deeply understood. Herein, we report a dual metal single atom catalyst consisted of Cu&#8208;N4  and Zn&#8208;N4  on the N&#8208;doped carbon support (Cu/Zn&#8208;NC). It exhibits high&#8208;efficiency ORR activity with an  E  onset  of 0.98 V and an  E  1/2  of 0.83 V, excellent stability (no degradation after 10000 cycles), surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C and great mass of Pt&#8208;free single atom catalysts. Operando XANES demonstrates that the Cu&#8208;N4  as active center experiences the change from atomic dispersion to cluster with the cooperation of Zn&#8208;N4  during ORR process, and then turns to single atom state again after reaction. DFT calculation further indicates that the adjustment effect of Zn on the d&#8208;orbital electron distribution of Cu could benefit to the stretch and cleavage of O&#8208;O on Cu active center, speeding up the process of rate determining step of OOH*.</dc:description>

Operando XANES demonstrates that the Cu&#8208;N4  as active center experiences the change from atomic dispersion to cluster with the cooperation of Zn&#8208;N4  during ORR process, and then turns to single atom state again after reaction. DFT calculation further indicates that the adjustment effect of Zn on the d&#8208;orbital electron distribution of Cu could benefit to the stretch and cleavage of O&#8208;O on Cu active center, speeding up the process of rate determining step of OOH*.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Role of Metal Substitution in Tuning Anion Redox in Sodium Metal Layered Oxides Revealed by X&#8208;Ray Spectroscopy and Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The link between the high&#8208;valent structure of P2&#8208;type sodium layered transition metal oxides and the redox properties involving oxygen redox is demonstrated. By substituting Fe with Cu and Ni from P2&#8208;Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2, the antisite&#8208;vacancy defect formation is controlled during desodiation of the positive electrodes. Ligand to metal charge transfer and the O 2p state near the Fermi level evoke and stabilize oxygen redox from the electrodes.







Abstract
We investigate high&#8208;valent oxygen redox in the positive Na&#8208;ion electrode P2&#8208;Na0.67&#8722;x[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O2 (NMF) where Fe is partially substituted with Cu (P2&#8208;Na0.67&#8722;x[Mn0.66Fe0.20Cu0.14]O2, NMFC) or Ni (P2&#8208;Na0.67&#8722;x[Mn0.65Fe0.20Ni0.15]O2, NMFN). From combined analysis of resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering and X&#8208;ray near&#8208;edge structure with electrochemical voltage hysteresis and X&#8208;ray pair distribution function profiles, we correlate structural disorder with high&#8208;valent oxygen redox and its improvement by Ni or Cu substitution. Density of states calculations elaborate considerable anionic redox in NMF and NMFC without the widely accepted requirement of an A&#8208;O&#8208;A&#8242; local configuration in the pristine materials (where A=Na and A&#8242;=Li, Mg, vacancy, etc.). We also show that the Jahn&#8211;Teller nature of Fe4+ and the stabilization mechanism of anionic redox could determine the extent of structural disorder in the materials. These findings shed light on the design principles in TM and anion redox for positive electrodes to improve the performance of Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Decarboxylative Polyfluoroarylation of Alkylcarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyzed decarboxylative polyfluoroarylation of aliphatic carboxylic acids is reported. The defluorinative C&#8722;C bond formation through a radical process enables expedient access to polyfluoroaromatics from abundant carboxylic acids.







Abstract
Polyfluoroarenes are useful building blocks in several areas such as drug discovery, materials, and crop protection. Herein, we report the first polyfluoroarylation of aliphatic carboxylic acids via photoredox decarboxylation. The method proceeds with broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. Moreover, small complex molecules such as natural products and drugs can be modified by late&#8208;stage modification.

         <title>Impact of In&#8208;Cell and In&#8208;Vitro Crowding on the Conformations and Dynamics of an Intrinsically Disordered Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;cell single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy reveals the effects of intracellular crowding on the dimensions and dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins.







Abstract
The conformations and dynamics of proteins can be influenced by crowding from the large concentrations of macromolecules within cells. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) exhibit chain compaction in crowded solutions in vitro, but no such effects were observed in cultured mammalian cells. Here, to increase intracellular crowding, we reduced the cell volume by hyperosmotic stress and used an IDP as a crowding sensor for in&#8208;cell single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy. In these more crowded cells, the IDP exhibits compaction, slower chain dynamics, and much slower translational diffusion, indicating a pronounced concentration and length&#8208;scale dependence of crowding. In vitro, these effects cannot be reproduced with small but only with large polymeric crowders. The observations can be explained with polymer theory and depletion interactions and indicate that IDPs can diffuse much more efficiently through a crowded cytosol than a globular protein of similar dimensions.

         <title>Enhanced Catalysis under 2D Silica: A CO Oxidation Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO oxidation taking place under a 2D microporous silicon dioxide film demonstrates a &#8764;12&#8201;% enhancement in CO2 production by creating an interfacial microenvironment that fosters a higher coverage of reactive Pd surface oxide sites that are integral to CO2 conversion.







Abstract
Interfacially confined microenvironments have recently gained attention in catalysis, as they can be used to modulate reaction chemistry. The emergence of a 2D nanospace at the interface between a 2D material and its support can promote varying kinetic and energetic schemes based on molecular level confinement effects imposed in this reduced volume. We report on the use of a 2D oxide cover, bilayer silica, on catalytically active Pd(111) undergoing the CO oxidation reaction. We &#8220;uncover&#8221; mechanistic insights about the structure&#8211;activity relationship with and without a 2D silica overlayer using in situ IR and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and mass spectrometry methods. We find that the CO oxidation reaction on Pd(111) benefits from confinement effects imposed on surface adsorbates under 2D silica. This interaction results in a lower and more dispersed coverage of CO adsorbates with restricted CO adsorption geometries, which promote oxygen adsorption and lay the foundation for the formation of a reactive surface oxide that produces higher CO2 formation rates than Pd alone.

         <title>Effect of Zinc&#8208;Doping on the Reduction of the Hot&#8208;Carrier Cooling Rate in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proper Zn&#8208;doping (0.34&#8201;%) in perovskites is found to be able to significantly slowdown the hot&#8208;carrier cooling, the cooling rate of the 500&#8197;K hot&#8208;carriers can be reduced down to one third of the un&#8208;doped sample. Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations uncover the mechanisms of such efficient retardation of the hot&#8208;carrier cooling via Zn&#8208;doping.







Abstract
The fast hot&#8208;carrier cooling process in the solar&#8208;absorbers fundamentally limits their photon&#8208;conversion efficiencies. It is highly desirable to develop a solar absorber with long&#8208;lived hot&#8208;carriers at sun&#8208;illumination intensity, which can be used to develop the hot&#8208;carrier solar cells with enhanced efficiency. Herein, we reveal that zinc&#8208;doped (0.34&#8201;%) halide perovskites have the slower hot&#8208;carrier cooling compared with the pristine sample through the transient absorption spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations. The hot&#8208;carrier energy loss rate at the low photoexcitation level of 1017&#8197;cm&#8722;3 is found to be &#8776;3 times smaller than that of un&#8208;doped perovskites for T=500&#8197;K hot carriers, and up to ten times when the hot&#8208;carrier temperature approaches the lattice temperature. The incorporation of zinc&#8208;dopant into perovskites can reduce the nonadiabatic couplings between conduction bands, which retards the photogenerated hot&#8208;carriers relaxation processes. Our findings present a practical strategy to slow down the hot&#8208;carrier cooling in perovskites at low carrier densities, which would be invaluable for the further development of practical hot&#8208;carrier photovoltaics based on perovskites.

The hot&#8208;carrier energy loss rate at the low photoexcitation level of 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; is found to be &#8776;3 times smaller than that of un&#8208;doped perovskites for T=500&#8197;K hot carriers, and up to ten times when the hot&#8208;carrier temperature approaches the lattice temperature. The incorporation of zinc&#8208;dopant into perovskites can reduce the nonadiabatic couplings between conduction bands, which retards the photogenerated hot&#8208;carriers relaxation processes. Our findings present a practical strategy to slow down the hot&#8208;carrier cooling in perovskites at low carrier densities, which would be invaluable for the further development of practical hot&#8208;carrier photovoltaics based on perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination Toward a Photoinduced Single&#8208;Chain Magnet Showing High Coercivity Values</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;induced spin&#8208;crossover switchable single&#8208;chain magnet was discovered in an asymmetric ditopic ligand&#8208;containing cyanide&#8208;bridged compound. A photoinduced opening hysteresis with the highest coercive field of 1.3&#8197;T was realized in pure 3d metal&#8208;based molecular magnets.







Abstract
The production of photo&#8208;switchable molecular nanomagnets with substantial coercivity, which is indispensable for information storage and process applications, is challenging. Introducing photo&#8208;responsive spin&#8208;crossover units provides a feasible means of controlling the magnetic anisotropy, interactions, and overall nanomagnet properties. Herein, we report a cyanide&#8208;bridged chain 1&#8901;12H2O ({[(PzTp)FeIII(CN)3]2FeII(Pmat)2}n&#8901;12&#8201;H2O) generated by linking the FeII&#8208;based spin&#8208;crossover unit with the [(PzTp)Fe(CN)3]&#8722; (PzTp: tetrakis(pyrazolyl)borate) building block in the presence of asymmetric ditopic ligand Pmat ((4&#8208;pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyleneamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole). Structural characterization revealed that the introduction of this asymmetric ligand led to a distorted coordination environment of FeII ions, which were equatorially coordinated by four cyanide N atoms, and apically coordinated by one pyridine N atom and one triazole N atom. Upon 808&#8208;nm light irradiation, 1&#8901;12H2O underwent photoinduced spin&#8208;crossover and exhibited single&#8208;chain magnet behavior with a coercive field of up to 1.3&#8197;T. This represents a 3d&#8208;based photoinduced single&#8208;chain magnet exhibiting pronounced hysteresis.

         <title>Prebiotic Phosphorylation and Concomitant Oligomerization of Deoxynucleosides to form DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorylation of deoxyribonucleosides under plausible prebiotic conditions with diamidophosphate gives rise to 5&#8242;&#8208;amidophosphorylated nucleotides and concomitantly to the 3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;linked DNA oligomers. This direct conversion of deoxynucleosides to DNA oligonucleotides in a single pot scenario&#8212;under conditions compatible with ribonucleosides&#8212;sets the stage for the potential emergence of RNA and DNA from mixtures of nucleosides.







Abstract
Recent demonstrations of RNA&#8211;DNA chimeras (RDNA) enabling RNA and DNA replication, coupled with prebiotic co&#8208;synthesis of deoxyribo&#8208; and ribo&#8208;nucleotides, have resurrected the hypothesis of co&#8208;emergence of RNA and DNA. As further support, we show that diamidophosphate (DAP) with 2&#8208;aminoimidazole (amido)phosphorylates and oligomerizes deoxynucleosides to form DNA&#8212;under conditions similar to those of ribonucleosides. The pyrimidine deoxynucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;amidophosphates are formed in good (&#8776;60&#8201;%) yields. Intriguingly, the presence of pyrimidine deoxynucleos(t)ides increased the yields of purine deoxynucleotides (&#8776;20&#8201;%). Concomitantly, oligomerization (&#8776;18&#8211;31&#8201;%) is observed with predominantly 3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;phosphodiester DNA linkages, and some (&lt;5&#8201;%) pyrophosphates. Combined with previous observations of DAP&#8208;mediated chemistries and the constructive role of RDNA chimeras, the results reported here help set the stage for systematic investigation of a systems chemistry approach of RNA&#8211;DNA coevolution.

         <title>Ultrastable and Efficient Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 Reduction Triggered by Regenerative Oxygen&#8208;vacancies in Bi2O2CO3 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface vacancies can exert positive impact on CO2 photoreduction activity, yet difficultly maintaining long&#8208;term stability. Herein, we first design a fast low&#8208;pressure ultraviolet light irradiation strategy for easily regenerating the nearly equivalent surface vacancies, thus concurrently optimizing CO2 photoreduction activity and stability. Taking the defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets as an example, nearly equal amount of oxygen vacancies can be regenerated under UV light irradiation. Synchrotron&#8208;radiation quasi in&#8208;situ X&#8211;ray photoelectron spectra disclose the Bi sites in the O&#8208;defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets can act as the highly active sites, which not only help to activate CO2 molecules, but also contribute to stabilizing the rate&#8208;limiting COOH* intermediate. Also, in&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and in&#8208;situ mass spectrometry unravel the UV light irradiation contributes to accelerating CO desorption process. As a result, the O&#8208;defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets achieve a stability up to 2640 h over 110 cycling tests and a high evolution rate of 275 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to CO. This study offers a new way for developing sustainable CO2 reduction photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrocarbons Separation and Purification with Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrocarbons, including methane, ethene, propene, para&#8208;xylene and ortho&#8208;xylene, are of great significance in current and future chemical industry. Separation and purification of hydrocarbons, such as methane/nitrogen, ethene/ethane, propene/propane and separation of C8 aromatics, are important processes. Nevertheless, traditional distillation&#8208;based separation accounts for a large portion of the world&#8217;s energy consumption. Porous materials&#8208;based separation is believed to be a promising alternative technology with lower energy consumption and operational cost. This review focuses on the developments of the adsorptive separation of methane/nitrogen, ethene/ethane, propene/propane mixtures as well as on the separation of C8 aromatics (i.e., xylene isomers) with a wide variety of materials, including carbonaceous materials, zeolites, metal&#8208;organic frameworks and porous&#8208;organic frameworks. Some recent important developments for these adsorptive separations are also highlighted. The advantages and disadvantages of each material category are discussed and guidelines for the design of improved materials are proposed. Furthermore, challenges and future developments of each material type and separation processes are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Reorganization of self&#8208;assembled DNA&#8208;based polymers using orthogonally addressable building blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature uses the breaking and making of non&#8208;covalent interactions to achieve the reversible formation and structural reconfiguration of biopolymers, a strategy that permits dynamic adaptation in response to external cues and to changes in the environment. Inspired by this observation and taking advantage of the addressability and programmability of DNA/DNA non&#8208;covalent interactions we report here the rational design of orthogonal DNA&#8208;based addressable tiles that self&#8208;assemble into polymer&#8208;like structures that can be reconfigured and reorganized by external inputs. The different tiles share the same 5&#8208;nucleotide sticky ends responsible for self&#8208;assembly but are rationally designed to contain a specific regulator&#8208;binding domain that can be orthogonally targeted by different DNA regulator strands (activators and inhibitors).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nature uses the breaking and making of non&#8208;covalent interactions to achieve the reversible formation and structural reconfiguration of biopolymers, a strategy that permits dynamic adaptation in response to external cues and to changes in the environment. Inspired by this observation and taking advantage of the addressability and programmability of DNA/DNA non&#8208;covalent interactions we report here the rational design of orthogonal DNA&#8208;based addressable tiles that self&#8208;assemble into polymer&#8208;like structures that can be reconfigured and reorganized by external inputs. The different tiles share the same 5&#8208;nucleotide sticky ends responsible for self&#8208;assembly but are rationally designed to contain a specific regulator&#8208;binding domain that can be orthogonally targeted by different DNA regulator strands (activators and inhibitors). We show that by sequentially adding specific activators and inhibitors it is possible to re&#8208;organize in a dynamic and reversible way the formed polymer&#8208;like structures to display well&#8208;defined distributions: homopolymers made of a single tile, random polymers in which different tiles are distributed randomly and block structures in which the tiles are organized in segments. The versatility of the systems presented in this study shows the ease with which DNA&#8208;based addressable monomers can be designed to create reconfigurable synthetic micron&#8208;scale DNA structures offering a new approach to the growing field of supramolecular polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Control of Triplet Blinking Using Cyclooctatetraene to Access the Dynamics of Biomolecules at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To explore the dynamics of biomolecules, tracing the kinetics of photo&#8208;induced chemical reactions via the triplet excited state (T1) of probe molecules offers a timescale that is ~10^6  &#160;  times wider than via the singlet excited state (S1). Here, using cyclooctatetraene (COT) as a triplet energy acceptor and at the same time as a photostabilizer, the triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (TTET) kinetics governed by oligonucleotide (oligo) dynamics were studied at the single&#8208;molecule level by measuring fluorescence blinking. TTET kinetics measurement allowed us to access the length&#8208; and sequence&#8208;dependent dynamics of oligos, and realize the single&#8208;molecule detection of a model microRNA biomarker. In sharp contrast to the singlet&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that occurs in the 1&#8211;10 nm range, TTET requires a Van der Waals contact. Thus, the present method serves as a complementary method to FRET and provides direct information on biomolecular dynamics on the &#956;s to ms timescale.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Assemblies of Thiophosphopeptides Instantly Target Golgi Apparatus and Selectively Kill Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Golgi apparatus is emerging as a key signaling hub of cells and an important target for cancer therapy, but there are few approaches for targeting Golgi and selectively killing cancer cells. Here we show an unexpected result that changing an oxygen atom of the phosphoester bond in phosphopeptides by a sulfur atom enables instantly targeting Golgi apparatus (GA) and selectively killing cancer cells by enzymatic self&#8208;assembly. Specifically, conjugating cysteamine S&#8208;phosphate to the C&#8208;terminal of a self&#8208;assembling peptide generates a thiophosphopeptide. Being a substrate of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the thiophosphopeptide undergoes rapid ALP&#8208;catalyzed dephosphorylation to form a thiopeptide that self&#8208;assembles. The thiophosphopeptide enters cells via caveolin&#8208;mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis and instantly accumulates in GA because of dephosphorylation and formation of disulfide bonds in Golgi by themselves and with Golgi proteins. Moreover, the thiophosphopeptide potently and selectively inhibits cancer cells (e.g., HeLa) with the IC  50  (about 3 &#956;M), which is an order of magnitude more potent than that of the parent phosphopeptide. This work, as the first report of thiophosphopeptide for targeting Golgi, illustrates a new molecular platform for designing enzyme and redox responsive molecules that target subcellular compartment for functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Selective Protection of Peptides from Proteolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic nanoparticles act as protecting agents for peptides from enzymatic action, enabling selective proteolysis of peptides in a mixture and selective hydrolysis at degenerate cleavage sites.







Abstract
Proteolysis of proteins and peptides is involved in the infection of cells by enveloped viruses and also in the invasion and spread of cancer cells. Shutting down broad&#8208;specificity proteases, however, is problematic because normal functions by these proteases will be affected. Herein, nanoparticle receptors were prepared from molecular imprinting for complex biological peptides. Their strong and selective binding enabled them to protect their targeted sequences from proteolysis in aqueous solution at stoichiometric amounts. Generality of the method was demonstrated by the protection of hydrophobic and hydrophilic peptides from different proteases, selective protection of a segment of a long peptide, and selective protection of a targeted peptide in a mixture. Most interestingly, two receptors targeting different parts of a long peptide could work in cooperation to protect the overall sequence, highlighting the versatility of the method.

         <title>One&#8208;step Ethylene Purification from an Acetylene/Ethylene/Ethane Ternary Mixture by Cyclopentadiene Cobalt&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new modification method for metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can realize one&#8208;step purification of ethylene in ternary gas mixture with a single adsorbent. 







Abstract
The separation of ethylene (C2H4) from a mixture of ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4), and acetylene (C2H2) at normal temperature and pressure is a significant challenge. The sieving effect of pores is powerless due to the similar molecular size and kinetic diameter of these molecules. We report a new modification method based on a stable ftw topological Zr&#8208;MOF platform (MOF&#8208;525). Introduction of a cyclopentadiene cobalt functional group led to new ftw&#8208;type MOFs materials (UPC&#8208;612 and UPC&#8208;613), which increase the host&#8208;guest interaction and achieve efficient ethylene purification from the mixture of hydrocarbon gases. The high performance of UPC&#8208;612 and UPC&#8208;613 for C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 separation has been verified by gas sorption isotherms, density functional theory (DFT), and experimentally determined breakthrough curves. This work provides a one&#8208;step separation of the ternary gas mixture and can further serve as a blueprint for the design and construction of function&#8208;oriented porous structures for such applications.

         <title>A Balance Between Capture and Release: How Nanochaperones Regulate Refolding of Thermally Denatured Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two working mechanisms of nanochaperones in regulating the refolding of thermally denatured lysozyme were fully deciphered. The balance between the capture and release of client proteins that are controlled by nanochaperones plays a key role in regulating the refolding of denatured proteins, regardless of the ATP&#8208;independent or ATP&#8208;dependent chaperones.







Abstract
Nanochaperones have been designed and used for regulating the (re)folding of proteins, treating protein misfolding&#8208;related diseases, and, more recently, in drug delivery. Despite various successes, a complete understanding of the working mechanisms remains elusive, which represents a challenge for the realization of their full potential. Here, we thoroughly investigated the functioning of differently charged nanochaperones that regulate the refolding of thermally denatured lysozyme. We found that the balance between the capture and release of lysozyme clients that are controlled by nanochaperones plays a key role in regulating refolding. More importantly, the findings could be applied to other enzymes with various physicochemical properties. On the basis of these results, we could recover the activity of enzymes with high efficiency either after 20&#8197;days of storage at 40&#8201;&#176;C or heating at high temperatures for 30&#8211;60&#8197;min. Our results provide important new design strategies for nanochaperone systems to improve their properties and expand their applications.

         <title>Unprecedented 2D Homochiral Hybrid Lead&#8208;Iodide Perovskite Thermochromic Ferroelectrics with Ferroelastic Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D homochiral lead&#8208;iodide perovskites were constructed by the introduction of a chiral center. The perovskites exhibit coexisting ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and reversible thermochromism, offering great application prospects for next&#8208;generation smart devices.







Abstract
Chiral perovskites have emerged as a significant class of materials showing promising optoelectronic and spintronic applications. Reports of chiral perovskite ferroelectrics, however, have been scarce. In this work, we have successfully synthesized homochiral lead&#8211;iodide perovskite ferroelectrics [(R)&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminium]PbI4 and [(S)&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminium]PbI4 by introducing a methyl group into the organic cation of the parent (N&#8208;benzylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminium)PbI4. Vibrational circular dichroism spectra identify the chiral mirroring relationship. They both undergo 222F2&#8208;type paraelectric&#8211;ferroelectric behavior at around 378&#8197;K coupled with clear ferroelastic domain &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; switching. Besides, they exhibit an evident thermochromism with color change from orange&#8211;yellow to orange&#8211;red. To our knowledge, the discovery of integrated ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and reversible thermochromism in chiral perovskites is unprecedented.

         <title>Implantable Biosupercapacitor Inspired by the Cellular Redox System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study describes an implantable supercapacitor using NAD+, which is a key redox biomolecule responsible for cellular energy transduction.







Abstract
The carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn supercapacitor has high potential for in vivo energy storage because it can be used in aqueous environments and stitched to inner parts of the body, such as blood vessels. The biocompatibility issue for frequently used pseudocapacitive materials, such as metal oxides, is controversial in the human body. Here, we report an implantable CNT yarn supercapacitor inspired by the cellular redox system. In all living cells, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a key redox biomolecule responsible for cellular energy transduction to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Based on this redox system, CNT yarn electrodes were fabricated by inserting a twist in CNT sheets with electrochemically deposited NAD and benzoquinone for redox shuttling. Consequently, the NAD/BQ/CNT yarn electrodes exhibited the maximum area capacitance (55.73&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) under physiological conditions, such as phosphate&#8208;buffered saline and serum. In addition, the yarn electrodes showed a negligible loss of capacitance after 10&#8201;000 repeated charge/discharge cycles and deformation tests (bending/knotting). More importantly, NAD/BQ/CNT yarn electrodes implanted into the abdominal cavity of a rat's skin exhibited the stable in vivo electrical performance of a supercapacitor. Therefore, these findings demonstrate a redox biomolecule&#8208;applied platform for implantable energy storage devices.

         <title>Rotaxanes as Cages to Control DNA Binding, Cytotoxicity, and Cellular Uptake of a Small Molecule**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of many drugs can be limited by undesirable properties including low bioavailability and &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; interactions. Herein we demonstrate the potential for using mechanical protection to &#8220;cage&#8221; a DNA&#8208;targeting metallodrug within a photodegradable rotaxane, leading to enhanced cell permeability and limited cytotoxicity in cancer cells compared to the &#8220;uncaged&#8221; metallodrug. Light activation leads to a dramatic increase in cytotoxicity and translocation to the cell nucleus.







Abstract
The efficacy of many drugs can be limited by undesirable properties, such as poor aqueous solubility, low bioavailability, and &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; interactions. To combat this, various drug carriers have been investigated to enhance the pharmacological profile of therapeutic agents. In this work, we demonstrate the use of mechanical protection to &#8220;cage&#8221; a DNA&#8208;targeting metallodrug within a photodegradable rotaxane. More specifically, we report the synthesis of rotaxanes incorporating as a stoppering unit a known G&#8208;quadruplex DNA binder, namely a PtII&#8208;salphen complex. This compound cannot interact with DNA when it is part of the mechanically interlocked assembly. The second rotaxane stopper can be cleaved by either light or an esterase, releasing the PtII&#8208;salphen complex. This system shows enhanced cell permeability and limited cytotoxicity within osteosarcoma cells compared to the free drug. Light activation leads to a dramatic increase in cytotoxicity, arising from the translocation of PtII&#8208;salphen to the nucleus and its binding to DNA.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Activity of 3d&#8208;Block Metal (Hydro)oxides by Ligand&#8208;Induced Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general ligand&#8208;induced conversion strategy was proposed to boost the electrocatalytic activities of 3d&#8208;block metal (hydro)oxides. After the introduction of an organic ligand, the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) increased by &#8776;5.7 times.







Abstract
The 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal (hydro)oxides belong to a group of highly efficient, scalable and inexpensive electrocatalysts for widespread energy&#8208;related applications that feature easily tailorable crystal and electronic structures. We propose a general strategy to further boost their electrocatalytic activities by introducing organic ligands into the framework, considering that most 3d&#8208;metal (hydro)oxides usually exhibit quite strong binding with reaction intermediates and thus compromised activity due to the scaling relations. Involving weakly bonded ligands downshifts the d&#8208;band center, which narrows the band gap, and optimizes the adsorption of these intermediates. For example, the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be greatly promoted by &#8776;5.7 times over a NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) after a terephthalic acid (TPA)&#8208;induced conversion process, arising from the reduced energy barrier of the deprotonation of OH* to O*. Impressively, the proposed ligand&#8208;induced conversion strategy is applicable to a series of 3d&#8208;block metal (hydro)oxides, including NiFe2O4, NiCo2O4, and NiZn LDH, providing a general structural upgrading scheme for existing high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic systems.

         <title>Rhodium Catalyzed Regioselective C&#8722;H Allylation of Simple Arenes via C&#8722;C Bond Activation of Gem&#8208;difluorinated Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium catalyzed C(aryl)&#8722;C(allyl) bond&#8208;forming reaction is achieved via a combination of C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C activation. Gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes can be employed as highly reactive allyl surrogates, enabling C&#8722;H allylation of a variety of simple arenes under mild conditions.







Abstract
Herein, we report a rhodium catalyzed directing&#8208;group free regioselective C&#8722;H allylation of simple arenes. Readily available gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes can be employed as highly reactive allyl surrogates via a sequence of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;F bond activation, providing allyl arene derivatives in good yields with high regioselectivity under mild conditions. The robust methodology enables facile late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules. The high efficiency of this reaction is also demonstrated by the high turnover number (TON, up to 1700) of the rhodium catalyst on gram&#8208;scale experiments. Preliminary success on kinetic resolution of this transformation is achieved, providing a promising access to enantio&#8208;enriched gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes.

Preliminary success on kinetic resolution of this transformation is achieved, providing a promising access to enantio&#8208;enriched &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>(&#8722;)&#8208;Isoscopariusin&#8197;A, a Naturally Occurring Immunosuppressive Meroditerpenoid: Structure Elucidation and Scalable Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the isolation, structure determination of (&#8722;)&#8208;isoscopariusin&#8197;A by spectroscopic analysis and concise chemical synthesis. The unprecedented meroditerpenoid bears a 6/6/4 tricyclic carbon skeleton with seven continuous stereocenters, and exhibits selective inhibition of T&#8208;cell proliferation. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis was achieved in 12 steps from (+)&#8208;sclareolide.







Abstract
(&#8722;)&#8208;Isoscopariusin&#8197;A was isolated from the aerial parts of Isodon scoparius. Chemical synthesis and spectroscopic analysis established its structure as an unsymmetrical meroditerpenoid bearing a sterically congested 6/6/4 tricyclic carbon skeleton with seven continuous stereocenters. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis was achieved in 12 steps from commercially available (+)&#8208;sclareolide. A cobalt catalyzed, hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;based olefin isomerization was used to prepare a trisubstituted alkene, which underwent stereoselective [2+2] cycloaddition with a substituted keteniminium ion generated in situ from the corresponding amide. The cyclobutanone product was further elaborated into the fully substituted cyclobutane core through face&#8208;selective homologation, and the two side chains were installed by using nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and carbodiimide&#8208;mediated esterification, respectively. (&#8722;)&#8208;Isoscopariusin&#8197;A displayed selective inhibition of T&#8208;cell proliferation.

         <title>A Protein&#8208;Binding Molecular Photothermal Agent for Tumor Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal therapy usually requires a high power density to activate photothermal agent for effective treatment, which inevitably leads to damage to normal tissues and inflammation in tumor tissues. Herein, we rationally design a protein&#8208;binding strategy to build a molecular photothermal agent for photothermal ablation of tumor. The synthesized photothermal agent can covalently bind to the thiol groups on the intracellular proteins. The heat generated by the photothermal agent directly destroyed the bioactive proteins in the cells, effectively reducing the heat loss and the molecular leakage. Under a low power density of 0.2 W/cm2, the temperature produced by the photothermal agent was sufficient to induce apoptosis. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the therapeutic effect of photothermal therapy can be efficiently improved with the protein&#8208;binding strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>NORD: NO Relaxation Delay NMR spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The novel concept of  NORD  (  NO R  elaxation  D  elay) NMR spectroscopy is introduced. The idea is to design concatenated experiments in a way that the magnetization used in the first relaxes toward equilibrium during the second and vice versa, thus saving instrument time. Applications include complete well&#8208;resolved  1  H&#8208;  1  H and  1  H&#8208;  13  C one&#8208;bond and long&#8208;range correlation maps of an 80 mM solution of a trisaccharide recorded in less than two minutes and hydrocortisone with extensive spectral overlap.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Benzyl Alcohols via Palladium/Chiral Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a highly enantioselective kinetic resolution of tertiary benzyl alcohols via palladium/chiral norbornene cooperative catalysis. With simple aryl iodides as the resolution reagent, a wide range of readily available racemic tertiary benzyl alcohols are applicable to this method. Both chiral tertiary benzyl alcohols and benzo[c]chromene products are obtained in good to excellent enantioselectivities (selectivity factor up to 544). The appealing synthetic utility of the obtained enantioenriched tertiary alcohols is demonstrated by the facile preparation of several valuable chiral heterocycles. Preliminary mechanism studies include DFT calculations to explain the origin of enantiodiscrimination and control experiments to uncover the formation of a transient axial chirality during the kinetic resolution step.</dc:description>
