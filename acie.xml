         <title>Deciphering and Enhancing Rate&#8208;Determining Step of Sodium Deposition towards Ultralow&#8208;Temperature Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high ionic conductivity and stable performance at low temperatures remains a significant challenge in sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs). In this study, we propose a novel electrolyte design strategy that elucidates the solvation structure&#8208;function relationship within mixed solvent systems. A mixture of diglyme and 1,3&#8208;dioxolane was developed to optimize the solvation structure towards superior low&#8208;temperature electrolyte. Molecular dynamics simulations and Raman spectra results reveal the solvent&#8208;separated ion pairs and contact ion pairs dominated solvation structure in the designed electrolyte, displaying a superior ionic conductivity of 1.78&#215;10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1 at &#8208;40 &#176;C. Besides, comprehensive kinetic analysis shows Na+ transportation in the electrolyte shows a greater impact on sodium plating than Na+ transport through the solid electrolyte interphase or charge transfer. As a result, the electrolyte enables stable operation for over 12,000 hours in Na||Na cells at &#8208;40 &#176;C. In Na||Na2/3Ni1/4Cu1/12Mn2/3O2 full cells, it maintains a high capacity retention of 92.4% over 600 cycles with an initial specific capacity of 89.4 mAh g&#8208;1 at &#8208;40 &#176;C, and achieves 81.7% capacity retention after 50 cycles with an initial specific capacity of 75.3 mAh g&#8208;1 at &#8208;78 &#176;C. These results pave the way for the development of high&#8208;performance SMBs capable of operating under ultralow temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Pressure on Metavalent Bonding in BiTe influencing Electronic Topological Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BiTe, a member of the (Bi2)m(Bi2Te3)n homologous series, possesses natural van der Waals&#8208;like heterostructure with a Bi2 bilayer sandwiched between the two [Te&#8208;Bi&#8208;Te&#8208;Bi&#8208;Te] quintuple layers. BiTe exhibits both the quantum states of weak topological and topological crystalline insulators, making it a dual topological insulator and a suitable candidate for spintronics, quantum computing and thermoelectrics. Herein, we demonstrate that the chemical bonding in BiTe is to be metavalent, which plays a significant role in the pressure dependent change in the topology of the electronic structure Fermi surface. The enhancement of the metavalent bonding character with pressure in BiTe is evidenced from first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Due to the change in the Fermi surface topology, we have visualized electronic topological transitions (ETT) at 1 and 3 GPa through pressure dependent synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and Raman spectroscopy. The correlation between the metavalent bonding and ETT offers insights into chemical bonding influenced transitions in quantum materials.</dc:description>

         <title>From Natural Product Derivative to Hexagonal Prism Supermolecule: Potent Biofilm Disintegration, Enhanced Foliar Affinity, and Effective Management of Tomato Bacterial Canker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clavibacter michiganensis (Cmm), designated as an A2 quarantine pest by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO), incites bacterial canker of tomato, which presently eludes rapid and effective control methodologies. Dense biofilms formed by Cmm shield internal bacteria from host immune defenses and obstruct the ingress of agrochemicals. Even when agrochemicals disintegrate biofilms, splashing and bouncing during application disperse active ingredients away from target sites. Herein, we present a supramolecular strategy to fabricate a hexagonal prism&#8208;shaped material, BPGA@CB[8], assembled from an 18&#946;&#8208;glycyrrhetinic acid derivative (PBGA) and host molecule&#8212;cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) via host&#8208;guest recognition. This positively charged material manifests multifaceted functionalities, notably the ability to surmount biofilm barriers, annihilate the encased pathogenic bacteria, and enhance foliar affinity of droplets. The strong in vitro potency and effective deposition of BPGA@CB[8] foster optimal conditions for robust in vivo efficacy, demonstrating superior protective and curative activities (56.9%/53.4%) against canker of tomato at a low&#8208;dose of 100 &#956;g&#183;mL&#8208;&#185; compared to BPGA (44.6%/42.2%), kasugamycin (30.1%/28.4%), and thiodiazole copper (35.4%/31.0%). This supramolecular material, based on natural product derivatives, provides a potent treatment for high&#8208;risk canker of tomato, and exemplifies the utility of supramolecular strategies in optimizing the attributes of natural products for managing plant bacterial diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Metal Nanobiohybrids for High&#8208;Performance Solar&#8208;Driven Methanogenesis via Multi&#8208;Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanobiohybrids for solar&#8208;driven methanogenesis present a promising solution to the global energy crisis. However, conventional semiconductor&#8208;based nanobiohybrids face challenges such as limited tunability and poor biocompatibility, leading to undesirable spontaneous electron and proton transfer that compromise their structural stability and CH4 selectivity. Herein, we introduced eutectic gallium&#8211;indium alloys (EGaIn), featuring a self&#8208;limiting surface oxide layer surrounding the liquid metal core after sonication, integrated with Methanosarcina barkeri (M. b). The well&#8208;designed M. b&#8211;EGaIn nanobiohybrids exhibited superior performance, achieving a maximum CH4 yield of 455.64 &#177; 15.99 &#956;mol g&#8722;1, long&#8208;term stability across four successive 7&#8208;day cycles, and remarkable CH4 selectivity of &gt;99%. These improvements stem from enhanced proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer involving hydrogen atoms at the core&#8211;shell interface, further facilitated by the elevated expression of hydrogenases at the abiotic&#8211;biotic interface. This study provides an insightful concept for nanobiohybrid design through multi&#8208;interface engineering, advancing sustainable and scalable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;biofuel conversion under ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Charge Distribution at Organic&#8208;inorganic Interface via Optimizing Substituents for Sustainable Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The space charge effect induced by high&#8208;quality heterojunctions is essential for efficient electrocatalytic processes. Herein, we delicately manipulate intermolecular charge transfer by modifying substituents (&#8208;g = &#8208;CH3, &#8208;H, &#8208;NO2) with various electron donating/withdrawing capabilities in CoPc&#8208;g/CoS organic&#8208;inorganic heterostructures. CoPc&#8208;CH3, as a typical electron donor, transfers more electrons to CoS due to the presence of &#8208;CH3, forming the strongest space electric field and thus regulating the dual active sites at the interface. Furthermore, oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates preferentially adsorb on the positively charged CoPc&#8208;CH3 side, and the rapid accumulation of electrons on the CoS side decelerates catalyst dissolution at the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential, ensuring the stable OER process under the optimized adsorbate evolution mechanism. As a result, CoPc&#8208;CH3/CoS catalyst exhibits the lowest overpotential and remains stable for 150 h at 0.5 A cm&#8208;2 in the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. The method provides a novel strategy for accurately regulating the space electric field of heterojunctions.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoconfinement&#8208;Enabled Resistance to Water Matrix Components for Selective Degradation of Micropollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite recent substantial advances in water treatment, the ability to selectively degrade trace micropollutants in real waters with complex matrix components remains a grand challenge. Here we report rational crafting of graphene oxide (GO)&#8208;wrapped defective TiO2 composite catalysts that creates nanoscopic confinement over the TiO2 surface within GO, thereby enabling the selective degradation of micropollutants through effectively excluding natural organic matter (NOM) and anions from the nanoconfined catalytic sites. In contrast to unconfined counterparts, the nanoconfined composite catalysts retain high degradation efficiency when exposed to various concentrations of NOM and anions, even in real water samples. Oxygen vacancies in TiO2 promote electron separation and oxygen adsorption, leading to a 4.9&#8208;fold increase in hydroxyl radical concentration within the nanoconfined space compared to the bulk solution. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy unveil the nanoconfined catalytic sites on the TiO2 surface, where micropollutants smaller than the pores of GO are effectively degraded, while NOM with a larger size is excluded by GO.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite recent substantial advances in water treatment, the ability to selectively degrade trace micropollutants in real waters with complex matrix components remains a grand challenge. Here we report rational crafting of graphene oxide (GO)-wrapped defective TiO2 composite catalysts that creates nanoscopic confinement over the TiO2 surface within GO, thereby enabling the selective degradation of micropollutants through effectively excluding natural organic matter (NOM) and anions from the nanoconfined catalytic sites. In contrast to unconfined counterparts, the nanoconfined composite catalysts retain high degradation efficiency when exposed to various concentrations of NOM and anions, even in real water samples. Oxygen vacancies in TiO2 promote electron separation and oxygen adsorption, leading to a 4.9-fold increase in hydroxyl radical concentration within the nanoconfined space compared to the bulk solution. In-situ X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy unveil the nanoconfined catalytic sites on the TiO2 surface, where micropollutants smaller than the pores of GO are effectively degraded, while NOM with a larger size is excluded by GO. Furthermore, the formation of toxic disinfection byproducts is well controlled due to the exclusion of NOM. This work provides a simple yet viable strategy for designing 2D material-wrapped catalysts to selectively degrade target micropollutants in complex real waters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand engineering regulation toward Zn ions and Zn substrate for all&#8208;climate&#160;Zn&#160;metal&#160;batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of artificial interphase for advanced Zn anode is an effective solution to achieve superior electrochemical performance for aqueous batteries. However, the deployment of atomically precise architectures and ligand engineering to achieve functionalization&#8208;oriented regulatory screening is lacking, which is hindered by higher requirements for synthetic chemistry and structural chemistry. Herein, we have first performed ligand engineering which selected zinc ion trapping ligands (&#8211;CH3) based on the coordination effect, and zinc substrate binding ligands (&#8211;N=N&#8208;xC6H5) based on the electrostatic interaction. Correspondingly, octa nuclear Zn(II)&#8208;Siloxane&#8208;PhPz/BiPhPz/TriPhPz Cluster (OZSPC/OZSBPC/OZSTPC) are accurately synthesized, and OZSBPC is verified to serve as the most suitable artificial interphase via balancing the interactions with both Zn2+ and Zn substrate (&#8220;Zn&#8208;Zn effect&#8221;). Consequently, at &#8211;30 &#176;C, the assembled OZSBPC&#8208;Zn symmetric cells run for 3000 h and the assembled full cells with OZSBPC&#8208;Zn anode could be stable for 10,000 cycles. The pouch cells using OZSBPC&#8208;Zn anode deliver a reversible capacity of ~1.2 Ah and the energy density of 41 Wh kgtotal&#8722;1 with excellent cycling performance. The successful structural design of OZSBPC explores a novel well&#8208;defined structural design concept as one criterion for artificial interface as well as motivates batteries systems to meet the requirements of industrialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroglycosylation of Alkynes for the Synthesis of Vinyl &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroglycosylation of terminal alkynes, employing bench&#8208;stable&#160;ortho&#8208;iodobiphenyl (oIB) substituted sulfides as glycosyl donors. This reaction occurs with high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity to afford&#160;E&#8208;configured vinyl &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides, a class of compounds nontrivial to access by previous methods. The use of a bis(oxazoline) ligand with bulky side chains is critical for the high selectivities observed. Aryl iodides have not been used previously as surrogates for alkyl (glycosyl) electrophiles in Co&#8208;H catalyzed reactions. The transformation features mild reaction conditions, simple reagents, and broad substrate scope. This method can be applied to the derivatization of bioactive compounds and the preparation of naturally occurring products. Mechanistic studies suggest this stereoconvergent process involves glycosyl radicals as key reaction intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Upcycling polynorbornene derivatives into chemically recyclable multiblock linear and thermoset plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic polymers have found widespread use with functional lifetimes from seconds to decades. However, the lack of end&#8208;of&#8208;life treatment for these plastics is causing a significant environmental and human health crisis due to their persistence and bioaccumulation. Upcycling post&#8208;consumer plastic waste to products with inherent recyclability is an attractive strategy to tackle this problem, as it can broaden the range of accessible materials and uncover unprecedented features while dealing with current plastic waste. Here, we demonstrate the upcycling of polynorbornene derivatives (pNBEs) including polydicyclopentadiene (pDCPD) thermosets through their transformation into distinct oligomeric buildings blocks which can be repolymerized into chemically recyclable pNBEs&#8208;like multiblock linear and crosslinked plastics. These materials exhibit a diverse set of mechanical properties, while integrate a high melting transition temperature with a broad range of glass transition temperature, controlled by the feed ratio of building blocks. After use, upcycled plastics could be effectively deconstructed back to the oligomers for recovery and repolymerization. Overall, this work establishes an approach that can be utilized to upcycle pNBEs and pDCPD into previously inaccessible multiblock thermoset and thermoplastics with full recyclability, and may be generalizable to a range of polymers to shift their end&#8208;of&#8208;life waste disposal toward sustainable recovery and reuse.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency (21.4%) Carbon Perovskite Solar Cells via Cathode Interface Engineering by using CuPc Hole&#8208;Transporting Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) represent a promising photovoltaic technology that addresses the long&#8208;term operating stability needed to compete with commercial Si solar cells. However, the poor interface contacts between the carbon electrode and the perovskite result in a gap between C&#8208;PSC's performances and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PSCs based on metallic back electrodes. In this work, Cu (II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) was rediscovered as an effective hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM) to be coupled with carbon electrodes. In particular, based on computional studies and VASP calculations, it is found that the tetragonal structure of CuPc could efficiently coordinated to perovskite layer via N and Cu atoms to Pb and I atoms, respectively. By systematically optimizing the concentration of the CuPc HTL solution, and screening the coupling of CuPc HTL with two types of carbon electrodes, based on carbon black:graphite mixture and reduced graphene oxide, respectively, a maximum power conversion efficiency of 21.4% has been achieved. In addition, our cells demonstrate satisfactory stability under thermal ageing at 85&#176;C; 20% PCE loss after more than 200 h and shelf&#8208;life ageing 20 days with 1.3% PCE loss in ambient conditions (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1). These findings are interesting in developing commercially competitive C&#8208;PSCs, as they combine both high PCE and stability.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunotherapy is a promising cancer treatment, but its application is hindered by tumors&#8217; low immunogenicity and the difficulty of immune cell infiltration. Here, to address above issues and achieve targeted tumor treatment, we designed the first activated small molecule photosensitizer immune&#8208;prodrug HDIM based on pyroptosis, and proposed a self&#8208;amplified immune therapy strategy (SITS) for enhanced tumor therapy. HDIMcan be specifically activated by the tumor hypoxiaand then simultaneously initiate immuno&#8208;therapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8208;induced pyroptosis with NIR laser irradiation. Mechanism study demonstrated that the immunogenicity in tumor can be significantly enhanced by HDIM&#8208;induced pyroptosis and immune cells are recruited, thus effectively amplifying the therapeutic effect of the released immune drugs. As proof of application, we have utilized HDIM for primary tumor and distant tumor therapy. And the experiment results showed that compared to current monotherapy as well as simple combination therapy, the photosensitizer prodrug HDIM exhibited much superior tumor treatment effect owing to its synchronous activation of pyroptosis and immuno&#8208;therapy in tumor.</dc:description>

         <title>t2&#160;Occupancy as an Effective and Predictive Descriptor for the Design of High&#8208;Performance Spinel Oxide Peroxidase&#8208;like Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes are next generation of enzyme mimics. Due to the lack of activity descriptors, most nanozymes were discovered through trial&#8208;and&#8208;error strategies or by accident. While eg occupancy in an octahedral crystal field was proven as an effective descriptor, the t2&#160;in a tetrahedral crystal field has rarely been explored. Here, we first identified t2&#160;occupancy as an effective and predictive descriptor. Then, we predicted and demonstrated that spinel oxide nanozymes (AB2O4) with a t2&#160;occupancy of around 4.4 at A site had the highest activity. Furthermore, we introduced O&#946; content as a secondary descriptor. The dual descriptor strategy resulted in a three&#8208;dimensional volcanic curve, converging at a vertex. To surpass the limitations of volcanic curves, a dual site optimizing strategy was proposed, guiding the optimization of both A and B sites as Cu and Co, respectively. The designed CuCo2O4 exhibited the highest activity, achieving around 100&#8208; and 2&#8208;fold enhancement compared to initial material and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spinel oxide nanozyme LiCo2O4, respectively. Density functional theory calculations provided a theoretical basis for the catalytic process. This work provides a new strategy for the rational design of nanozymes, and t2&#160;occupancy may also be applicable to the design of other catalysts.</dc:description>

Here, we first identified t2&#160;occupancy as an effective and predictive descriptor. Then, we predicted and demonstrated that spinel oxide nanozymes (AB2O4) with a t2&#160;occupancy of around 4.4 at A site had the highest activity. Furthermore, we introduced O&#946; content as a secondary descriptor. The dual descriptor strategy resulted in a three-dimensional volcanic curve, converging at a vertex. To surpass the limitations of volcanic curves, a dual site optimizing strategy was proposed, guiding the optimization of both A and B sites as Cu and Co, respectively. The designed CuCo2O4 exhibited the highest activity, achieving around 100- and 2-fold enhancement compared to initial material and the state-of-the-art spinel oxide nanozyme LiCo2O4, respectively. Density functional theory calculations provided a theoretical basis for the catalytic process. This work provides a new strategy for the rational design of nanozymes, and t2&#160;occupancy may also be applicable to the design of other catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multivariate Approaches Boosting Lithium&#8208;Mediated Ammonia Electrosynthesis in Different Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia electrosynthesis through the lithium&#8208;mediated approach has recently reached promising results towards high activity and selectivity in aprotic media, reaching high Faradaic efficiency (FE) values and NH3 production rates. To fasten the comprehension and optimization of the complex lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction system, for the first time a multivariate approach is proposed as a powerful tool to reduce the number of experiments in comparison with the classical one&#8208;factor&#8208;at&#8208;a&#8208;time approach. Doehlert design and surface response methodology are employed to optimize the electrolyte composition for a batch autoclaved cell. The method is validated with the common LiBF4 salt, and the correlations between the FE and the amount of lithium salt and ethanol as proton donor are elucidated, also discussing their impact on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Moreover, a new fluorinated salt is proposed (i.e., lithium difluoro(oxalate) borate (LiFOB)), taking inspiration from lithium batteries. This salt is chosen to tailor the SEI layer, with the aim of obtaining a bifunctional interfacial layer, both stable and permeable to N2, the latter being an essential characteristic for batch systems. The SEI layer composition is confirmed strategic and its tailoring with LiFOB boosts FE values.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Despite the remarkable advancements in hypervalent iodine chemistry, exploration of bromine and chlorine analogues remains in its infancy due to their difficult synthesis. Herein, we introduce six&#8208;membered cyclic &#955;3&#8208;bromanes and &#955;3&#8208;chloranes. Through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analyses and conformational studies, we delineate the crucial bonding patterns pivotal for the thermodynamic stability of these compounds. Notably, these investigations reveal pronounced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking phenomena within the crystal lattice of hypercoordinated bromine(III) and chlorine(III) species. Their reactivity profile is explored as they are radical precursors or electrophilic reagents in metal&#8208;free intermolecular biaryl couplings, O&#8208; and S&#8208;arylations, and Cu(I)&#8208;promoted intramolecular biaryl couplings which is complementary to the known reactivity of five&#8208;membered bromanes and chloranes. Mechanistic insights are provided, elucidating the pathways governing their reactivity and underscoring the potential in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategic Nitrogen Site Alignment in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Performance in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodide Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (AZIBs) are gaining attention as next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical capacity, enhanced safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, their practical application is hindered by challenges such as slow reaction kinetics and the persistent polyiodide shuttle effect. To address these limitations, we developed a novel class of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) featuring electron&#8208;rich nitrogen sites with varied density and distribution (N1&#8208;N4) along the pore walls. These nitrogen sites enhance iodine species confinement and mass transport. Our experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the continuous and optimized distribution of nitrogen sites within the COF structure significantly reduces internal resistance and boosts redox activity. Moreover, the N4&#8208;COF demonstrates superior performance compared to other porous materials, due to its high density and strategic alignment of active sites. The I2@N4&#8208;COF cathode achieves a remarkable specific capacity of 348 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 1 C, almost 1.8 times greater than that of the I2@N1&#8208;COF, while also maintaining excellent cycling stability. This integration of a porous framework with aligned nitrogen sites in the N4&#8208;COF structure not only enhances iodine redox behavior but also offers a promising design strategy for developing high&#8208;performance AZIB electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Amide&#8208;Directed Highly Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Diverse Acyclic Multisubstituted Alkenes Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed amide&#8208;directed highly enantioselective hydrogenation of acyclic multisubstituted alkenes has been developed. This general catalyst enables enantioselective hydrogenation of a diverse range of alkenes containing 3&#8211;4 alkyl substituents under mild conditions, delivering compounds with contiguous tertiary chiral centers in high yields with &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and up to 99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Enantioselective hydrogenation of tetrasubstituted alkenes to form 1,2&#8208;contiguous stereocenters is a particularly appealing but highly challenging transformation in asymmetric catalysis. Despite the notable progress achieved in enantioselective hydrogenation over the past decades, enantioselective hydrogenation of all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes containing multiple alkyl groups remains an unsolved challenge. Here, we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of diverse acyclic multisubstituted alkenes under mild conditions. The coordination assistance of the amide group to the metal center generates a highly active catalyst that effectively overcomes the low reactivity of substrates and precisely controls the stereoselectivity. The generality of this catalyst system is exemplified by its efficacy across at least three types of alkenes including &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated amides, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides, and enamides.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Driven Ammonia Synthesis via a Proton&#8208;Mediated Photoelectrochemical Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of photo&#8208;driven N2 reduction to NH3 via a proton&#8208;mediated photoelecrochemical device is proposed and achieved. This strategy with a two&#8208;electrode cell system uses a covalent organic framework (COF) anode with Au single&#8208;atom catalytic sites and &#8722;OH redox functions, which enables protons to be stored and transferred to catalytic sites. It achieved proton promoted N2 reduction reaction and the ammonia synthesis.







Abstract
N2 reduction reaction (NRR) by light is an energy&#8208;saving and sustainable ammonia (NH3) synthesis technology. However, it faces significant challenges, including high energy barriers of N2 activation and unclear catalytic active sites. Herein, we propose a strategy of photo&#8208;driven ammonia synthesis via a proton&#8208;mediated photoelectrochemical device. We used redox&#8208;catalysis covalent organic framework (COF), with a redox site (&#8722;C=O) for H+ reversible storage and a catalytic site (porphyrin Au) for NRR. In the proton&#8208;mediated photoelectrochemical device, the COF can successfully store e&#8722; and H+ generated by hydrogen oxidation reaction, forming COF&#8722;H. Then, these stored e&#8722; and H+ can be used for photo&#8208;driven NRR (108.97&#8197;umol&#8201;g&#8722;1) under low proton concentration promoted by the H&#8208;bond network formed between &#8722;OH in COF&#8722;H and N2 on Au, which enabled N2 hydrogenation and NH3 production, establishing basis for advancing artificial photosynthesis and enhancing ammonia synthesis technology.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;dimensional array superstructures of cubic quantum dots are formed by sandwiching them between unique supramolecular polymer templates composed of organic molecular assemblies. The array superstructures of cubic quantum dots exhibit energy transfer between uniformly arranged quantum dots.







Abstract
Precise control of assembled structures of quantum dots (QDs) is crucial for realizing the desired photophysical properties, but this remains challenging. Especially, the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) control is rare due to the nearly isotropic nature of QDs. Herein, we propose a novel strategy for controlling the 1D&#8208;arrangement range of cubic perovskite QDs in solution based on the morphological modification of a supramolecular polymer (SP) template. The original template with a short and tangled fibrous structure is prepared in a low&#8208;polarity solvent mixture via self&#8208;assembly of a naphthalenediimide&#8208;functionalized cholesterol derivative with an adhesion group for QDs. Mixing this template with QDs leads to the co&#8208;aggregation into short&#8208;range 1D&#8208;arrays of QDs on the templates. Notably, subsequent heating and cooling of the co&#8208;aggregate solution forms longer&#8208;range 1D&#8208;arrays of QDs with lateral growth, where arranged QDs are sandwiched between reconstructed SP templates. Furthermore, the longer&#8208;range 1D&#8208;array of QDs is achieved via an alternative route involving the pre&#8208;organization of templates into longer and dispersed fibers by heating and cooling of the original template, succeeded by co&#8208;assembly with QDs. Finally, we reveal continuous fluorescence resonance energy transfer between 1D&#8208;arranged QDs by an in&#8208;depth analysis of the photoluminescence decay curves.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Octahedral Lanthanide Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient circularly polarized luminescence of lanthanide cages was achieved through amino acid induction, the luminescence asymmetry factor and quantum yield are 0.53 and 61&#8201;%, respectively. The induction ability of amino acid is positively correlated with the number of coordination bonds and coordination bond energies in the precursor formed by amino acid and lanthanide ions.







Abstract
Chiral metal organic cage compounds with excellent circularly polarized luminescent performance have broad application prospects in many fields. Herein, two lanthanide complexes with luminescent properties in the form of racemic hexagonal octahedral cages were synthesized using a tri (&#946;&#8208;diketone) ligand. Eu6(C21H6F15O6)8(H2O)6 exhibited red light emission with high quantum yields of 61&#8201;%. Then, we successfully synthesized lanthanide compounds with circularly polarized luminescent activity by chiral induction of the racemic mixture with arginine. The luminescence asymmetry factor was 0.53, and the circularly polarized luminescent merit figure reached 0.323. High&#8208;performance circularly polarized luminescent of racemic cage like compound systems have achieved using cheap and readily available chiral amino acid molecules through chiral induction.

         <title>Orthogonal&#8208;Group&#8208;Controlled Site&#8208;Selective I&#8208;Branching of Poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine Chains Reveals Unique Binding Specificities of Proteins towards I&#8208;Antigens</title>

         <dc:description>
A highly efficient chemoenzymatic approach was developed to achieve site&#8208;selective I&#8208;branching of poly&#8208;LacNAc chains. The approach relies on three orthogonal protecting groups, each of which &#8220;caps&#8221; one branching site for selective &#8220;decapping&#8221; and GCNT2&#8208;catalyzed I&#8208;branching. A diverse library of 41 linear and branched poly&#8208;LacNAc glycans were prepared from a single precursor. Glycan array analysis then revealed unique recognition of I&#8208;branches.







Abstract
Poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (poly&#8208;LacNAc) is ubiquitously expressed on cell surface glycoconjugates, serving as the backbone of complex glycans and an extended scaffold that presents diverse glycan epitopes. The branching of poly&#8208;LacNAc, where internal galactose (Gal) residues have &#946;1&#8208;6 linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) attached, forms the blood group I&#8208;antigen, which is closely associated with various physiological and pathological processes including cancer progression. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear as many of the I&#8208;antigen sequences are undefined and inaccessible. In this study, we developed a highly efficient orthogonal&#8208;group&#8208;controlled approach to access site&#8208;selectively I&#8208;branched poly&#8208;LacNAc chains. The approach relies on three orthogonal protecting groups, each of them &#8220;caps&#8221; one internal Gal residue of poly&#8208;LacNAc. These groups can be readily &#8220;decapped&#8221; by specific enzymes or chemical reduction to expose desired sites for GCNT2&#8208;catalyzed I&#8208;branching. This approach enabled the rapid preparation of a diverse library of 41 linear and branched poly&#8208;LacNAc glycans from a single precursor. Glycan microarray analysis using these complex glycans revealed unique recognitions of I&#8208;branches by lectins, anti&#8208;I mAbs, and galectins. Surprisingly, oxidized forms of linear poly&#8208;LacNAc strongly bound to several glycan&#8208;binding proteins (GBPs). These findings help to bridge the gap in recognition of I&#8208;branching and open new avenues for therapeutic development by targeting galectins.

         <title>Asymmetric gem&#8208;Hydroboration and gem&#8208;Hydrogenation of Ynamides: A New Gateway to Chiral Fischer Carbene Complexes and their Catalytic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
gem&#8208;Hydrogenation and gem&#8208;hydroboration of alkynes are highly unorthodox transformations, but asymmetric such gem&#8208;addition reactions are unprecedented. They have now been achieved with excellent levels of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity using ynamides carrying an Evans oxazolidinone as the substrates. The resulting pianostool ruthenium carbenes were fully characterized and could even be engaged in catalytic downstream reactions.







Abstract
Ynamides, when reacted with H2 or HBpin in the presence of [Cp*RuCl]4, convert into chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal Fischer carbenes by regioselective gem&#8208;hydrogenation or gem&#8208;hydroboration of the polarized triple bond, respectively. gem&#8208;Hydroboration concomitantly affords a carbogenic borylated stereocenter adjacent to the ruthenium carbene unit, the configuration of which can be controlled using an Evans auxiliary. These are the first examples of asymmetric gem&#8208;addition reactions to alkynes known in the literature; representative pianostool ruthenium carbene complexes formed by this unconventional route were characterized by crystallographic and spectroscopic means. They undergo various stoichiometric reactions and can even entertain catalytic asymmetric transformations, such as hydrogenative cyclopropanations or a novel type of borylative cycloisomerization.

         <title>Topological Insulator Heterojunction with Electric Dipole Domain to Boost Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional potential well&#8208;type Bi2Te3/TiO2 heterojunction is constructed with the superiority of mass transport, polysulfides capture and conversion. These enable a significantly improved electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;S batteries, a high area capacity of 11.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and acceptable cycling stability are realized even with the high sulfur loading of 13.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low E/S ratio of 3.8&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1.







Abstract
The heterojunction materials are considered as promising electrocatalyst candidates that empower advanced lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. However, the detailed functional mechanism of heterojunction materials to boost the sulfur redox reaction kinetics remains unclear. Herein, we construct a multifunctional potential well&#8208;type Bi2Te3/TiO2 topological insulator (TI) heterojunction with electric dipole domain to elucidate the synergistic mechanism, which facilitates rapid mass transport, strengthens polysulfide capture ability and accelerates polysulfide conversion. Therefore, the Li&#8722;S battery with Bi2Te3/TiO2 TI heterojunction modified separator achieves high utilization of sulfur cathode, delivering a high reversible specific capacity of 1375&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C and long cycling capability with a negligible capacity decay of 0.022&#8201;% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1&#8197;C. Even with the high sulfur loading of 13.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low E/S ratio of 3.8&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1, a high area capacity of 11.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and acceptable cycling stability can be obtained. This work provides guidance for designing high&#8208;efficiency TI heterojunctions to promote the practical application of Li&#8722;S batteries.

However, the detailed functional mechanism of heterojunction materials to boost the sulfur redox reaction kinetics remains unclear. Herein, we construct a multifunctional potential well-type Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; topological insulator (TI) heterojunction with electric dipole domain to elucidate the synergistic mechanism, which facilitates rapid mass transport, strengthens polysulfide capture ability and accelerates polysulfide conversion. Therefore, the Li&#8722;S battery with Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; TI heterojunction modified separator achieves high utilization of sulfur cathode, delivering a high reversible specific capacity of 1375&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2&#8197;C and long cycling capability with a negligible capacity decay of 0.022&#8201;% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1&#8197;C. Even with the high sulfur loading of 13.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and low E/S ratio of 3.8&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a high area capacity of 11.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and acceptable cycling stability can be obtained. This work provides guidance for designing high-efficiency TI heterojunctions to promote the practical application of Li&#8722;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovering Cell&#8208;Targeting Ligands and Cell&#8208;Surface Receptors by Selection of DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries against Cancer Cells without Predefined Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unbiased DEL selection method against cancer cells without predefined targets has been developed. Small&#8208;molecule ligands targeting aggressive cancer cells have been identified and applied in targeted delivery applications, including cancer photodynamic therapy and drug delivery. It is shown that DELs can be a useful tool to identify specific surface receptors on cancer cells.







Abstract
Small molecules that can bind to specific cells have broad application in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Screening large chemical libraries against live cells is an effective strategy for discovering cell&#8208;targeting ligands. The DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL or DECL) technology has emerged as a robust tool in drug discovery and has been successfully utilized in identifying ligands for biological targets. However, nearly all DEL selections have predefined targets, while target&#8208;agnostic DEL selections interrogating the entire cell surface remain underexplored. Herein, we systematically optimized a cell&#8208;based DEL selection method against cancer cells without predefined targets. A 104.96&#8208;million&#8208;member DEL was selected against MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells, representing high and low metastatic properties, respectively, which led to the identification of cell&#8208;specific small molecules. We further demonstrated cell&#8208;targeting applications of these ligands in cancer photodynamic therapy and targeted drug delivery. Finally, leveraging the DNA tag of DEL compounds, we identified &#945;&#8208;enolase (ENO1) as the cell surface receptor of one of the ligands targeting the more aggressive MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells. Overall, this work offers an efficient approach for discovering cell&#8208;targeting small molecule ligands by using DELs and demonstrates that DELs can be a useful tool to identify specific surface receptors on cancer cells.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Activated B&#8208;Doping for Efficient 2e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction through Suppressing H2O2 Decomposition at High Overpotential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, boron&#8208;active functional groups are introduced via vacancy activation to effectively tune the adsorption strength of the *OOH intermediate and the H2O2 product. This approach enhances the selectivity of the 2e&#8722; ORR and facilitates the timely desorption of H2O2, preventing its further decomposition on the catalyst surface, thereby enabling efficient H2O2 production under high current density conditions.







Abstract
The production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) has emerged as a more environmentally friendly alternative to the traditional anthraquinone method. Although oxidized carbon catalysts have intensive developed due to their high selectivity and activity, the yield and conversion rate of H2O2 under high overpotential still limited. The produced H2O2 was rapidly consumed by the increased intensity of H2O2 reduction, which could ascribe to decomposition of peroxide radicals under high voltage in the carbon catalyst. To overcome this issue, a B doped carbon have been developed to catalyze 2e&#8722; ORR with high efficient through suppressing H2O2 decomposition at high potential. Thus, thermal reducing of oxygen containing groups (OCGs) on graphite could construct defects and vacancies, which in situ convert to B&#8722;Cx subunits on the edge of graphene sheets. The introduction of B&#8722;Cx effectively prevented the decomposition of the *O&#8722;O bond and provided suitable adsorption capacity for *OOH, achieving excellent selectivity for the 2e&#8722; ORR across a wide voltage range. Finally, a remarkable H2O2 yield of 7.91&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 was delivered at an industrial current density of 600&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which could provide &#8220;green&#8221; pathway for scale&#8208;upable synthesis H2O2.

         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenolysis rearrangement of allylic acetates using (s&#8208;Bu)3BHK has been established, achieving the enantioselective synthesis of non&#8208;atropisomeric axially chiral alkylidene cycloalkanes with excellent chemo and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). This methodology not only offers a powerful tool for the synthesis of these challenging non&#8208;atropisomeric axially chiral olefins structures, which remain vastly underexplored, but also expands the scope and utility of asymmetric hydrogenolysis reactions, highlighting their versatility and effectiveness in synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenolysis rearrangement of allylic acetates using (s&#8208;Bu)3BHK has been described, achieving the synthesis of axially chiral alkylidene cycloalkanes with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and a wide substrate scope (30 examples of cyclohexanes and cyclobutanes). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to achieve synthesis of axially chiral olefins via asymmetric hydrogenolysis of allylic acetates. This methodology not only offers a novel synthetic pathway for non&#8208;atropisomeric axially chiral structures but also highlights the potential of asymmetric hydrogenolysis as a powerful tool in synthetic organic chemistry.

         <title>Delocalized Nonbonding Orbitals of Thioxanthone in Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Reduced Energy Gap and Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen&#8208;containing carbonyl groups have been incorporated into fused organoboron multiple resonance emitters. 2TXBN and BNTXBN exhibit bright orange&#8208;red emissions with maxima at 582 and 585&#8197;nm, respectively, along with narrow full widths at half maximum of 30 and 32&#8197;nm. Furthermore, the nonbonding orbital of 2TXBN delocalizes within the thioxanthone segment, which raises the first triplet energy level and reduces the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap.







Abstract
Chalcogen&#8208;containing carbonyls, specifically thioxanthone (TX), hold great potential in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). While the development of narrowband OLEDs with chalcogen&#8208;containing carbonyls remains challenging due to difficulties in achieving both high device efficiency and narrow emission spectra. Herein, via a strategic incorporation of the TX moiety, two orange&#8208;red narrowband emitters, 2TXBN and BNTXBN, are designed and synthesized for the first time. Both 2TXBN and BNTXBN exhibit bright orange&#8208;red emissions with peaks at 582 and 585&#8197;nm, respectively, along with narrow full widths at half maxima of 30 and 32&#8197;nm. Notably, 2TXBN demonstrates delocalization of the nonbonding orbital within the TX segment, which raises the first triplet energy level and reduces the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. This electronic structural adjustment effectively shortens the delayed fluorescence lifetime, leading to enhanced device performance. Accordingly, OLED employing 2TXBN as the emitter achieves remarkable performance, with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.0&#8201;%, a current efficiency of 69.0&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and a power efficiency of 76.0&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, highlighting the efficacy of the nonbonding orbital delocalization strategy in achieving bathochromic&#8208;shifted narrowband OLED materials.

         <title>Crystal&#8208;Facet Engineering of Mesoporous CuS Cascade Nanoreactors Enhances Photocatalytic C&#8722;C Coupling of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4</title>

         <dc:description>
Hollow mesoporous CuS nanoreactors with anisotropic (100)&#8208;(110) crystal&#8208;facets have been successfully synthesized via an interfacial&#8208;confined ion dynamic migration&#8208;rearrangement strategy. The cascade nanoreactors with spatially separated Au&#8208;(110) and Co&#8208;(100) sites are constructed by utilizing the directional transport of carriers along the (100)&#8208;(110) crystal&#8208;facets, which facilitates the conversion of CO2 to C2H4.







Abstract
Crystal&#8208;facet heterojunction engineering of mesoporous nanoreactors with highly redox&#8208;active represents an efficacious strategy for the transformation of CO2 into valuable C2 products (e.g., C2H4). Herein, hollow mesoporous cube&#8208;like CuS nanoreactors (~860&#8197;nm) with controlled anisotropic crystal&#8208;facets are prepared through an interfacial&#8208;confined ion dynamic migration&#8208;rearrangement strategy. The regulation of the S2&#8722; ion concentration facilitates the modulation of the highly active (110) to (100) crystal&#8208;facet ratios from 0.119 to 0.288, and induces the formation of anisotropic crystal&#8208;facet heterojunctions. The controllable crystal&#8208;facet heterojunctions trigger the directional charge carrier migration, and are accompanied with the formation of tandem S&#8208;defect sites (Cu0&#8208;S1@S3). Both of them promote the efficient electron&#8208;hole pair dissociation and attain asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling. The hollow mesoporous CuS nanoreactors with optimized crystal&#8208;facet ratio of 0.224 (HMe&#8208;CuS&#8208;3) deliver a high selectivity of 72.7&#8201;% for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to acetylene (C2H2). Further constructed Au&#8208;(110) and Co3O4&#8208;(100) spatially separated cascade nanoreactors (SS&#8208;Au@Co3O4&#8208;CuS) achieve CO2&#8208;C2H4 photoreduction, in which the Co&#8208;sites enhance H2O dissociation to provide protons and the protonation of *CO to *COH. The *COH is further captured by Au&#8208;sites to accomplish the asymmetric *CO&#8208;*COH coupling and subsequent protonation, ensuring a high C2H4 generation rate of 4.11&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h with a selectivity as high as 90.6&#8201;%.

         <title>Heteroarchitectural Gas Diffusion Layer Promotes CO2 Reduction Coupled with Biomass Oxidation at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiB2&#8208;Ag&#8208;PTFE heteroarchitectural gas diffusion layer (GDL) is developed for CO2 electrolyzer. Such GDL possesses good conductivity, strong hydrophobicity, high chemical stability, and compatibility with various catalysts and electrolytes. Coupling the CO2 reduction reaction with 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction, Faradaic efficiencies of 49.2&#8201;% for ethylene and 85.4&#8201;% for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid are achieved at 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Achieving high product selectivity at ampere&#8208;level current densities is essential for the industrial application of electrochemical CO2 reduction. However, the operational stability of CO2 electrolyzers at large current density has long been hindered by flooding of gas diffusion layer (GDL). Herein, a new heteroarchitectural GDL is designed to overcome flooding. Such GDL is constructed by sequentially sputtering the conductive silver and titanium boride (TiB2) onto a polytetrafluoroethylene substrate. Assembled with Cu catalyst in a flow cell, a maximum ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 64.7&#8201;% was achieved at a current density of 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 6&#8197;M KOH. Furthermore, the GDL is capable of stable operation for over 40&#8197;hours at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations and in situ experiments demonstrate enhanced intermediates adsorption on the TiB2&#8208;supported Cu surface, thereby reducing the energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling. When coupling the CO2 reduction reaction with 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction, Faradaic efficiencies of 49.2&#8201;% for ethylene and 85.4&#8201;% for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid were achieved at 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides a highly stable GDL for efficient CO2 conversion at ampere&#8208;level current density and paves the way for integrating biomolecules conversion in stack&#8208;level devices.

         <title>Asymmetric Heck Silylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present for the first time a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Heck silylation of unactivated alkenes with hydrosilane to afford the axially chiral alkenes with good yields and 87 to 98&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Heck silylation of unactivated alkenes is an efficient strategy for the synthesis of useful organosilicon compounds. However, extensive efforts have been dedicated to only achieving achiral molecules. Herein, a highly regio&#8208; and enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Heck silylation of unactivated alkenes with hydrosilanes is reported for the first time, providing access to axially chiral alkenes in good to excellent yields with 87&#8211;98&#8201;% ee. Aryl and alkyl groups as well as quaternary carbon centers at the 4&#8208;position of vinylcyclohexane could be well tolerated, featuring good functional group tolerance. The gram&#8208;scale reaction proceeds smoothly under mild conditions even with 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading. A possible mechanism has been proposed, in which enantioselectivity is controlled by alkene insertion. A templating strategy that enhances weak bond interaction is employed to control regioselectivity by modifying the substituents on the ligand and silane.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Chamaecydin and (+)&#8208;Isochamaecydin and their Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular approach for the first catalytic asymmetric total syntheses of (+)&#8208;chamaecydin and (+)&#8208;isochamaecydin and their 1&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;epimers is presented. Our synthesis is highlighted by a metal&#8208;halogen exchange/addition reaction to connect the A&#8722;B ring system with E ring system through a convergent strategy and a Michael/aldol cascade for constructing the central C&#8722;D ring system, allowing for a rapid construction of the pentacyclic framework.







Abstract
A modular approach was developed for the first catalytic asymmetric total syntheses of naturally occurring C30 terpene quinone methides and their non&#8208;natural stereoisomers, which feature the presence of an unprecedented spiro[4.4]nonane&#8208;containing 6&#8211;6&#8211;6&#8208;5&#8211;5&#8211;3 hexacyclic skeleton. Resting on a chiral phosphinamide&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reduction of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione, a concise route for the synthesis of enantioenriched 6&#8211;6 bicyclic fragment was developed. The 6&#8211;6 ring fragment and the five&#8208;membered ring fragment were unified via a metal&#8208;halogen exchange/intermolecular addition reaction. Subsequently, the central 6&#8211;5 bicyclic ring system was constructed through a Michael/aldol cascade. The successful establishment of these strategic transformations allowed for an efficient and rapid construction of spiroannulated 6&#8211;6&#8211;6&#8211;5&#8211;5 pentacarbocyclic core via a convergent manner. Finally, the total syntheses of naturally occurring (+)&#8208;chamaecydin and (+)&#8208;isochamaecydin and their corresponding 1&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;stereoisomers have been achieved divergently by appropriately orchestrating the reaction sequence including isopropyl incorporation, oxidation state adjustment, and carbonyl group&#8208;directed regio&#8208; and stereoselective cyclopropanation at a late stage.

         <title>Cationic Magnetically Active Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon with Record Low Band Gap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extended long polycyclic hydrocarbon incorporating two pyrrole units has been developed. Its cationic species exhibit remarkable electronic and magnetic properties, including a record&#8208;low energy gap for the cationic radical, with an extinction coefficient of 3.8&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 2570&#8197;nm, and unusual symmetry&#8208;broken charge transfer. The dication exhibits high Chichibabin diradical character with separated spin localizations.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have attracted significant interest in material chemistry, particularly if they own extremely low band gaps and magnetic properties. However, challenges remain regarding the synthetic accessibility and energy saturation issues. In this study, we introduce NR&#8208;11, which consists of eleven aromatic rings in its main conjugation and is separately doped with two electron&#8208;rich nitrogen atoms. This unique structure imparts intriguing oxidation characteristics to NR&#8208;11. The cationic radical NR&#8208;11+&#8901; exhibits enhanced stability and demonstrates strong absorption in the range of 1250&#8197;nm to 3000&#8197;nm, peaking at 2570&#8197;nm. As a result, the optical energy gap of NR&#8208;11+&#8901; is one of the lowest reported to date. Additionally, X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis reveals that NR&#8208;11+&#8901; displays unusual symmetry&#8208;broken charge separation. For the dication, variable&#8208;temperature NMR and variable&#8208;temperature EPR studies indicate that NR&#8208;112+ exhibits a high diradical character with a &#9653;ES&#8208;T of approximately &#8722;1&#8197;kcal/mol. Additionally, its spins are polarized at two ends of the PAH. Meanwhile, its strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared II region suggests promise in photoacoustic (PA) conversion applications. This work underscores the significance of cationic species of extended long PAHs, highlighting their exceptional properties and potential applications.

         <title>A Malleable Collagen&#8208;Mimic that Undergoes Moisture&#8208;Induced Hardening for Gluing Hydrophilic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designed tripeptide, which organizes in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner as supramolecular helices in its crystal, undergoes a regiospecific single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization, yielding a malleable and mouldable protein&#8208;mimic. This biocompatible collagen&#8208;mimic undergoes moisture induced hardening and glues both biological specimens and synthetic materials, making it an attractive bioadhesive.







Abstract
A collagen&#8208;inspired helical protein&#8208;mimic has been synthesized via topochemical polymerization of a designed tripeptide monomer. In the monomer crystal, molecules arrange in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner, forming supramolecular helices. The azide and alkyne of adjacent molecules in the supramolecular helix are proximally preorganized in a ready&#8208;to&#8208;react arrangement. On heating, the monomer crystals undergo regiospecific single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization, yielding triazolyl&#8208; polypeptide. Polymerization softens the crystals, making the polymer malleable and mouldable. The polymer grains absorb moisture and form agglomerates through water&#8208;bridged adhesion, which hardens over time. The weight&#8208;bearing capacity of a mould made from this polymer increased by 50&#8208;fold due to moisture&#8208;induced hardening. We have demonstrated that this collagen&#8208;mimic can glue both biological specimens such as wood and bone and synthetic materials such as glass and paper. In vitro studies established the biocompatibility, making it an attractive bioinspired material for potential application as a bioadhesive.

Abstract
The global quest for clean energy and sustainable processes makes advanced membrane extremely attractive for energy&#8208;intensive industrial gas separations. Here, we disclosed a series of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;performance gas separation membranes (PIM&#8208;3D&#8208;TB) from novel network polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIM) that combine the advantages of solution processible PIM and small pore size distribution (PSD) of porous organic polymers (POP), which was synthesized by in situ copolymerization of triptycene&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine as linear part and triptycene&#8208;2,6,13(14)&#8208;triamine (TTA) as crosslinker. The resulting PIM&#8208;3D&#8208;TB membranes demonstrated outstanding separation properties that outperformed the latest trade&#8208;off lines for H2/CH4 and O2/N2. They also showed an anti&#8208;trade&#8208;off effect by simultaneously enhancing gas permeability and gas&#8208;pair selectivity with increasing TTA content. The TTA crosslinking node increased the microporosity, and, shifted the PSD from the ultramicropore (&lt;7&#8197;&#197;) toward the more size sieving submicropore (&lt;4&#8197;&#197;) region. The post&#8208;treated TTA&#8208;75 displayed an exceptional H2 permeability of 8000 Barrer and H2/CH4 selectivity of 208. These PIM&#8208;3D&#8208;TB membranes and their design protocol have unparalleled potential in the next generation of membranes for hydrogen purification and air separations.

         <dc:description>Rational exploration of cost&#8208;effective, durable, and high&#8208;performance electrode materials&#160;is imperative for advancing the progress of capacitive deionization (CDI). The integration of multicomponent layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with conjugated conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) to fabricate bifunctional heterostructure&#160;electrode materials is considered a promising strategy.

         <title>Synergistic Electrode and Electrolyte Polarities Lead to Outstanding Organic Potassium&#8208;based Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic materials are promising as battery electrodes due to their flexible design, low cost, and sustainability. Although high electrolyte concentrations are known to suppress organic cathode dissolution, the organic cathode solubility depends on the interplay between the electrode and electrolyte polarities, which remains unexplored. Here, we elucidate the delicate interplay of electrode and electrolyte polarities to achieve stable cycling of organic cathode. Notably, we demonstrate that the solubility of low&#8208;polar organic cathodes initially increases and subsequently decreases in electrolytes with increasing polarity. In contrast, high&#8208;polar organic cathodes display increasing solubility in electrolytes with increasing polarity. When the polarities of the organic cathodes and the electrolyte are tuned, the batteries show high&#8208;capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency. For example, polyaniline||potassiated graphite (KC8) pouch cells deliver 2500 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.85%. These new insights into low&#8208; and high&#8208;polar organic cathode behavior in electrolytes lay a theoretical foundation for designing new organic battery electrodes and optimizing their electrolyte formulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Water Purification by Template&#8208;Free Nanoconfined Catalysts Derived from Municipal Sludge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoconfinement at the interface of heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like catalysts offers promising avenues for advancing oxidation processes in water purification. Herein, we introduce a template&#8208;free strategy for synthesizing nanoconfined catalysts from municipal sludge (S&#8208;NCCs),&#160;specifically engineered to optimize reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and utilization for rapid pollutant degradation. Using selective hydrofluoric acid corrosion, we create an architecture that confines atomically dispersed Fe centers within a micro&#8208;mesoporous carbon matrix in situ. This method maximizes the utilization of silicon and aluminum content from sludge, prevents metal agglomeration, and&#160;precisely regulates the chemical environment of Fe active sites.&#160;As a result,&#160;the S&#8208;NCCs promote a transition from nonradical to hybrid radical/nonradical reaction mechanisms, significantly enhancing ROS efficiency, stability, and pollutant degradation rates. These catalysts demonstrate exceptional pollutant removal performance, achieving a 261&#8208;fold increase in degradation efficiency for compounds such as phenol and sulfamethoxazole compared to unconfined analogs, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Fenton&#8208;like systems. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of nanoconfined catalysis in environmental applications, providing an effective and scalable solution for sustainable water purification.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the growing importance of planar chiral macrocyclophanes owing to their unique properties in different areas of chemistry, methods that are effective in controlling their planar chirality are restricted to certain molecular scaffolds. Herein, we report the first Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective intermolecular C&#8211;H arylation that induces planar chirality by installing bulky aryl groups through dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). A computer&#8208;assisted approach allowed a fine&#8208;tuning of the structure of the employed chiral bifunctional phosphine&#8208;carboxylate ligands to achieve high enantioselectivities. A range of planar chiral macrocyclophanes were successfully synthesized from configurationally labile macrocyclic precursors via C&#8211;H arylation with various perfluoroarenes. Mechanistic investigations indicated that the reaction proceeds via reversible oxidative addition and enantiodetermining C&#8211;H activation. Selected macrocyclophane products showed interesting photophysical and chiroptical properties, which depended on both the nature of the ansa chains and the aromatic moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Anionic Solvation Barrier for Safe and Durable Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries Under Ultrahigh&#8208;Voltage Operation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrahigh&#8208;voltage potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) with cost competitiveness represent a viable route towards high energy battery systems. Nevertheless, rapid capacity decay with poor Coulombic efficiencies remains intractable, mainly attributed to interfacial instability from aggressive potassium metal anodes and cathodes. Additionally, high reactivity of K metal and flammable electrolytes pose severe safety hazards. Herein, a weakly solvating fluorinated electrolyte with intrinsically nonflammable feature is successfully developed to enable an ultrahigh&#8208;voltage (up to 5.5 V) operation. Through breaking the anionic solvation barrier, synergistic interfacial modulation can be achieved by the formation of robust anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces on both the cathode and anode. As proof of concept, a representative KVPO4F cathode can sustain 1600 cycles with 84.4% of capacity retention at a high cutoff voltage of 4.95 V. Meanwhile, K plating/stripping process in our designed electrolyte also demonstrates optimized electrochemical reversibility and stability with effectively inhibited potassium dendrites. These findings underscore the critical impact of anion&#8208;dominated solvation configuration on synergistic interfacial modulation and electrochemical properties. This work provides new insights into rational design of ultrahigh&#8208;voltage and safe electrolyte for advanced PIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Sprayed Aqueous Microdroplets for Spontaneous Synthesis of Functional Microgels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of sustainable synthesis route to produce functional and bioactive polymer colloids has attracted much attention. Most strategies are based on the polymerization of monomers or crosslinking of prepolymers by enzyme&#8208; or cell&#8208;mediated reactions or specific catalysts in confined emulsions. Herein, a facile solution spray method was developed for spontaneous synthesis of microgels without use of confined emulsion, additional initiators/catalysts and deoxygenation, which addresses the challenges in traditional microgel synthesis. The polarization of air&#8208;water interface of the microdroplets can spontaneously split hydroxide ions in water to produce hydroxyl radicals, thereby initiating polymerization and crosslinking in air environment. This synthesis strategy is applicable to a variety of monomers and enables the fabrication of microgels with tunable chemical structures and variable sizes. Importantly, the synthesis route also allows for the preparation of enzyme&#8208; or drug&#8208;loaded microgels via the in&#8208;situ encapsulation, which also display high enzymatic activity and stimuli&#8208;triggered drug release. Therefore, this work not only is of great significance to macromolecular science and microdroplet chemistry, but also may bring new insights into cellular biochemistry and even prebiotic chemistry due to the prevalence of microdroplets in the environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Covalent Aptamer Chimeras for Enhanced Autophagic Degradation of Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted degradation of membrane proteins represents an attractive strategy for eliminating pathogenesis&#8208;related proteins. Aptamer&#8208;based chimeras hold great promise as membrane protein degraders, however, their degradation efficacy is often hindered by the limited structural stability and the risk of off&#8208;target effects due to the non&#8208;covalent interaction with target proteins. We here report the first design of a covalent aptamer&#8208;based autophagosome&#8208;tethering chimera (CApTEC) for the enhanced autophagic degradation of cell&#8208;surface proteins, including transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and nucleolin (NCL). This strategy relies on the site&#8208;specific incorporation of sulfonyl fluoride groups onto aptamers to enable the cross&#8208;linking with target proteins, coupled with the conjugation of an LC3 ligand to hijack the autophagy&#8208;lysosomal pathway for targeted protein degradation. The chemically engineered CApTECs exhibit enhanced on&#8208;target retention and improved structural stability.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Targeted degradation of membrane proteins represents an attractive strategy for eliminating pathogenesis-related proteins. Aptamer-based chimeras hold great promise as membrane protein degraders, however, their degradation efficacy is often hindered by the limited structural stability and the risk of off-target effects due to the non-covalent interaction with target proteins. We here report the first design of a covalent aptamer-based autophagosome-tethering chimera (CApTEC) for the enhanced autophagic degradation of cell-surface proteins, including transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and nucleolin (NCL). This strategy relies on the site-specific incorporation of sulfonyl fluoride groups onto aptamers to enable the cross-linking with target proteins, coupled with the conjugation of an LC3 ligand to hijack the autophagy-lysosomal pathway for targeted protein degradation. The chemically engineered CApTECs exhibit enhanced on-target retention and improved structural stability. Our results also demonstrate that CApTECs achieve remarkably enhanced and prolonged degradation of membrane proteins compared to the non-covalent designs. Furthermore, the CApTEC targeting TfR1 is combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for synergistic tumor therapy in a mouse model, leading to substantial suppression of tumor growth. Our strategy may provide deep insights into the LC3-mdiated autophagic degradation, affording a modular and effective strategy for membrane protein degradation and precise therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Targeting Macrocyclic Peptides as Nanomolar Inhibitors of Self&#8208; and Cross&#8208;Seeded Amyloid Self&#8208;Assembly of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amyloid self&#8208;assembly of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;Syn) is linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD). Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has recently emerged as a risk factor for PD. Cross&#8208;interactions between their amyloidogenic proteins may act as molecular links. In fact, fibrils of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) (T2D) can cross&#8208;seed &#945;Syn amyloidogenesis and &#945;Syn and IAPP colocalize in PD brains. Inhibition of both self&#8208; and IAPP&#8208;cross&#8208;seeded &#945;Syn amyloidogenesis could thus interfere with PD pathogenesis. Here we show that macrocyclic peptides, designed to mimic IAPP self&#8208;/cross&#8208;interaction sites and previously found to inhibit amyloidogenesis of IAPP and/or Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide A&#946;40(42), are nanomolar inhibitors of both self&#8208; and IAPP&#8208;cross&#8208;seeded amyloid self&#8208;assembly of &#945;Syn. Anti&#8208;amyloid function is mediated by nanomolar affinity interactions with &#945;Syn via three &#945;Syn regions which are identified as key sites of both &#945;Syn self&#8208;assembly and its cross&#8208;interactions with IAPP. We also show that the peptides block A&#946;42&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;seeding of &#945;Syn as well. Based on their broad spectrum anti&#8208;amyloid function and additional drug&#8208;like features, these peptides are leads for multifunctional anti&#8208;amyloid drugs in PD, T2D, AD, and their comorbidities, while the identified &#945;Syn key segments are valuable targets for novel, multi&#8208;site targeting amyloid inhibitors in PD and related synucleinopathies.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimized directed evolution of E. coli leucyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase adds many noncanonical amino acids into the eukaryotic genetic code&#160;including ornithine and N&#949;&#8208;acetyl&#8208;methyllysine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in eukaryotes has predominantly relied on the pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair. However, access to additional easily engineered pairs is crucial for expanding the structural diversity of the ncAA toolbox in eukaryotes. The Escherichia coli&#8208;derived leucyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (EcLeuRS)/tRNA pair presents a particularly promising alternative. This pair has been engineered to charge a small yet structurally diverse group of ncAAs in eukaryotic cells. However, expanding the substrate scope of EcLeuRS has been difficult due to the suboptimal yeast&#8208;based directed evolution platform used for its engineering. In this study, we address this limitation by optimizing the yeast&#8208;based directed evolution platform for efficient selection of ncAA&#8208;selective EcLeuRS mutants. Using the optimized selection system, we demonstrate rapid isolation of many novel EcLeuRS mutants capable of incorporating various ncAAs in mammalian cells, including ornithine and N&#949;&#8208;acetyl&#8208;methyllysine, a recently discovered post&#8208;translational modification in mammalian cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Dry&#8208;Solid&#8208;Electrochemical Synthesis: A General Method for Large Scale Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with High Metal loadings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high metal loadings are highly desirable but still challenging for large scale synthesis. Here we report a new technique named as dry&#8208;solid&#8208;electrochemical synthesis (DSES) for a general large&#8208;scale synthesis of SACs with high metal loadings in an energy&#8208;conservation and environment&#8208;friendly way. With it, a series of pure carbon&#8208;supported metal SACs (Platinum up to 35.0 wt%, Iridium 21.2 wt%, Ruthenium 20.4 wt% and Iron 17.6 wt%) with high metal loadings were obtained. Particularly, a Pt SAC with Pt 23.9 wt% and remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in fuel cells is synthesized on kilogram scale. Based on multiple control experiments, a unique redox mechanism for DSES process is proposed: metal precursors on conductive supports are reduced to metals via a homolytic cleavage of metal&#8208;halogen bonds by the attacking of electrons flowing through the dry solid phase. Such versatile technique paves a new economical and environment&#8208;friendly pathway for fabricating high&#8208;metal&#8208;loading SACs or atomic dispersion catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the CO Tolerance Mechanism in Acidic Hydrogen Oxidation Reactions on Platinum&#8208;Based Catalyst Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of trace CO impurity gas in hydrogen fuel can rapidly deactivate  platinum&#8208;based hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts due to poisoning effects, yet the precise CO tolerance mechanism remains debated. Our designed Au@PtX bifunctional core&#8208;shell nanocatalysts exhibit excellent performance of CO tolerance in acidic solution during HOR and possess exceptional Raman spectroscopy enhancement. Through capturing and analyzing in situ Raman spectroscopy evidences on *OH, metal&#8208;O species and *CO evolution under 0.3 V, we confirm that oxygen&#8208;containing species on PtRu and PtSn catalysts promote the oxidation and desorption of *CO. While Ru enhances *CO adsorption on Pt, the primary CO tolerance performance of PtRu arises from *CO oxidation via a bifunctional pathway. Additionally, electronic structure of Sn reduces *CO adsorption on Pt sites, complementing the bifunctional mechanism to further enhance the CO tolerance performance of PtSn. These discoveries significantly deepen our understanding of the anti&#8208;poisoning mechanism of Pt&#8208;based catalysts in the HOR process and offer valuable insights for rational catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesoporous Single&#8208;Crystal FeFe(CN)6 Microspheres for Superior Potassium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal hexacyanoferrates (HCFs), also known as Prussian blue analogues, are ideal cathodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their nontoxicity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Nevertheless, obtaining metal HCF cathode materials with both long&#8208;term cycling stability and high rate performance remains a daunting challenge. In this study, we present mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline iron hexacyanoferrate (MSC&#8208;FeHCF) microspheres, featuring a single&#8208;crystalline structure that contains interconnected pores spanning the entire crystal lattice. This unique architecture not only enables the electrolyte to fully penetrate into the single crystal, but also shorten the K+ diffusion distance. Additionally, the confinement effect of mesopores on interior water mitigates the excessive side reactions. The stress during battery cycling can be dispersed through multiple paths to alleviate the internal strain. The MSC&#8208;FeHCF microspheres exhibit unprecedented long&#8208;term cycling performance, achieving a specific discharge capacity of 123.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30 mA g&#8722;1 and 87.1 mAh g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 500 mA g&#8722;1, providing 85.8% of the initial capacity. More importantly, the MSC&#8208;FeHCF microspheres exhibit high rate capability, delivering 86.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 A g&#8722;1. This study introduces an innovative strategy for engineering metal HCF cathode materials, thereby opening a novel avenue for the development of high&#8208;efficiency electrode materials for PIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Polyolefins and Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyolefins are simple hydrocarbons that require additional chemical modifications or functional additives to give them custom functions. Recent research in the development of functional polyolefins has surpassed the traditional approach of simply improving surface properties by incorporating polar moieties. Creating custom functionalized polyolefins by using specific functional units has attracted increasing attention. This review summarizes advances in preparing custom functionalized polyolefin materials using functional units such as comonomers, chain&#8208;transfer agents, post&#8208;polymerization modification reagents, and functional fillers. Exploring new functional units and innovative synthetic strategies will further enhance the performance and expand the applications of functional polyolefins.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Multi&#8208;Center&#8208;2&#8208;Electron Bonds for Carbene Metal&#8211;Hydride Nanocluster Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands possess the ability to stabilize metal&#8208;based nanomaterials for a broad range of applications. With respect to metal&#8211;hydride nanomaterials, however, carbenes are rare, which is surprising if one considers the importance of metal&#8211;hydride bonds across the chemical sciences. In this study, we introduce a bottom&#8208;up approach leveraging preexisting metal&#8211;metal m&#8208;center&#8208;n&#8208;electron (mc&#8208;ne) bonds to access a highly stable cyclic(alkyl)amino carbene (CAAC) copper&#8211;hydride nanocluster, [(CAAC)6Cu14H12][OTf]2 with superior stability compared to Stryker&#8217;s reagent, a popular commercial phosphine&#8208;based copper hydride catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the enhanced stability stems from hydride&#8208;to&#8208;ligand backbonding with the &#960;&#8208;accepting carbene. This new cluster emerges as a highly efficient and selective copper&#8211;hydride pre&#8208;catalyst across six reaction classes, thereby providing a bench&#8208;stable alternative for catalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Elemental Germanium Activation and Catalysis Enabled by Mechanical Force</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the realm of materials science and chemical industry, germanium emerges as a strategic resource with distinctive properties that extend its applicability beyond traditional electronics and optics into the promising field of chemical catalysis. Despite its significant role in advanced technological applications, the potential of elemental germanium as a catalyst remains unexplored. Leveraging recent developments in mechanochemistry, this study introduces a groundbreaking approach to activate elemental germanium via mechanical force, facilitating the Reformatsky reaction without the reliance on external reducing agents. Meanwhile, we have also demonstrated, for the first time, the catalytic activity of elemental germanium, successfully achieving this through the bromoalkylation of alkenes. These achievements mark a significant advancement in the field of catalysis and open up a new promising avenue for both academic research and industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable luminescent diradicals, characterized by the presence of two unpaired electrons, exhibit unique photophysical properties that are sensitive to external stimuli such as temperature, magnetic fields, and microwaves. This sensitivity allows the manipulation of their spin states and luminescence, setting them apart from traditional closed&#8208;shell luminescent molecules and luminescent monoradicals. As a result, luminescent diradicals are emerging as promising candidates for a variety of applications. This minireview discusses recent advances in the design and synthesis of luminescent diradicals, explores their photophysical properties, and potential applications. It also examines the challenges and prospects in the development of these materials, shedding light on their potential to drive technological innovation.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Rate Lithium&#8208;Ion Capacitor Diode Towards Multifrequency Ion/Electron&#8208;Coupling Logic Operations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orthorhombic niobium pentoxide (T&#8208;Nb2O5) based lithium&#8208;ion capacitor diode (CAPode) with thoroughly improved response frequency and rectification ratio has been successfully developed. It is demonstrated to be fully competent in typical AND and OR logic gates over a wide frequency range of 1&#8211;100&#8197;Hz, validating great potential in the burgeoning field of multifrequency ion/electron&#8208;coupling logic operations.







Abstract
Ion/electron&#8208;coupling logic operation is recognized as the most promising approach to achieving in&#8208;depth brain&#8208;inspired computing, but the lack of high&#8208;performance ion/electron&#8208;coupling devices with high operating frequencies much restricts the fast development of this field. Accordingly, we herein report an orthorhombic niobium pentoxide (T&#8208;Nb2O5) based lithium&#8208;ion capacitor diode (CAPode) that possesses thoroughly improved performances to achieve multifrequency ion/electron&#8208;coupling logic operations. Specifically, benefiting from the unique crystal structure and fast ion&#8208;transport topology of T&#8208;Nb2O5, the constructed CAPode exhibits a high response frequency of up to 122&#8197;Hz, over three orders of magnitude higher than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CAPodes. Meanwhile, the T&#8208;Nb2O5 based CAPode delivers a record&#8208;high rectification ratio of 108, a high specific capacity of 390&#8197;C&#8201;g&#8722;1, a wide voltage window of &#8722;1.5&#8211;1.5&#8197;V, and a superior cycling stability over 2000 cycles. Combining these performance advantages, the T&#8208;Nb2O5 based CAPode is demonstrated to be fully competent in typical AND and OR logic gates over a wide frequency range of 1&#8211;100&#8197;Hz, validating great potential in the burgeoning field of multifrequency ion/electron&#8208;coupling logic operations.

         <title>Sym&#8208; and Asym&#8208;Expanded Heterohelicene Isomers Featuring Extended Multi&#8208;Resonance Skeleton for Narrowband Deep&#8208;Blue Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sym&#8208; and asym&#8208;expanded heterohelicene isomers were developed by one&#8208;pot borylation synthesis, which exhibit narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission with record&#8208;setting FWHM of 18&#8197;nm and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Corresponding OLED showed superb performance with external quantum efficiency up to 25&#8201;% and small efficiency roll&#8208;off even at high luminance of 10, 000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Expanded heterohelicenes composed of alternating linearly and angularly fused multi&#8208;resonance (MR) skeletons have gained wide interest owing to their promising narrowband emissions. Herein, a pair of sym&#8208; and asym&#8208;expanded heterohelicene isomers was obtained by merging boron/oxygen (B/O)&#8208;embedded MR triangulene and indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole units via one&#8208;pot synthesis. Owing to their fully resonating extended helical skeleton, the target heterohelicenes exhibit a significantly narrowed spectra bandwidth while emission red&#8208;shifting, thus affording deep&#8208;blue narrowband emission with a peak at approximately 460&#8197;nm, full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of only 18&#8197;nm, and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields. In comparison to the symmetrical structure, the asym&#8208;expanded heterohelicene displays suppressed aggregation within doped films, thereby showing superior narrowband electroluminescence in devices with CIE coordinates of (0.12, 0.18) and a high external quantum efficiency of up to 25&#8201;%, which retains 18.1&#8201;% even at a high luminance of 10,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;1. Overall, this work provides a novel paradigm for the development of narrowband expanded heterohelicenes.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Supporting Flexible Electrode for Tracking and Reversible Quantification of Mg2+ and Ca2+ in the Brains of Freely Behaving Animal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a polymer&#8208;based flexible microelectrode (rGPF) with suitable bending stiffness for self&#8208;supporting brain implantation, low Young's modulus, high biocompatibility, and minimal position shifts. Using DFT calculation, we designed Mg2+ and Ca2+ ligands, creating sensors with excellent selectivity, reversibility, and response time, enabling in vivo recording for 90&#8197;days. Our findings revealed Mg2+ inhibited Ca2+ influx and changes in Mg2+ and Ca2+ aligned with neural pathways during seizures.







Abstract
Monitoring dynamic neurochemical signals in the brain of free&#8208;moving animals remains great challenging in biocompatibility and direct implantation capability of current electrodes. Here we created a self&#8208;supporting polymer&#8208;based flexible microelectrode (rGPF) with sufficient bending stiffness for direct brain implantation without extra devices, but demonstrating low Young's modulus with remarkable biocompatibility and minimal position shifts. Meanwhile, screening by density functional theory (DFT) calculation, we designed and synthesized specific ligands targeting Mg2+ and Ca2+, and constructed Mg&#8722;E and Ca&#8722;E sensors with high selectivity, good reversibility, and fast response time, successfully monitoring Mg2+ and Ca2+ in vivo up to 90&#8197;days. Using this powerful tool, we discovered for the first time that, during the 4&#8208;aminopyridine&#8208;induced seizure in the live brain, extracellular Mg2+ inhibited Ca2+ influx. Moreover, the timing of initial changes in Mg2+ and Ca2+ levels during seizures aligned with neural pathways, which had not been previously reported.

         <title>Revealing Intrinsic Free Charge Generation: Promoting the Construction of Over 19% Efficient Planar p&#8208;n Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Revealing the organic semiconductors with specific three&#8208;dimensional tightly stacking and Donor/Acceptor conjugation characteristics can generate intrinsic free charge directly. Hence, we obtain the new efficiency record for planar p&#8208;n heterojunction organic solar cells with excellent stability under various stresses. This will completely change the development of organic photovoltaics and pave a new path for their industrial development.







Abstract
Due to high binding energy and extremely short diffusion distance of Frenkel excitons in common organic semiconductors at early stage, mechanism of interface charge transfer&#8208;mediated free carrier generation has dominated the development of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). However, considering the advancements in materials and device performance, it is necessary to reexamine the photoelectric conversion in current&#8208;stage efficient OSCs. Here, we propose that the conjugated materials with specific three&#8208;dimensional donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated packing potentially exhibit distinctive charge photogeneration mechanism, which spontaneously split Wannier&#8208;Mott excitons to free carriers in pure phases. Subsequently, the pure planar p&#8208;n heterojunction (PHJ) OSCs based on green orthogonal solvents were prepared and exhibited comparable even greater performance to that of BHJ OSCs. More interestingly, by introducing PVDF&#8208;TrFE as intrinsic region to regulate built&#8208;in electric field of the device, the planar p&#8208;i&#8208;n PHJ OSCs achieved much higher efficiency (&gt;18%) and stability. Moreover, a prominent efficiency of over 19% has been obtained via ternary optimization, which is the new efficiency record for PHJ OSCs up to date. This study points towards the distinguishing intrinsic free charge generation mechanism, opens up a new avenue for OSCs to collectively realize high&#8208;efficiency, long&#8208;term duration, and simplified device engineering for future commercialization.

         <title>Sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom Porosity Tuning in Calixarene&#8208;Derived Porous Liquids via Supramolecular Complexation Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom porosity tuning in liquid phase was achieved via the constructure and structure engineering in calixarene&#8208;derived type&#8197;II porous liquids through supramolecular complexation. The well&#8208;maintained permanent porosity was confirmed via pressure swing gas adsorption and altered CO2 physisorption behavior. Slight difference between 4&#8211;5&#8197;&#197; in porosity of the calixarene host caused significant dynamic motion and transport behavior of CO2 and Xe molecules.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom&#8208;level porosity engineering, which is appealing in gas separations, has been demonstrated in solid carbon, polymer, and framework materials but rarely achieved in the liquid phase. In this work, a gas molecular sieving effect in the liquid phase at sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom scale is created via sophisticated porosity tuning in calixarene&#8208;derived porous liquids (PLs). Type&#8197;II PLs are constructed via supramolecular complexation between the sodium salts of calixarene derivatives and crown ether solvents. The chemical structure variation and assembly behavior of the porous host upon PL construction are monitored by spectroscopy&#8208;, X&#8208;ray&#8208;, and neutron&#8208;scattering techniques. The presence of permanent porosity in calixarene&#8208;derived PLs is verified by pressure swing gas uptake, altered CO2 physisorption behavior, and molecular simulations. Sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom porosity tuning within the PL phase is achieved by introducing bulky substituted groups on the benzene ring of the calixarene host, which then greatly affects the dynamic motion and transport behavior of CO2 molecules and the Xe uptake performance. The approach being demonstrated in this work represents a promising pathway to tune and leverage the porosity effect for enhanced gas uptake capacity and selectivity in liquid sorbents.

         <title>Efficient Alkaline&#8208;Free Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic Acid using Electrochemically&#8208;Charged NixCo1&#8208;x(OH)2 as a Redox Mediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel cobalt hydroxide serves as an effective redox medium, which decomposes the traditional oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into independent production processes of hydrogen (H2) and 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). This approach addresses the challenges associated with employing strong alkalis in the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural and eliminates the necessity for a membrane. The introduction of a moderate amount of Co significantly enhanced the dehydrogenation of the substrate, facilitating the efficient oxidation of HMF in pure water, with the yield and selectivity of the product FDCA nearing 100&#8201;%. This base&#8208;free and membrane&#8208;free system demonstrates the promising scalability and broad applicability for sustainable chemical and energy production.







Abstract
Converting biomass&#8208;derived molecules like 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into value&#8208;added products alongside hydrogen production using renewable energy offers significant opportunities for sustainable chemical and energy production. Yet, HMF electrooxidation requires strong alkaline conditions and membranes for efficient conversion. These harsh conditions destabilize HMF, leading to humin formation and reduced product purity, meanwhile membranes increase costs. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a two&#8208;step, decoupling system that operates without strong alkaline conditions and eliminates the need of membranes. In this system, nickel&#8208;cobalt hydroxides serve as effective redox mediators, driving HMF oxidation in pure water. The experimental results showed that Ni0.85Co0.15OOH effectively promotes the dehydrogenation of substrate and achieves a highly efficient oxidation of HMF in pure water, with the selectivity of product 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) approaching 100&#8201;%. This system has been expanded to oxidize various substrates, achieving yields exceeding 92&#8201;% for the corresponding acids of functionalized compounds such as furfuryl alcohol, furfural, benzyl alcohol, and benzaldehyde. By replacing fixed electrodes with flow electrodes, the scalability of decoupling strategy was evaluated for the harvesting of pure solid FDCA, highlighting the broad prospects in practical applications.

         <title>P&#8208;Dopant with Spherical Anion for Stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spherical dopant (Na&#8208;TFPB) was developed to improve the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells via adjusting various factors such as defect passivation ability and doping effect. The doping uniformity of spherical Na&#8208;TFPB is better than that of linear Li&#8208;TFSI. The devices fabricated with the shape&#8208; and radius&#8208;regulated p&#8208;dopant achieve remarkable efficiencies of 24.49&#8201;% and 24.31&#8201;% for CJ&#8208;01 and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, respectively, representing the highest efficiency values recorded for organic dopants to date.

Li&#8208;TFSI/t&#8208;BP is the most widely utilized p&#8208;dopant for hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, its nonuniformity of doping, along with the hygroscopicity and migration of dopants, results in the devices exhibiting limited stability and performance. This study reports on the utilization of a spherical anion derived from the p&#8208;dopant, regulated by its radius and shape, as an alternative to the linear TFSI&#8722; anion. The theoretical and experimental results reveal that the spherical anion significantly increases the doping effect of HTMs due to an enhanced electron transfer from larger dipole moments. The enhanced transfer leads to a shift in the Pb&#8208;6p defect orbitals, resulting in shallower trap states. Moreover, compared to the linear structure of the TFSI&#8722; anion, the anion of sodium tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoro methyl)phenyl]borate (Na&#8208;TFPB) with a larger van der Waals radius and spherical shape offers increased hydrophobicity and migration barriers, which can protect the perovskite crystal and facilitate stable p&#8208;doping of HTMs. The use of Na&#8208;TFPB results in enhanced thermal and ambient stability of PSCs. The devices fabricated with the shape&#8208; and radius&#8208;regulated p&#8208;dopant achieve remarkable efficiencies of 24.49&#8201;% and 24.31&#8201;% for CJ&#8208;01 and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, respectively, representing the highest efficiency values for organic dopants to date. This study underscores the ingenious design of spherical anions of p&#8208;dopants in contrast to the conventional linear anions.

&lt;p&gt;The spherical dopant (Na-TFPB) was developed to improve the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells via adjusting various factors such as defect passivation ability and doping effect. The doping uniformity of spherical Na-TFPB is better than that of linear Li-TFSI. The devices fabricated with the shape- and radius-regulated p-dopant achieve remarkable efficiencies of 24.49&#8201;% and 24.31&#8201;% for &lt;b&gt;CJ-01&lt;/b&gt; and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively, representing the highest efficiency values recorded for organic dopants to date.

         <title>Metallaphotoredox Enabled Single Carbon Atom Insertion into Alkenes for Allene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of mild and efficient methods for molecular editing has become a crucial approach in pharmaceutical discovery. In this work, a photoredox and cobalt&#8208;catalyzed gem&#8208;dibromocyclopropane rearrangement reaction has been devised and applied to the late&#8208;stage allenylation of complex alkenes. In contrast to the harsh conditions of traditional Doering&#8208;LaFlamme reactions, this method features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and compatibility with various functional groups. A series of mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations suggest that this reaction may proceed through tertiary radical and cyclopropane carbene intermediates.







Abstract
Efficient methods for synthesizing allenes from readily available starting materials pose a persistent challenge in organic chemistry. In this work, we present a novel two&#8208;stage protocol for allene synthesis involving the single&#8208;atom insertion into alkenes, facilitated by synergistic photoredox and cobalt catalysis. Diverging from conventional methods such as the Doering&#8208;LaFlamme reaction, this photochemical rearrangement approach operates efficiently under mild conditions in a radical&#8208;based manner. The protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope and demonstrates applicability in the late&#8208;stage diversification of alkene&#8208;containing natural products and bioactive molecules. Preliminary mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations offer insights into the reaction pathway, indicating a radical mechanism involving fleeting cyclopropyl carbene intermediates followed by rapid ring opening to form allenes.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Spiropyran Exchange for Rapid Structural Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiropyrans engage in exchange equilibria with indolinium salts that lead to exchange of the indoline fragments or catalyze spiropyran cross exchange, thereby providing a powerful tool for rapid structural diversification and access to novel spiropyran derivatives.







Abstract
Here we disclose that spiropyrans are able to undergo dynamic covalent exchange via their corresponding merocyanine isomers. In the latter, the indolinium moieties can be exchanged by a Michael&#8208;type addition&#8208;elimination sequence, in which a methylene indoline attacks a merocyanine and subsequently the initial indoline fragment is cleaved. The rate and position of the exchange equilibrium strongly depend on the reaction conditions as well as the substitution pattern on the methylene indoline fragments. Importantly, spiropyran cross exchange is catalyzed by indolinium salts and provides the opportunity for rapid in situ structural diversification of spiropyrans. This was used as synthetic tool to access various, hitherto inaccessible spiropyrans as potential dual&#8208;color photoinitiators for xolography. Moreover, we foresee application to screen dynamic covalent libraries of spiropyrans for photochromic properties and to exploit their light&#8208;sensitivity to bias the thermal equilibrium.

         <title>Scalable and Low&#8208;Energy Synthesis of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by a Seed&#8208;Mediated Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seed&#8208;mediated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) synthetic protocol has been developed under mild conditions. This allows MOF production at temperatures from room temperature to 50&#8201;&#176;C, producing highly crystalline structures with increased defects. These features result in a tenfold activity improvement in catalytic iodination. Additionally, the approach is scalable to gram&#8208;level production, demonstrating its potential toward practical applications.







Abstract
The synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by low energy input has been a long&#8208;term target for practical applications yet remains a great challenge. Herein, we developed a low&#8208;energy MOF growth strategy at a temperature down to 50&#8201;&#176;C by simply introducing seeds into the reaction system. The MOFs are continuously grown on the surface of the seeds at a growth rate dozens of times higher than that of conventional solvothermal synthesis at low temperature, while the resulting MOFs possess high crystallinity, porosity, and stability similar to solvothermal seeds. Remarkably, the obtained MOFs feature high&#8208;density structural defects with Lewis acidity, thereby displaying more than one order of magnitude higher activity than the MOFs obtained by the conventional solvothermal method in the iodination reaction of substituted arenes. This low&#8208;energy synthetic approach is readily scaled up, which would be a significant step forward in the dream of the MOF industry.

         <title>g&#8208;C3N4 S&#8208;Scheme Homojunction through Van der Waals Interface Regulation by Intrinsic Polymerization Tailoring for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2 Evolution and CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A g&#8208;C3N4 homojunction with strong internal interfacial Van der Waals interactions is constructed via in&#8197;situ supramolecular thermal polycondensation. Due to the inherent difference of 0D nanodots and 2D nanoplate, g&#8208;C3N4 bandgap is regulated to realize the construction of S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction, improving the carrier separation efficiency and boosting photocatalytic performance. This finding is crucial for the design of g&#8208;C3N4 homojunction.







Abstract
The effective S&#8208;scheme homojunction relies on the precise regulation of band structure and construction of advantaged charge migration interfaces. Here, the electronic structural properties of g&#8208;C3N4 were modulated through meticulous polymerization of self&#8208;assembled supramolecular precursors. Experimental and DFT results indicate that both the intrinsic bandgap and surface electronic characteristics were adjusted, leading to the formation of an in&#8208;situ reconstructed homojunction interface facilitated by intrinsic van der Waals forces. The homojunction catalyst, composed of g&#8208;C3N4 nanodots and ultra&#8208;thin g&#8208;C3N4 nanoflakes, exhibited a significant S&#8208;scheme carrier separation mechanism, which enhances the utilization of electrons and holes. Consequently, under AM 1.5 light irradiation (~100&#8197;mW/cm2), the g&#8208;C3N4 homojunction photocatalyst achieved a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 580&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1. Furthermore, a reversed CH4 selectivity in CO2 reduction was observed, yielding 80.30&#8197;&#956;mol&#8197;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 96.86&#8201;%, in contrast to the performance of bulk g&#8208;C3N4, which produced only 2.22&#8197;&#956;mol&#8197;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with the 15.69&#8201;% CH4 selectivity. These findings not only highlight the significant potential of the g&#8208;C3N4 homojunction photocatalyst for hydrogen production and CO2 reduction but also propose a superior and effective strategy for optimizing the structural properties of g&#8208;C3N4, which are crucial for the design of photocatalytic reactions.

Furthermore, a reversed CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction was observed, yielding 80.30&#8197;&#956;mol&#8197;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a selectivity of 96.86&#8201;%, in contrast to the performance of bulk g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which produced only 2.22&#8197;&#956;mol&#8197;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with the 15.69&#8201;% CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity. These findings not only highlight the significant potential of the g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; homojunction photocatalyst for hydrogen production and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction but also propose a superior and effective strategy for optimizing the structural properties of g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which are crucial for the design of photocatalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Manipulation on the Structural Defects of Poly (Triazine Imide) Single Crystals for Efficient Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two compositionally complementary comonomers are employed to synthesize poly (triazine imide) single crystal and to continuously manipulate the nature of structural defect, aiming at obtaining the fully conjugated &#960;&#8208;system with atomic precision. By inhibiting the C&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced exciton radiative loss and N&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced nonradiative loss, a record apparent quantum efficiency of 37.8&#8201;% for photocatalytic overall water splitting is achieved.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers, represented by polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs), have risen to prominence as new&#8208;generation photocatalysts for overall water splitting (OWS). Despite considerable efforts, achieving highly crystalline PCNs with minimal structural defects remains a great challenge, and it is also difficult to examine the exact impact of complex defect states on OWS process, which largely limits their quantum efficiency. Herein, we devise a &#8216;in&#8208;situ salt flux&#8217; assisted copolymerization protocol by using nitrogen&#8208;rich and nitrogen&#8208;deficient monomers to precisely manipulate the structural defects of poly (triazine imide) (PTI) single crystals. Stoichiometric control between two comonomers enables continuous tunning of carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;vacancies within PTI, allowing the construction of a series of PTI crystals with different defect states. Theoretical and experimental results unveil the carbon vacancies are related with the radiative decay of excitons, while the nonradiative decay is mainly derived from the nitrogen vacancies. Owing to the effective suppression of both radiative and nonradiative losses, the as&#8208;synthesized PTI achieves a record apparent quantum efficiency of 37.8&#8201;% by one&#8208;step&#8208;excitation OWS. This work highlights the significance of rational control of the structural defects and describes clear structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationships in PTI photocatalyst, offering guidance for the development of polymer photocatalysts for solar fuel production.

         <title>Anchoring Sn Nanoparticles in Necklace&#8208;Like B,N,F&#8208;Doped Carbon Fibers Enables Anode&#8208;Less 5V&#8208;Class Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Necklace&#8208;like B,N,F&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers embedded with Sn nanoparticles are designed as a lightweight and functionalized host for anode&#8208;less 5V&#8208;class Li&#8208;metal batteries. The macroporous framework, B,N,F&#8208;doped carbon, and lithiophilic Sn nanoparticles enable high plating capacity and homogeneous Li deposition towards anode&#8208;less 5V&#8208;class Li&#8208;metal pouch cells with high energy density and stable cycling performance.







Abstract
Li metal batteries (LMBs), particularly with a limited Li metal anode and a 5V&#8208;class cathode, offer significantly higher energy density compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, the limited Li anode poses severe challenges to cycling stability due to low efficiency and large volume expansion issues associated with Li. Herein, we design a lightweight and functionalized host composed of Sn nanoparticles embedded into necklace&#8208;like B,N,F&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Sn@B/N/F&#8208;CMFs) toward anode&#8208;less 5V&#8208;class LMBs. The macroporous framework can decrease the local current density to homogenize Li deposition and release structural stress to realize high areal capacity of over 40&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The lithiophilic B,N,F&#8208;doped carbon and Sn nanoparticles can function as high&#8208;affinity Li+ binding sites to uniformize Li nucleus growth on the internal and external surface of hollow fibers. Accordingly, the Sn@B/N/F&#8208;CMFs enable stable dendrite&#8208;free Li plating/stripping behaviors for 1700&#8197;h even in the carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. When coupled with a 5V&#8208;class LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode, the assembled anode&#8208;less pouch cell also displays stable cycling performance even under harsh conditions.

         <title>Interfacial Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Copper Pair Sites on Inverse CeO2/Cu Catalyst Enable Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol in Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial oxygen vacancy&#8208;neighboring Cu pair sites are identified as the active sites for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol under acidic conditions. By maximizing the density of active pair sites, a high Faradaic efficiency of 48.5&#8201;% and a partial current density of 344.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for ethanol production are achieved over the inverse CeO2/Cu catalyst.







Abstract
Renewable electricity&#8208;driven electrochemical reduction of CO2 offers a promising route for the production of high&#8208;value ethanol. However, the current state of this technology is hindered by low selectivity and productivity, primarily due to a limited understanding of the atomic&#8208;level active sites involved in ethanol formation. Herein, we identify that the interfacial oxygen vacancy&#8208;neighboring Cu (Ov&#8208;Cu) pair sites are the active sites for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol. A linear correlation between the density of Ov&#8208;Cu pair sites and ethanol productivity is experimentally evidenced. Moreover, a high Faradaic efficiency of 48.5&#8201;% and a partial current density of 344.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for ethanol production are achieved over the inverse CeO2/Cu catalyst with a high density of Ov&#8208;Cu pair sites in acid. Mechanistic studies that combine density functional theory calculations and spectroscopic techniques propose an Ov&#8208;involved mechanism where interfacial Ov sites directly activate and dissociate CO2 into *CO in a thermodynamically spontaneous manner, thus favoring the subsequent *CHO formation and asymmetric CHO&#8208;CO coupling. Besides, the asymmetric Ov&#8208;Cu pair sites could preferentially stabilize the *CH2CHOH intermediate, resulting in the favorable formation of ethanol over ethylene. Our findings provide new atomic&#8208;level insights into CO2 electroreduction to ethanol, paving the way for the rational design of future catalysts.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships for s&#8208;Block Metal/Co(III) Heterodinuclear Catalysts in Cyclohexene Oxide Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heterodinuclear catalysts featuring Co(III) in combination with s&#8208;block metals are reported for the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of cyclohexene oxide with phthalic anhydride, and with carbon dioxide at 20 and 1&#8197;bar pressures. Quantifiable structure&#8211;activity trends are observed; activity increases with decreasing s&#8208;block metal Lewis acidity, as measured by the pKa of the s&#8208;block metal aqua complexes. These relationships reveal key mechanistic insights to help inform future catalyst design.







Abstract
In homogeneous catalysis, uncovering structure&#8211;activity relationships remains very rare but invaluable to understand and rationally improve performances. Here, generalizable structure&#8211;activity relationships apply to a series of heterodinuclear polymerization catalysts featuring Co(III) and s&#8208;block metals M(I/II) (M=Na(I), K(I), Ca(II), Sr(II), Ba(II)). These are shown to apply to polycarbonate production by the ring&#8208;opening copolymerizations (ROCOP) of cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), conducted at high (20&#8197;bar) and low (1&#8197;bar) CO2 pressures, and to polyester production by copolymerization of cyclohexene oxide and phthalic anhydride (PA). For the CHO/PA and high&#8208;pressure CHO/CO2 copolymerizations, activity increases exponentially with s&#8208;block metal acidity peaking at the Co(III)K(I) catalyst, whilst for the low&#8208;pressure CHO/CO2 copolymerization it increases linearly to the same metal combination. The polymerization kinetics fit second order rate laws and the correlations support dinuclear metallate mechanistic hypotheses. These relationships help understand and identify key metal complex structural features in synergic polymerization catalysis.

These are shown to apply to polycarbonate production by the ring-opening copolymerizations (ROCOP) of cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), conducted at high (20&#8197;bar) and low (1&#8197;bar) CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressures, and to polyester production by copolymerization of cyclohexene oxide and phthalic anhydride (PA). For the CHO/PA and high-pressure CHO/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; copolymerizations, activity increases exponentially with s-block metal acidity peaking at the Co(III)K(I) catalyst, whilst for the low-pressure CHO/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; copolymerization it increases linearly to the same metal combination. The polymerization kinetics fit second order rate laws and the correlations support dinuclear metallate mechanistic hypotheses. These relationships help understand and identify key metal complex structural features in synergic polymerization catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Products by Modulating the Surface Microenvironment of Electrode with Polyethylene Glycol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEG was incorporated into the Cu electrode, achieving an FEC2+ of 90.3&#8201;% at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This modification relaxes Nafion, increasing active site availability and enhancing *CO and *OH adsorption, promoting C&#8722;C coupling. Simultaneously, the restructured hydrogen bond network reduces active hydrogen species, suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Modulating the surface microenvironment of electrodes stands as a pivotal aspect in enhancing the electrocatalytic performance for CO2 electroreduction. Herein, we propose an innovative approach by incorporating a small amount of linear oligomer, polyethylene glycol (PEG), into Cu2O catalysts during the preparation of the CuPEG electrode. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward multicarbon products (C2+) increases from 69.3&#8201;% over Cu electrode without PEG to 90.3&#8201;% over CuPEG electrode at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;M KOH in a flow cell. In situ investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that PEG molecules significantly modify the microenvironment on the Cu surface through hydrogen bond interactions. This modification leads to the relaxation of Nafion, increasing the availability of active sites and enhancing the adsorption of *CO and *OH, which in turn promotes C&#8722;C coupling. Concurrently, the reconstructed hydrogen bond network reduces the presence of active hydrogen species, thereby inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Tyrosinase&#8208;Catalyzed Peptide Stapling Using Para&#8208;Amino Phenylalanine and Tyrosine Anchoring Residues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tyrosinase&#8208;catalyzed side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain peptide stapling between p&#8208;amino phenylalanine (Z) and tyrosine (Y) amino acids has been developed.







Abstract
Peptide stapling techniques have historically relied on metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical reactions, with no examples using enzymes. Here, inspired by tyrosinase&#8208;mediated oxidation, we describe the efficient side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain coupling of p&#8208;amino phenylalanine (Z) and tyrosine (Y) amino acids using a commercially available tyrosinase. Stapling reactions between the i, i+3 to i, i+7 positions were all performed, proceeding in good conversion and under mild conditions compatible with various side chains, functional motifs and ring sizes, with the Z&#8722;Y product found to be more stable and obtained in a higher yield than the Y&#8722;Z product. Z&#8722;Y stapled versions of ER, MC4 and GPR54 binding peptides exhibited higher serum stability, helical content and binding affinity than their linear counterparts, proving the utility of our method to synthesize biologically significant peptides. The tyrosinase&#8208;catalyzed Z&#8722;Y peptide stapling technique expands the scope of available stapling techniques, and is proposed to develop stapled peptide drug candidates.

         <title>Porous Supramolecular Crystalline Materials for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous supramolecular crystalline materials (PSCMs) are a type of porous supramolecular assemblies stabilized by hydrogen&#8208;bonding, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and other non&#8208;covalent interactions, which have shown great potential in photocatalysis by virtue of their unique features of well&#8208;defined and synthetically tailorable structures, mild synthesis conditions, easy healing and regeneration. In this Minireview, we summarize the syntheses, structural features and photocatalytic applications for PSCMs, including CO2 reduction, H2 evolution, H2O2 production, organic transformation and pollutant degradation. The challenges and opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance PSCMs&#8208;based photocatalysts are also put forward.







Abstract
Porous supramolecular crystalline materials (PSCMs), such as hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), &#960; frameworks, can be defined as a type of porous supramolecular assemblies stabilized by hydrogen&#8208;bonding, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and other non&#8208;covalent interactions. Benefiting from the unique features of mild synthesis conditions, well&#8208;defined and synthetically tailorable structures, easy healing and regeneration, PSCMs have garnered widespread interest in research fields including molecular recognition, sensor, gas storage and separation. Moreover, they have emerged as promising photocatalysts because these PSCMs could be readily endowed with optical function, and the hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking can offer channels for electron transfer to boost the photocatalytic activity. However, the research on PSCMs for photocatalysis is still at an early stage, and a review on this topic would help to promote the development of supramolecular chemistry. In this Minireview, we first introduce the synthesis methods for PSCMs, and then highlight their advantages in photocatalysis. Subsequently, we summarize the applications of PSCMs in photocatalysis including CO2 reduction, H2 evolution, H2O2 production, organic transformation and pollutant degradation, and we put particular emphasis on delineating the structure&#8208;performance relationship. At the end, we discuss the challenges and perspectives in developing high&#8208;performance PSCM&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Bridged S&#8722;N&#8722;Cu Sites for CO2 Photoreduction to Ethanol with 99.5&#8201;% Selectivity in Pure Water</title>

         <dc:description>
A red polymer carbon nitride consisting of S&#8722;N and Cu&#8722;N4 dual active sites is designed to achieve an impressive ethanol evolution rate of 50.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 99.5&#8201;% selectivity for CO2 photoreduction in pure water.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to ethanol is extremely challenging due to the limited efficiency of charge separation, sluggish kinetics of C&#8722;C coupling, and unfavorable formation of oxygenate intermediates. Here, we elaborately design a red polymer carbon nitride (RPCN) consisting of S&#8722;N and Cu&#8722;N4 dual active sites (Cu/S&#8208;RPCN) to address this challenge, which achieves an impressive ethanol evolution rate of 50.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 99.5&#8201;% selectivity for CO2 photoreduction in pure water. Cu and S atoms within the Cu&#8722;N&#8722;S configuration can serve as trapping centers for electrons and holes, respectively, providing spatial separation for photogenerated charge carriers. The incorporation of S atoms optimizes the adsorption of *CO on Cu atoms and reduces the energy barrier for the formation of *CO&#8722;COH intermediate. The adsorption strength of *OCHCH2OH intermediate on the Cu atoms via the O&#8722;Cu&#8722;C configuration can affect the selectivity of the C2 products as the cleavage of the Cu&#8722;O/Cu&#8722;C bonds determines the ethanol/ethylene pathway. The S&#8722;N&#8722;Cu structure weakens the Cu&#8722;O bond, thereby promoting the production of ethanol. This work provides a novel approach to fine&#8208;tune the surrounding microenvironment of metal atoms on carbon nitride for highly effective photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to ethanol.

         <title>Unveiling Chirality in MoS2 Nanosheets: A Breakthrough in Phase Engineering for Enhanced Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductor 2H Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets with high chiroptical activity have been produced using a novel synthetic strategy based on phase engineering. Our approach is based on the conversion of chiral metastable metallic 1T MoS2 nanosheets into the thermodynamically stable 2H phase via a thermal annealing step specifically designed to preserve the chiral morphology during the metallic&#8208;to&#8208;semiconductor phase transition.







Abstract
The development of new synthetic strategies to introduce and control chirality in inorganic nanostructures has been highly stimulated by the broad spectrum of potential applications of these exiting nanomaterials. Molybdenum disulfide is among the most investigated transition metal dichalcogenides due to its promising properties for applications that spread from optoelectronic to spintronic. Herein, we report a new two&#8208;step approach for the production of chiroptically active semiconductor 2H MoS2 nanosheets with chiral morphology based on the manipulation of their crystallographic structure. In the first step, metastable metallic 1T MoS2 nanosheets with chiral morphology were produced via hydrothermal synthesis. Then, thermal annealing was used to progressively tune the conversion of the metallic 1T phase into the thermodynamically stable semiconductor 2H phase while preserving the nanocrystals&#8217; chiral morphology. Our detailed study covers the evolution of the chiroptical properties of the material during the crystallographic phase transition, revealing critical insights into the formation of chiroptically active excitonic transitions. This study represents a unique approach to the production of high&#8208;quality chiral nanomaterials by exploiting phase engineering, and paves the way for the development of new synthetic methods to further expand the range and properties of chiral nanomaterials.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking of FeN4 Moiety via Edge Defects for Acidic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through morphology engineering, asymmetric edge&#8208;carbon is introduced into Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts, effectively breaking the symmetry of the FeN4 structure and enabling precise control over its geometric and electronic properties, thereby enhancing catalytic activity for the acidic oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts, with a planar D4h symmetric FeN4 structure, show promising as noble metal&#8208;free oxygen reduction reaction catalysts. Nonetheless, the highly symmetric structure restricts the effective manipulation of its geometric and electronic structures, impeding further enhancements in oxygen reduction reaction performance. Here, a high proportion of asymmetric edge&#8208;carbon was successfully introduced into Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts through morphology engineering, enabling the precise modulation of the FeN4 active site. Electrochemical experimental results demonstrate that FeN4@porous carbon (FeN4@PC), featuring enriched asymmetric edge&#8208;FeN4 active sites, exhibits higher acidic oxygen reduction reaction catalytic activity compared to FeN4@flaky carbon (FeN4@FC), where symmetric FeN4 is primarily distributed within the basal&#8208;plane. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectra, X&#8208;ray emission spectra, and theoretical calculations indicate that the enhanced oxygen reduction reaction catalytic activity of FeN4@PC is attributed to the higher oxidation state of Fe species in the edge structure of FeN4@PC. This finding paves the way for controlling the local geometric and electronic structures of single&#8208;atom active sites, leading to the development of novel and efficient Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts.

         <title>Competitive Coordination and Dual Interphase Regulation of MOF&#8208;Modified Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a MOF&#8208;Modified PEO&#8208;based SPEs for sodium metal batteries. Benefitting from the competitive coordination with PEO and TFSI&#8722; anions, the open metal sites (OMS) of Cu&#8208;MOF effectively weaken Na+&#8722;O bonds and facilitate Na+ migration. More importantly, the formed NaF/Na3N&#8208;rich CEI/SEI layers contribute to realize dual interphase regulation.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have emerged as prominent candidates for solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to their enhanced flexibility and reduced interfacial resistance. However, their performance is limited by poor Na+ conductivity at room temperature, disordered ion transport properties and unstable interfaces. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) interconnected copper metal&#8211;organic framework (Cu&#8208;MOF) on polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers is introduced into polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based SPEs to construct a composite electrolyte (PPNM). The open metal sites (OMS) of the Cu&#8208;MOF compete with Na+, effectively coordinating with TFSI&#8722; anions and oxygen atoms in PEO, thereby reducing concentration polarization, weakening the Na+&#8722;O binding strength and facilitating Na+ migration. By harnessing the multifunctional properties of Cu&#8208;MOF and PAN, the PPNM electrolyte exhibits superior ionic conductivity (1.03&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and a high Na+ transference number (0.58) at room temperature. The strong anchoring of TFSI&#8722; anions by Cu&#8208;MOF promotes the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich (NaF and Na3N) cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers, enhancing dual interfacial stability. The Na3V2(PO4)3@C/PPNM/Na full cells realize robust cycling performance for 2000 cycles at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work provides a facile strategy for regulating the Na+ coordination state and interphase engineering in solid&#8208;state SMBs.

         <title>Ultrastable Imidazole&#8208;linked Porous Organic Cages for Ammonia Capture and Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile one&#8208;pot synthesis has been developed for a new class of porous organic cages (POCs) with imidazole linkages, which exhibit remarkable chemical stability in harsh environments, including strong acidic and alkaline solutions, rendering them promising candidates for ammonia capture and detection.







Abstract
Here, we report the facile synthesis of imidazole&#8208;linked porous organic cages (IPOCs) via an in situ cyclization reaction protocol. Specifically, three IPOCs with [2+4] lantern&#8208;like structures and one with a [3+6] triangular prism structure were successfully prepared through condensation reactions between tetraformyl&#8208;functionalized calix[4]arene and bis(o&#8208;phenylenediamine) monomers in a single pot. Notably, these IPOCs exhibit high porosity, with Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) specific surface areas reaching up to 1162&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, they demonstrate excellent chemical stability in both strong acidic and alkaline solutions. Furthermore, IPOC&#8208;2 and IPOC&#8208;4 display a remarkable NH3 capturing capability, with uptakes of up to 11.5&#8197;mmol g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K, surpassing most reported porous organic materials. Additionally, IPOC&#8208;1 exhibits highly efficient fluorescent quenching sensing of aqueous NH3, with a detection limit as low as 3.35&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;M. These findings strongly suggest the potential for widespread use of imidazole linkages in the development of robust functional porous organic cage materials for diverse applications.

         <title>Regioisomeric &#960;&#8208;Extended Nanographene with Long&#8208;Lived Phosphorescence Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying the connecting position of the nanographene to the carbazole core (2,7&#8722; and 3,6&#8722;) leads to the formation of bent and helical &#960;&#8208;extended nanographenes displaying distinct excited&#8208;state characteristics. Among the regioisomeric nanographenes, the bent nanographene shows a strong red afterglow exceeding 30&#8197;seconds suggesting a clear correlation between the structure and properties of the &#960;&#8208;extended nanographenes.







Abstract
The cutouts of graphene sheets, particularly those with a nonplanar topology, present vast opportunities for advancement. Even a slight deviation from the planar structure can lead to intriguing (chiro)optical features for helically twisted nanographenes.

&lt;p&gt;Modifying the connecting position of the nanographene to the carbazole core (2,7&#8722; and 3,6&#8722;) leads to the formation of bent and helical &#960;-extended nanographenes displaying distinct excited-state characteristics. Among the regioisomeric nanographenes, the bent nanographene shows a strong red afterglow exceeding 30&#8197;seconds suggesting a clear correlation between the structure and properties of the &#960;-extended nanographenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cutouts of graphene sheets, particularly those with a nonplanar topology, present vast opportunities for advancement. Even a slight deviation from the planar structure can lead to intriguing (chiro)optical features for helically twisted nanographenes. In this context, we introduce two regioisomeric &#960;-extended nanographenes that exhibit distinct excited-state characteristics. The helicene structure and the photophysical features can be easily tuned by changing the connecting position of the nanographene to the carbazole core (2,7&#8722; and 3,6&#8722;). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of nanographenes with bent and helical conformations. Both derivatives exhibited thermally activated delayed fluorescence at room temperature and phosphorescence at low temperatures. Notably, the nanographene with the bent structure displayed an impressive red afterglow lasting over 30&#8197;seconds, in contrast to the very weak afterglow observed in the helical structure. DFT calculations revealed the existence of an isoenergetic higher triplet state (T&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) and comparatively weak spin-orbit coupling (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), thereby enabling the bent nanographene to exhibit a long-lived component and strong afterglow. Our findings highlight the significance of regioisomeric nanographenes with exceptional optical properties and offer a deeper understanding of the structure&#8211;property relationship in nonplanar nanographenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Active Hydroxyl&#8208;Mediated Preferential Cleavage of Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bonds in Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalyst of Ni0.1Co0.9 alloy embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes decorated with Ni&#8722;Co dual&#8208;atoms is constructed for glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR). The active *OH makes the GOR follow a direct oxidation pathway occurring at lower potentials. The optimized electronic state of Co single&#8208;atom regulated by Ni single&#8208;atom and Ni0.1Co0.9 alloy promotes *OH&#8208;mediated preferential cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds, leading to a high formate yield.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) to produce high&#8208;value formic acid (FA) is hindered by high formation potential of active species and sluggish C&#8722;C bond cleavage kinetics. Herein, Ni single&#8208;atom (NiSA) and Co single&#8208;atom (CoSA) dual sites anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes embedded with Ni0.1Co0.9 alloy (Ni0.1Co0.9@NiSACoSA&#8208;NCNTs) are constructed for electrochemical GOR. Remarkably, it can reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low potential of 1.15&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and realize a high formate selectivity of 93.27&#8201;% even at high glycerol conversion of 98.81&#8201;% at 1.45&#8197;V vs. RHE. The GOR mechanism and pathway are systematically elucidated via experimental analyses and theoretical calculations. It is revealed that the active hydroxyl (*OH) can be produced during the GOR. The NiSA, CoSA, and Ni0.1Co0.9 synergistically optimizes the electronic structure of CoSA active sites, reducing the energy barriers of *OH&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds and dehydrogenation of C1 intermediates. This decreases the number of reaction intermediates and reaction steps of GOR&#8208;to&#8208;FA, thus increasing the formate production efficiency. After coupling GOR with hydrogen evolution reaction in a membrane electrode assembly cell, 14.26&#8197;g of formate and 23.10&#8197;L of H2 are produced at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 108&#8197;h.

         <title>CO2 Reduction at a Borane&#8208;Modified Iron Complex: A Secondary Coordination Sphere Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a bifunctional {Fe&#8208;H/Cp*&#8208;BCy2} (Cp* = C5Me5&#8722;) complex, which includes both iron&#8208;hydride and Lewis acid (borane) components, we demonstrate controlled CO2 reactivity to yield a formoxy borane&#8208;bound ferra(II)lactone [(&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5&#8208;CH2&#8208;CO2(BCy2O2CH))FeII(diphosphine)] that incorporates two equivalents of reduced CO2. With excess HBCy2, we additionally establish catalytic dihydroboration of CO2 to produce the bis&#8208;acetal, Cy2BOCH2OBCy2 at room temperature (TON = 220&#8197;h&#8722;1).







Abstract
This work addresses fundamental questions that deepen our understanding of secondary coordination sphere effects on carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction using derivatized hydride analogues of the type, [Cp*Fe(diphosphine)H] (Cp* = C5Me5&#8722;) &#8211; a well&#8208;studied family of organometallic complex &#8211; as models. More precisely, we describe the general reactivity of [(Cp*&#8208;BR2)Fe(diphosphine)H], which contains an intramolecularly positioned Lewis acid, and its cooperative reactivity with CO2. Control experiments underscore the critical nature of borane incorporation for transforming CO2 to reduced products, a reaction that does not occur for unfunctionalized [Cp*Fe(diphosphine)H]. Additional experiments highlight relevance of borane hybridization and substituent effects. Mechanistic studies performed in the presence and absence of CO2 emphasize the significance of carbonyl substrate to catalyst longevity. Lessons from these reactions were also transferable &#8211; with such borane&#8208;containing complexes enabling the chemoselective reduction of aldehydes in the presence of alkenes. These findings provide valuable insights into metal&#8208;ligand cooperative design strategies for carbonyl reduction and illustrate the versatility of intramolecularly positioned Lewis acids for otherwise challenging chemical transformations.

         <title>Chlorine&#8208;Doped SnO2 Nanoflowers on Nickel Hollow Fiber for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorine&#8208;doped SnO2 nanoflowers were grown on a hollow fiber electrode with a 3D hierarchical porous structure for exclusive and stable CO2 conversion to formate at ampere&#8208;level current densities. An extremely high CO2 single&#8208;pass conversion rate of 93&#8201;% is achieved through the significantly enhanced mass transfer, well&#8208;retained Sn4+ species and favorable *OCHO intermediate formation.







Abstract
Renewable energy&#8208;driven electrochemical CO2 reduction has emerged as a promising technology for a sustainable future. However, achieving efficient production of storable liquid fuels at ampere&#8208;level current densities remains a significant hurdle in the large&#8208;scale implementation of CO2 electroreduction. Here we report a novel catalytic electrode comprising chlorine&#8208;doped SnO2 nanoflowers arrayed on the exterior of three&#8208;dimensional nickel hollow fibers. This electrode demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic performance for converting CO2 to formate, achieving a remarkable formate selectivity of 99&#8201;% and a CO2 single&#8208;pass conversion rate of 93&#8201;% at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent stability, maintaining a formate selectivity of above 94&#8201;% for 520&#8197;h at a current density of 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Experimental results combined with theoretical calculations confirm that the enhanced mass transfer facilitated by the hollow fiber penetration effect, coupled with the well&#8208;retained Sn4+ species and Sn&#8722;Cl bonds, synergistically elevates the activity of CO2 conversion. The incorporation of chlorine into SnO2 enhances electron transport and CO2 adsorption, substantially lowering the reaction energy barrier for the crucial intermediate *OCHO formation, and boosting the formate production.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Borrowing&#8208;Based Methods for the Construction of Quaternary Stereocentres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of the hydrogen borrowing manifold to access &#945;&#8208;quaternary ketones through a tandem acceptorless dehydrogenation&#8208;cyclisation cascade is presented. This new application of the methodology results in the formation of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered carbocycles with a high degree of diastereoselectivity. Interestingly, benzylic alcohol substrates behaved anomalously and eliminated sulfinate in&#8197;situ to give a set of rearranged &#945;&#8208;quaternary ketone products.







Abstract
Compounds containing quaternary stereocentres are a valuable motif in biologically active compounds. Herein we present our strategy to utilise the hydrogen borrowing manifold to access &#945;&#8208;quaternary ketones via a tandem acceptorless dehydrogenation&#8208;cyclisation cascade. This new application of the methodology results in the formation of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered carbocycles with a high degree of diastereoselectivity. Interestingly, benzylic alcohol substrates behaved anomalously and eliminated sulfinate in&#8197;situ to give a set of rearranged &#945;&#8208;quaternary ketone products.

         <title>Unlocking Mesoscopic Disorder in Graphitic Carbon with Spectroelectrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that graphitic carbon electrodes exhibit electric&#8208;field dependent infrared activity that is sensitive to the bulk mesoscopic intrinsic disorder. Our combined experimental and theoretical work provides a roadmap for elucidating mesoscopic disorder in graphitic carbon electrode materials under potential bias.







Abstract
Intrinsic structural and oxidic defects activate graphitic carbon electrodes towards electrochemical reactions underpinning energy conversion and storage technologies. Yet, these defects can also disrupt the long&#8208;range and periodic arrangement of carbon atoms, thus, the characterization of graphitic carbon electrodes necessitates in&#8208;situ atomistic differentiation of graphitic regions from mesoscopic bulk disorder. Here, we leverage the combined techniques of in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy and first&#8208;principles calculations to reveal that graphitic carbon electrodes exhibit electric&#8208;field dependent infrared activity that is sensitive to the bulk mesoscopic intrinsic disorder. With this platform, we identify graphitic regions from amorphous domains by discovering that they demonstrate opposing electric&#8208;field&#8208;dependent infrared activity under electrochemical conditions. Our work provides a roadmap for identifying mesoscopic disorder in bulk carbon materials under potential bias.

         <title>Functionalization of Pyridines at the C4 Position via Metalation and Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
n&#8208;Butylsodium can be used to selectively deprotonate pyridine at the C4 position, in sharp contrast to organolithium reagents which lead to nucleophilic addition at the C2 position. A wide range of 4&#8208;alkyl pyridines and 4&#8208;aryl pyridines were synthesized by this protocol. Rapid injection NMR studies indicate that the interchange of different sodiopyridine species follows thermodynamic distribution and results in the selection of the C4 position.







Abstract
The functionalization of pyridines at positions remote to the N&#8208;atom remains an outstanding problem in organic synthesis. The inherent challenges associated with overriding the influence of the embedded N&#8208;atom within pyridines was overcome using n&#8208;butylsodium, which provided an avenue to deprotonate and functionalize the C4&#8208;position over traditionally observed addition products that are formed with organolithium bases. In this work, we show that freshly generated 4&#8208;sodiopyrdines could undergo transition metal free alkylation reactions directly with a variety of primary alkyl halides bearing diverse functional groups. In addition, after transmetalation to zinc chloride a simple and efficient Negishi cross&#8208;coupling protocol was formulated for a variety of aromatic and heteroaromatic halides. The robustness of this protocol was demonstrated through the late&#8208;stage installation of 4&#8208;pyridyl fragments into a variety of complex active pharmaceutical ingredients including loratadine and prochlorperazine. Furthermore, through rapid injection NMR investigations, we are able to directly observe the evolution of anionic intermediates and determined that two distinct mechanistic pathways lead to the observed site selectivity: (1) the C4&#8208;H within 2,6&#8208;disubstituted pyridines could be removed directly and (2) the C4 selectivity of unsubstituted pyridine originates from the intermolecular exchange of metalation sites via a thermodynamic pathway.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Micelle&#8208;Driven Hydrodefluorination for Accessing Unprotected Monofluorinated Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micelles derived from non&#8208;ionic surfactants serve a dual purpose as both solvents and electrolytes, facilitating a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, eco&#8208;friendly hydrodefluorination reaction and thereby minimizing the environmental impact. By utilizing aqueous micelles of PS&#8208;750&#8208;M in the presence of an electric field, an efficient hydrodefluorination of diverse difluorinated indoles is accomplished. This approach reduces waste, enhances atom economy, and enables recycling of aqueous micelles.







Abstract
Toxic organic solvents and electrolytes, traditionally indispensable for electro&#8208;organic synthesis, are now being reconsidered. In developing more sustainable electro&#8208;organic synthesis, we've harnessed the aqueous micelles as solvents and electrolyte&#8208;like structures when deformed under an electric field. The technology is showcased in synthetically highly valued hydrodefluorination reactions of difluorinated indoles. This mild electrosynthetic method produces monofluorinated unprotected indole scaffolds. Our approach minimizes waste and enhances atom economy, reducing reliance on expensive and hazardous solvents and electrolytes. The surfactant's potential for recycling was verified for two cycles. Cyclic voltammetry analysis has corroborated that PS&#8208;750&#8208;M micelles in water establish a more efficient platform for hydrodefluorination. Our technology simplifies the production of monofluorinated indoles, which are crucial for many drug&#8208;like molecules.

         <title>Front Cover: Tailoring the Properties of Chemically Recyclable Polyethylene&#8208;Like Multiblock Polymers by Modulating the Branch Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclable polyethylene&#8208;like multiblock polymers offer tunable mechanical properties spanning LLDPE and LDPE while maintaining high melting temperatures. Synthesized using dehydrogenative polymerization, the glass transition temperature of these materials can be modulated through side&#8208;chain branching. They demonstrate chemical recyclability, selective depolymerization in mixed streams, and adjustable adhesive strength, promoting circularity and sustainable solutions for the plastic waste crisis, as reported by Garret M. Miyake et al in their Research Article (e202415707).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetocapacitance has been studied for the first time in molecular complexes. The weak interaction between cations and anions in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials triggers their structural thermal phase transition. The distinguished Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions in high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature phases lead to different magnetoelectric coupling, as reported by Zhao&#8208;Bo Hu, Yan Peng, Jing Ma, You Song et al. in their Research Article (e202416380).

         <title>Front Cover: Interdependence of Support Wettability, Electrodeposition Rate, Sodium Metal Anode and SEI Microstructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrodeposition of sodium metal in an anode&#8208;free battery can be dendritic. The tree at the center of the cover image represents a single crystalline dendrite, branched and complex in its morphology, originating at the support and growing towards the cathode. Its multicolor leaves are the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that cover the metal surface. The SEI is a complex mosaic containing crystalline sodium fluoride, sodium hydride and sodium hydroxide, as well as organic constituents. Details of this study are reported by David Mitlin, Yu&#8208;chen Karen Chen&#8208;Wiegart et al. in their Research Article (e202412550).

         <title>Aminopeptidase N&#8208;Activated Self&#8208;immolative Hydrogen Sulfide Donor for Inflammatory Response&#8208;Specific Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays crucial inflammatory modulating roles, representing a promising candidate for anti&#8208;inflammatory therapies. However, current H2S delivery approaches lack sufficient specificity against inflammatory response. Herein, regarding the overexpressed  aminopeptidase N (APN) at the inflammation sites, an APN&#8208;activated self&#8208;immolative carbonyl sulfide (COS)/H2S donor (AlaCOS) was developed for inflammatory response&#8208;specific H2S delivery. The compound showed sustained H2S generation upon APN activation in the presence of carbonic anhydrase (CA), and the responsiveness could be well regulated by modulating the amino acid sequence. Due to the inflammatory response&#8208;specific sustained H2S delivery, AlaCOS provided potent anti&#8208;inflammatory capability, which was further validated by RNA sequencing. In vivo experiments on a full&#8208;thickness cutaneous wound murine model also showed the strong promoting effect on wound healing, mainly due to the regulation of the inflammatory response by AlaCOS. By introducing a caged coumarin fluorophore to the molecular architecture, self&#8208;reporting fluorescence could be generated accompanied with APN&#8208;mediated COS/H2S release, which achieved the visualization of H2S delivery in vitro and in vivo. This work not only offers a useful tool for studying the bioactivity of H2S on inflammation, but also provides new insights for developing novel therapies to cope with inflammation&#8208;associated diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogenated Trityl Cations as Easy&#8208;to&#8208;Access Super Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present the first easy&#8208;to&#8208;access synthesis of the perfluorotrityl cation (15F+) with commercial GaCl3 and the further functionalization of the para&#8208;fluorine atoms of 15F+ via halodefluorination using trimethylsilyl halides TMSX (X = Cl, Br). This gives access to equally reactive perhalogenated trityl derivatives (p&#8208;3Cl12F+ and p&#8208;3Br12F+), which can be handled at room temperature. The impact of the para&#8208;exchange on the electronic structure is determined by NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. Finally, the new synthons' high hydride ion affinities are demonstrated computationally and experimentally by hydride abstraction from the short&#8208;chain, linear alkanes n&#8208;pentane and n&#8208;butane.</dc:description>

         <title>An Anionic Mesoionic Carbene (anMIC) and its Transformation to Metallo MIC&#8208;Boranes: Synthesis and Properties.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neutral mesoionic carbenes (MICs) based on a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole core have had a strong impact on various branches of chemistry such as homogeneous catalysis, electrocatalysis, and photochemistry/photophysics. We present here the first general synthesis of anionic mesoionic carbenes (anMICs) based on a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole core and a borate backbone. The free anMIC is stable in solution under an inert atmosphere at low temperatures, and can be stored for several weeks. Analysis of donor properties shows that these anMICs are extremely strong &#963;&#8208;donors, bypassing the donor properties of strong donors such as MICs, NHCs, anionic NHCs and N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins. The room temperature conversion of the free anMICs leads to three equally interesting compound classes: an amide&#8208;coordinated borane based on a MIC&#8208;borane backbone, a polymeric triazolide and an amide&#8208;coordinated metallo&#8208;MIC&#8208;borane. The metallo&#8208;MIC&#8208;borane is an interesting precursor for the synthesis of further amide&#8208;coordinated MIC&#8208;borane compounds. Quantum chemical calculations have been used to elucidate the mechanism of transformation of the anMICs. Gold(I) complexes of the anMIC ligands are potent catalysts for the hydroamination of alkynes without the need for any additional reagents. We thus introduce three new categories of mesoionic compounds here with potential for different branches of chemistry and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>CO Adsorption on a Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Stably Embedded in Graphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Confined single metal atoms in graphene&#8208;based materials have proven to be excellent catalysts for several reactions and promising gas sensing systems. However, whether the chemical activity arises from the specific type of metal atom or is a direct consequence of the confinement itself remains unclear.
In this work, through a combined density functional theory&#160;and experimental surface science study, we address this question by investigating Co and Ni single atoms embedded in graphene (Gr) on a Ni(111) support. These two single atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit opposite behavior toward carbon monoxide (CO) gas molecules: at RT, CO binds stably to Co, whereas it does not to Ni. We rationalize this difference by the energy position of&#160;trapped metal dxz and dyz states involved in &#960; backdonation to CO: while for Co, these states lie at the Fermi level, for Ni are located deep below it.
This conclusion is corroborated by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, where a Gr/Ni(111) sample containing both stable Ni and Co single atoms was exposed to a CO partial pressure of 5 &#8231; 10&#8208;7 mbar. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) measurements confirm the selective adsorption of CO on Co at RT.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissociation&#8211;Precipitation Chemistry of Lithium Polysulfides and Its Correlation to Dynamic Evolution of Cathode&#8211;Electrolyte Interphase in Highly Solvating Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries has been regarded as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density. However, the practical application of Li&#8211;S batteries is still hindered by the unstable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase and the early passivation of charge product (Li2S), leading to poor cycling stability and low S utilization. Herein, we propose an electrolyte engineering strategy using highly solvating hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) as a co&#8208;solvent to elucidate the dissociation&#8211;precipitation chemistry of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The multimode optical spectroscopies confirm that this electrolyte engineering is able to effectively regulate the solvation of LiPSs to initiate a radical&#8208;assisted conversion pathway and control three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Li2S electrodeposition to boost sulfur utilization. More importantly, the dynamic evolution of cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase, featuring with S&#8208;/P&#8208;containing species, is also assessed by both distribution of relaxation times technology and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which can suppress the passivation of Li2S to enhance conversion reversibility. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a Li&#8211;S cell with high S loading mass of 7.75 mg cm&#8722;2 demonstrates an extremely high area capacity of 7.86 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a current density of 1.30 mA cm&#8722;2 , representing a significant advancement in promoting the development of practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;induced Enhancement of Energetic Charge Carrier Extraction and Modulation of Local Charge Density to Impact Selectivity in Plasmonic Nanometals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) metals exhibit remarkable light&#8208;absorbing property and unique catalytic activity, attracting significant attention in photocatalysts recently. However, the practical application of plasmonic nanometal is hindered by challenge of energetic electrons extraction and low selectivity. The energetic carriers generated in nanometal under illumination have extremely short lifetimes, leading to rapid energy loss. In this work, silver nanometals modified with five distinct sulfhydryl ligands (re&#8208;Ag&#8208;S&#8208;R) were synthesized via photoreduction of superlattice precursors. Modified surface efficiently extracts and preserves excited state electrons of plasmonic nanometals. By modulation the local charge density at catalytic active sites through substituents with varying electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, the selectivity of the photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction was influenced. The results demonstrated opposite selectivity between methoxy&#8208;modified re&#8208;Ag&#8208;S&#8208;OCH3 (CO selectivity of 96.73%) and amino&#8208;modified re&#8208;Ag&#8208;S&#8208;NH2 (H2 selectivity of 96.66%) despite their similar structures. The changes in excited states and surface contact potentials induced by LSPR were monitored using femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Meanwhile, the detailed discussion of the LSPR mechanism in plasmonic nanometals will serve as valuable references and foundational elements for future research in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>Gapped and Rotated Grain Boundary Revealed in Ultra&#8208;Small Au Nanoparticles for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique gapped and rotated grain boundary is discovered in Au78(TBBT)40, as the first hybrid boundary model in the gold nanoclusters. Au78(TBBT)40 exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity in the reduction of CO2 to CO compared to a series of face&#8208;centered cubic&#8208;structured nanoparticles with larger or smaller sizes, demonstrating the effectiveness of manipulating GBs to fine&#8208;tune the catalytic performance of nanoclusters.







Abstract
Although gapped grain boundaries have often been observed in bulk and nanosized materials, and their crucial roles in some physical and chemical processes have been confirmed, their acquisition at ultrasmall nanoscale presents a significant challenge. To date, they had not been reported in metal nanoparticles smaller than 2&#8197;nm owing to the difficulty in characterization and the high instability of grain boundary (GB) atoms. Herein, we have successfully developed a synthesis method for producing a novel chiral nanocluster Au78(TBBT)40 (TBBT=4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenylthiolate) with a 26&#8208;atom gapped and rotated GB. This nanocluster was precisely characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and mass spectrometry. Additionally, an offset atomic defect linked to the peripheral Au(TBBT)2 staple was found in the structure. Comparing it to similarly face&#8208;centered cubic&#8208;structured Au36(TBBT)24, Au44(TBBT)28, Au52(TBBT)32, Au92(TBBT)44, and ~5&#8197;nm nanocrystals, the bridging Au78(TBBT)40 nanocluster exhibited higher catalytic activity in the electroreduction of CO2 to CO. This enhanced activity was explained through density functional theory calculations and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, which highlight the impact of GBs and point defects on the surface properties of metal nanoclusters in balancing intermediate adsorption and product desorption.

         <title>Proton Intercalation into an Open&#8208;Tunnel Bronze Phase with Near&#8208;Zero Volume Change</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mo3Nb2O14 undergoes the near&#8208;zero volume change upon H+ (de)intercalation in aqueous batteries owing to the open tunnels that buffer the local structure change of Mo/NbOn polyhedra upon charge/discharge. The optimal molecular crowding electrolyte and the structural integrity of Mo3Nb2O14 electrode synergistically establish a highly stable electrolyte&#8208;electrode system, providing a capacity retention of approximately 100&#8201;% over 500 cycles.







Abstract
Managing safety and supply&#8208;chain risks associated with lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is an urgent task for sustainable development. Aqueous proton batteries are attractive alternatives to LIBs because using water and protons addresses these two risks. However, most host materials undergo large volume changes upon H+ intercalation, which induces intraparticle cracking to accelerates parasitic reactions. Herein, we report that Mo3Nb2O14 bronze exhibits reversible H+ intercalation (200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.7&#8201;% owing to near&#8208;zero volume change and solid&#8208;solution&#8208;type phase transition. Combination of experimental and theoretical analyses clarifies that rotation and shrinkage of open tunnels, which consist of flexible corner&#8208;sharing Mo/NbOn polyhedra, relieve local structural distortions upon H+ intercalation to suppress intraparticle cracking. The prototype full cell of an aqueous proton battery with a Mo3Nb2O14 anode operates stably over 1000 charge/discharge cycles. This study reveals the importance of implementing distortion&#8208;relieving voids in host materials to reduce volume change upon charge/discharge.

         <title>Restricting Linker Rotation in Nanocages of ZIF&#8208;8 Membranes using Crown Ether &#8220;Molecular Locks&#8221; for Enhanced Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (15C5) molecules were in&#8197;situ encapsulated within the sodalite cage of the ZIF&#8208;8 membranes to restrict their flexible pore structure. The resulting 15C5@ZIF&#8208;8 membranes exhibited exceptional C3H6/C3H8 selectivity, reaching 220, significantly surpassing most other membranes. Remarkably, as pressure increased, the separation factor continued to rise, achieving a record&#8208;high C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 331 at 7&#8197;bar.







Abstract
ZIF&#8208;8 membranes have long been prized for their exceptional C3H6/C3H8 separation performance. On the other hand, ZIF&#8208;8 has structural flexibility, where the external pressure triggers channel expansion, potentially deteriorating the molecular sieving ability. Here, we demonstrate a reliable strategy to fine&#8208;tune the flexible pore structure of ZIF&#8208;8 by embedding crown ether within a ZIF&#8208;8 membrane. Benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (15C5) was selected as the cavity occupant and perfectly confined in the sodalite (SOD) cage of ZIF&#8208;8. The 15C5 molecules, which have a size comparable to the nanocage, impose a spatial constraint on linker rotation, enabling the phase transition to a rigid structure in the flexible ZIF&#8208;8. The corresponding 15C5@ZIF&#8208;8 membranes achieve an ultrahigh C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 220, outperforming that of most membranes. Unlike their flexible counterparts, the resulting membranes manifest a positive increase in the C3H6/C3H8 separation factor with elevated pressure, securing a record&#8208;high C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 331 under 7&#8197;bar. More importantly, extraordinary separation stability was demonstrated with continuous measurement, which is highly desirable for practical applications.

         <title>Honeycomb&#8208;Structured IrOx Foam Platelets as the Building Block of Anode Catalyst Layer in PEM Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present honeycomb&#8208;structured IrOx foam platelets as an active and stable OER electrocatalyst, which enables multiscale tuning of the anodic catalyst layer from atomic to microscopic scales in PEM water electrolyzers.







Abstract
Achieving robust long&#8208;term durability with high catalytic activity at low iridium loading remains one of great challenges for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Herein, we report the low&#8208;temperature synthesis of iridium oxide foam platelets comprising edge&#8208;sharing IrO6 octahedral honeycomb framework, and demonstrate the structural advantages of this material for multilevel tuning of anodic catalyst layer across atomic&#8208;to&#8208;microscopic scales for PEMWE. The integration of IrO6 octahedral honeycomb framework, foam&#8208;like texture and platelet morphology into a single material system assures the generation and exposure of highly active and stable iridium catalytic sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while facilitating the reduction of both mass transport loss and electronic resistance of catalyst layer. As a proof of concept, the membrane electrode assembly in single&#8208;cell PEMWE based on honeycomb&#8208;structured IrOx foam platelets, with a low iridium loading (~0.3 mgIr/cm2), is demonstrated to exhibit high catalytic activity at ampere&#8208;level current densities and to remain stable for more than 2000&#8197;hours.

         <title>A Green and Efficient Electrocatalytic Route for the Highly&#8208;Selective Oxidation of C&#8722;H Bonds in Aromatics over 1D Co3O4&#8208;Based Nanoarrays</title>

         <dc:description>
The oxidation selectivities of target products can be manipulated via surface and interface engineering of Co3O4&#8208;based nanocatalysts. The selectivity toward benzaldehyde is achieved to 90&#8201;% at a 47.6&#8201;% conversion of toluene on Co3O4 NNs/Ti. In contrast, the selectivity switching to benzyl alcohol reaches 90.1&#8201;% at a 32.1&#8201;% conversion on Co3O4@MnO2/Ti, demonstrating that electrocatalytic oxidation process is readily maneuvered.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of C&#8722;H bonds in hydrocarbons represents an efficient and sustainable strategy for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals. Herein, a highly selective and continuous&#8208;flow electrochemical oxidation process of toluene to various oxygenated products (benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, and benzyl acetate) is developed with the electrocatalytic membrane electrodes (ECMEs). The selectivity of target products can be manipulated via surface and interface engineering of Co3O4&#8208;based electrocatalysts. We achieved a high benzaldehyde selectivity of 90&#8201;% at a toluene conversion of 47.6&#8201;% using 1D Co3O4 nanoneedles (NNs) loaded on a microfiltration (MF) titanium (Ti) membrane, i.e, Co3O4 NNs/Ti. In contrast, the main product shifted to benzyl alcohol with a selectivity of 90.1&#8201;% at a conversion of 32.1&#8201;% after modifying MnO2 nanosheets (NSs) on Co3O4 NNs/Ti (Co3O4@MnO2/Ti) catalyst. Moreover, benzyl acetate product can be obtained with a selectivity of 92&#8201;% at a conversion of 58.5&#8201;% at high current density (&gt;1.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), demonstrating that the pathway of toluene oxidation is readily maneuvered. DFT results reveal that modifying MnO2 on Co3O4 optimizes the electron structure of Co3O4@MnO2/Ti and modulates the adsorption behavior of intermediate species. This work demonstrates a sustainable, efficient, and continuous&#8208;flow process for precise control over the production selectivity of value&#8208;added oxygenated derivatives in the electrochemical oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Complementary Electrochromic Batteries using Nb18W16O93 by the Synergistic Effects of Aqueous Al3+/K+ Dual&#8208;Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous electrolytes containing multivalent ions have been studied extensively in post&#8208;lithium electrochromisms. This work proposes that the Wadsley&#8208;Roth phase Nb18W16O93 achieves a reversible Al3+ intercalation/extraction. Electrochromic energy storage devices based on Nb18W16O93 with Prussian blue using a hybrid Al3+/K+ aqueous electrolyte show fast response and large coloring efficiency due to the synergistic effect of Al3+ and K+.







Abstract
Multivalent ions, especially Al3+ in aqueous electrolyte contributes to higher capacity and color contrast for more sustainable post&#8208;lithium electrochromism and energy storages. However, the lack of suitable cathodic and anodic electrochromic materials is a major challenge for Al&#8208;ion electrochromic batteries, which limits their optical contrast and lifespan. Herein, we report that Wadsley&#8208;Roth phase Nb18W16O93 with open structure achieves Al3+ intercalation/extraction reversibly. The complementary electrochromic energy storage devices based on Nb18W16O93 coupled with Prussian blue using hybrid Al3+/K+ aqueous electrolytes show a fast response, a high capacity and a large coloring efficiency. The superior performances are due to the cations of Al3+ and K+ selectively insert/extract in the electrode of Nb18W16O93 and Prussian blue, respectively. This work provides an effective strategy for high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost electrochromic batteries with higher sustainability.

         <title>Mechanochemical Thioglycolate Modification of Microscale Zero&#8208;Valent Iron for Superior Heavy Metal Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dry mechanochemical process can construct more robust covalent bonding between TG and the inert oxide shell of mZVI through its electron&#8208;withdrawing carboxylate group to accelerate the electron release from the iron core, and more effectively strengthen the surface heavy metal adsorption through metal(d)&#8208;sulfur(p) orbital hybridization between its thiol group and heavy metal ions.







Abstract
Microscale zero&#8208;valent iron (mZVI) is widely used for water pollutant control and environmental remediation, yet its reactivity is still constrained by the inert oxide shell. Herein, we demonstrate that mechanochemical thioglycolate (TG) modification can dramatically enhance heavy metal (NiII, CrVI, CdII, PbII, HgII, and SbIII) removal rates of mZVI by times of 16.7 to 88.0. Compared with conventional impregnation (wet chemical process), this dry mechanochemical process could construct more robust covalent bonding between TG and the inert oxide shell of mZVI through its electron&#8208;withdrawing carboxylate group to accelerate the electron release from the iron core, and more effectively strengthen the surface heavy metal adsorption through metal(d)&#8208;sulfur(p) orbital hybridization between its thiol group and heavy metal ions. Impressively, this mechanochemically TG&#8208;modified mZVI exhibited an unprecedented NiII removal capacity of 580.4&#8197;mg&#8201;Ni&#8201;g&#8722;1 Fe, 17.1 and 9.5&#8197;times those of mZVI and wet chemically TG&#8208;modified mZVI, respectively. Its application potential was further validated by more than 10&#8197;days of stable groundwater NiII removal in a column flow reactor. This study offers a promising strategy to enhance the reactivity of mZVI, and also emphasizes the importance of the modification strategy in optimizing its performance for environmental applications.

         <title>Highly Solvating Electrolytes with Core&#8208;Shell Solvation Structure for Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core&#8211;shell solvation structured electrolyte, with phosphoramide confined in the first solvation shell via hydrogen bonding, inhibits the contact reaction with Li metal, and stabilizes the [S3]&#8901;&#8722; radical thus promoting a rapid solution&#8208;mediated sulfur reaction pathway and achieving high sulfur utilization at lean electrolyte condition. The 2.71&#8208;Ah pouch cell achieves high specific energy of 307&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and shows stable cycling over 20 cycles.







Abstract
The practical energy density of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is limited by the low sulfur utilization at lean electrolyte conditions. The highly solvating electrolytes (HSEs) promise to address the issue at harsh conditions, but the conflicting challenges of long&#8208;term stability of radical&#8208;mediated sulfur redox reactions (SRR) and the poor stability with lithium metal anode (LMA) have dimmed the efforts. We now present a unique core&#8211;shell solvation structured HSE formulated with classical ether&#8208;based solvents and phosphoramide co&#8208;solvent. The unique core&#8211;shell solvation structure features confinement of the phosphoramide in the first solvation shell, which prohibits severe contact reactions with LMA and endows prolonged stability for [S3]&#8901;&#8722; radical, favoring a rapid radical&#8208;mediated solution&#8208;based SRR. The cell with the proposed electrolyte showing a high capacity of 864&#8197;mAh&#8201;gsulfur&#8722;1 under high sulfur loading of 5.5&#8197;mgsulfur&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low E/S ratio of 4&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mgsulfur&#8722;1. The strategy further enables steady cycling of a 2.71&#8208;A h pouch cell with a high specific energy of 307&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Our work highlights the fundamental chemical concept of tuning the solvation structure to simultaneously tame the SRR and LMA stability for metal&#8208;sulfur batteries wherein the electrode reactions are heavily coupled with electrolyte chemistry.

         <title>Inverse Design of Singlet&#8208;Fission Materials with Uncertainty&#8208;Controlled Genetic Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We uncover candidates for singlet fission using a machine learning&#8208;driven uncertainty&#8208;controlled genetic algorithm (ucGA), which is run either in an exploitative or explorative manner. Leveraging a fragment database (reFORMED) derived from crystal structure data, we propose a class of heteroatom&#8208;rich mesoionic compounds as acceptors for charge&#8208;transfer mediated singlet fission.







Abstract
Singlet fission has shown potential for boosting the efficiency of solar cells, but the scarcity of suitable molecular materials hinders its implementation. We introduce an uncertainty&#8208;controlled genetic algorithm (ucGA) based on ensemble machine learning predictions from different molecular representations that concurrently optimizes excited state energies, synthesizability, and exciton size for the discovery of singlet fission materials. The ucGA allows us to efficiently explore the chemical space spanned by the reFORMED fragment database, which consists of 45,000 cores and 5,000 substituents derived from crystallographic structures assembled in the FORMED repository. Running the ucGA in an exploitative setup performs local optimization on variations of known singlet fission scaffolds, such as acenes. In an explorative mode, hitherto unknown candidates displaying excellent excited state properties for singlet fission are generated. We suggest a class of heteroatom&#8208;rich mesoionic compounds as acceptors for charge&#8208;transfer mediated singlet fission. When included in larger donor&#8208;acceptor systems, these units exhibit localization of the triplet state, favorable diradicaloid character and suitable triplet energies for exciton injection into semiconductor solar cells.

         <title>Carbodicarbene&#8208;Stibenium Ion&#8208;Mediated Functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H and C(sp)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis acidic carbodicarbene&#8208;stibenium ion mediates C(sp3)&#8722;H and C(sp)&#8722;H bond breaking of acetonitrile and terminal alkynes in the presence of an organic base. The resulting adducts were reacted with elemental iodine to functionalize these C&#8722;H bonds in stoichiometric fashion.







Abstract
Main&#8208;group element&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H activation remains experimentally challenging and the development of clear concepts and design principles has been limited by the increased reactivity of relevant complexes, especially for the heavier elements. Herein, we report that the stibenium ion [(pyCDC)Sb][NTf2]3 (1) (pyCDC=bis&#8208;pyridyl carbodicarbene; NTf2=bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) reacts with acetonitrile in the presence of the base 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine to enable C(sp3)&#8722;H bond breaking to generate the stiba&#8208;methylene nitrile complex [(pyCDC)Sb(CH2CN)][NTf2]2 (2). Kinetic analyses were performed to elucidate the rate dependence for all the substrates involved in the reaction. Computational studies suggest that C&#8722;H activation proceeds via a mechanism in which acetonitrile first coordinates to the Sb center through the nitrogen atom in a &#954;1 fashion, thereby weakening the C&#8722;H bond which can then be deprotonated by base in solution. Further, we show that 1 reacts with terminal alkynes in the presence of 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine to enable C(sp)&#8722;H bond breaking to form stiba&#8208;alkynyl adducts of the type [(pyCDC)Sb(CCR)][NTf2]2 (3&#8201;a&#8211;f). Compound 1 shows excellent specificity for the activation of the terminal C(sp)&#8722;H bond even across alkynes with diverse functionality. The resulting stiba&#8208;methylene nitrile and stiba&#8208;alkynyl adducts react with elemental iodine (I2) to produce iodoacetonitrile and iodoalkynes, while regenerating an Sb trication.

         <title>Integrated Design of Homogeneous/Heterogeneous Copper Complex Catalysts to Enable Synergistic Effects on Sulfur and Lithium Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;ETL&#8208;INT system involving homogeneous Cu&#8208;ETL and heterogeneous Cu&#8208;INT realizes the higher activity for manipulating the Li2S nucleation/decomposition, and lithium plating/stripping behaviors, endowing Li&#8722;S batteries with an outstanding capacity retention of 85.6&#8201;% at 3.0&#8197;C after 500&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Fatal polysulfide shuttling, sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and detrimental lithium dendrites have curtailed the real discharge capacity, working lifespan and safety of lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. Organic small molecule promotors as one type of emerging active catalysts can fulfil the management of the electrochemical species evolution behaviors. Herein, an integrated engineering is organized by synthesizing dual chlorine&#8208;bridge enabled binuclear copper complex (Cu2(phen)2Cl2) and its derivative generated in electrolyte (Cu&#8208;ETL) as the heterogeneous and homogeneous catalyst, respectively. The well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;ETL with a optimized concentration of 0.25&#8197;wt% as a homogeneous enabler offers highly utilized Cu centers and the sufficient interface contact for guiding the Li2S nucleation/decomposition reactions. The Cu2(phen)2Cl2 loaded on carbon spheres as an interlayer (Cu&#8208;INT) can break through the catalytic limitation resulting from the saturated concentration of Cu&#8208;ETL and thus offers an extended manipulation effect. Benefiting from the synergistic effect, the Li&#8722;S battery shows stable cycling at 3&#8197;C upon 500&#8197;cycles with a capacity degradation rate as low as 0.029&#8201;% per cycle. Of specific note, an actual cell energy density of 372.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 is harvested by a 1.2&#8197;Ah&#8208;level soft&#8208;packaged pouch cell, implying a chance for requiring the demand of high&#8208;energy batteries.

The well-designed Cu-ETL with a optimized concentration of 0.25&#8197;wt% as a homogeneous enabler offers highly utilized Cu centers and the sufficient interface contact for guiding the Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S nucleation/decomposition reactions. The Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(phen)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loaded on carbon spheres as an interlayer (Cu-INT) can break through the catalytic limitation resulting from the saturated concentration of Cu-ETL and thus offers an extended manipulation effect. Benefiting from the synergistic effect, the Li&#8722;S battery shows stable cycling at 3&#8197;C upon 500&#8197;cycles with a capacity degradation rate as low as 0.029&#8201;% per cycle. Of specific note, an actual cell energy density of 372.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is harvested by a 1.2&#8197;Ah-level soft-packaged pouch cell, implying a chance for requiring the demand of high-energy batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Sub&#8208;ppm Sensitivity in SO2 Detection with a Chemically Stable Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces the first experimental exploration of COFs for SO2 detection. The imine&#8208;functionalized COF exhibited reversible SO2 sorption with over 50 cycles of reversibility. The isosteric enthalpy of adsorption was measured at &#8722;42.3&#8197;kJ/mol, reflecting a strong SO2&#8208;COF interaction. Molecular dynamics and M&#248;ller&#8211;Plesset calculations elucidated the interaction mechanisms, underscoring the COF&#8242;s potential for selective sub&#8208;ppm SO2 sensing.







Abstract
We report the inaugural experimental investigation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to address the formidable challenge of SO2 detection. Specifically, an imine&#8208;functionalized COF (SonoCOF&#8208;9) demonstrated a modest and reversible SO2 sorption of 3.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K. At 0.1&#8197;bar (and 298&#8197;K), the total SO2 uptake reached 0.91&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 with excellent reversibility for at least 50 adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. An isosteric enthalpy of adsorption (&#916;Hads) for SO2 equaled &#8722;42.3&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, indicating a relatively strong interaction of SO2 molecules with the COF material. Also, molecular dynamics simulations and M&#248;ller&#8211;Plesset perturbation theory calculations showed the interaction of SO2 with &#960; density of the rings and lone pairs of the N atoms of SonoCOF&#8208;9. The combination of experimental data and theoretical calculations corroborated the potential use of this COF for the selective detection and sensing of SO2 at the sub&#8208;ppm level (0.0064&#8197;ppm of SO2).

         <title>Multiple Resonance Quasi&#8208;fluorescence from BN&#8208;Doped Aromatic Compounds Modified with &#8220;Naphthalene&#8221; Units Approaches the BT.2020 Green Light Standard</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing a prototypical &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon unit, specifically the naphthalene unit, into the structure of a classical blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting molecular framework, we can enhance the bonding properties of the target green emitters to meet the BT.2020 standard without sacrificing their optoelectronic performance.







Abstract
Developing fluorophores that conform to the Broadcast Service Television 2020 (BT.2020) standard presents a formidable challenge. Here, we propose an innovative approach that integrates two and three&#8208;boron/nitrogen (BN2)&#8208;embedded [4]helicene subunits with naphthalene, resulting in the synthesis of two novel narrowband bright green quasi&#8208;fluorescent emitters, NT&#8208;2B and NT&#8208;3B for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. These emitters exhibit minimal reorganization energy and Huang&#8211;Rhys factor, emitting at 510 and 511&#8197;nm in dilute toluene solution with exceptionally narrow full width at half maximum values of 15 and 14&#8197;nm, respectively. Notably, NT&#8208;2B demonstrates an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield of 92.5&#8201;%, rapid radiative decay rate, and slow non&#8208;radiative decay rate. Owing to their narrowband emission characteristics and outstanding optoelectronic properties, corresponding OLEDs based on NT&#8208;2B demonstrate a high external quantum efficiency of 30.6&#8201;%, with an FWHM value of 21.5&#8197;nm and a CIEy of 0.74, positioning it as one of the leading narrow&#8208;band green emitters.

This approach offers simple operation without inert gas protection, metals and light, rapid reaction completion within 5 minutes from the easily preparation of aryliodine (III) dicarboxylates, diverse bond formation (C&#8722;S, C&#8722;Se, C&#8722;SCF3, C&#8722;C and C&#8722;CN bonds), broad substrate scope (&gt;70 examples), and synthetic utility in late&#8208;stage functionalization, making this strategy complement classical decarboxylative strategies.







Abstract

The efficient and operationally simple approach, conducted in 5 minutes from in situ preparation of aryliodine (III) dicarboxylates under open&#8208;air and ambient conditions, enables diverse bond formation and exhibits a broad substrate scope of over 70 examples. Late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules and natural products further demonstrates the synthetic utility of this method. Combined experimental and computational studies elucidate the mechanistic pathway. These transformations streamline the synthesis of sp3 carbon&#8208;enriched compounds, adding a new dimension to classical decarboxylative reactions.

         <title>Oxyanions Enhancing Crystallinity of Reconstructed Phase for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hetero oxyanion was proposed to enhance the crystallinity and activity of reconstructed phase in operation. Taking an amorphous and crystalline (a&#8208;c) heterojunction of Ni doped Fe2O(OH)3NO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O as model, in situ NO3&#8722; leaching and reabsorbing lower the disorder degree and activate Fe (Ni) ion of renewed a&#8208;c heterojunctions, achieving the compatibility of activity and stability for OER.







Abstract
The catalysts were always undergoing continuous amorphization and dissolution of active structure in operating condition, hindering the compatibility between stability and activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we propose the selective adsorption of leached NO3&#8722; to strengthen the crystallinity and activity of surface reconstructed layer with amorphous and crystalline (a&#8208;c) heterojunction. Taking a&#8208;c Ni doped Fe2O(OH)3NO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O (Ni&#8722;FeNH) as a model precatalyst, we uncover that the leached NO3&#8722; are readily adsorbs on the crystalline phase in the formed a&#8208;c Fe(Ni)OOHduring OER, lowering the disorder degree and further activating Ni and Fe ion of the crystalline Fe(Ni)OOH on a&#8208;c heterojunctions. Accordingly, Ni&#8722;FeNH deliver a low overpotential of 303&#8197;mV and high durability of 500&#8197;hours at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for OER. Particularly, constructing industrial water electrolysis equipment exhibits high stability of 100&#8197;hours under a high operating current of 8000&#8197;mA.

Taking a-c Ni doped Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (Ni&#8722;FeNH) as a model precatalyst, we uncover that the leached NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; are readily adsorbs on the crystalline phase in the formed a-c Fe(Ni)OOHduring OER, lowering the disorder degree and further activating Ni and Fe ion of the crystalline Fe(Ni)OOH on a-c heterojunctions. Accordingly, Ni&#8722;FeNH deliver a low overpotential of 303&#8197;mV and high durability of 500&#8197;hours at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for OER. Particularly, constructing industrial water electrolysis equipment exhibits high stability of 100&#8197;hours under a high operating current of 8000&#8197;mA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ion&#8208;Pairing Chromonic Liquid Crystals via Alternately Stacked Assembly of Amphiphilic Charged &#960;&#8208;Electronic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion&#8208;pairing assemblies of an amphiphilic porphyrin AuIII complex bearing hydrophilic triethylene glycol groups exhibited the effects of counteranions and solvation at the side chains on the assembly modes. The ion pair with a &#960;&#8208;electronic anion formed charge&#8208;by&#8208;charge&#8208;based thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals and the single&#8208;stranded polymer structure via i&#960;&#8211;i&#960; interactions.







Abstract
In this study, a new assembly strategy for lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs) is proposed using i&#960;&#8211;i&#960; interactions, mainly comprising electrostatic and dispersion forces, between charged &#960;&#8208;electronic systems to form stacking structures supported by the hydration of triethylene glycol (TEG) units. The meso&#8208;TEG&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted porphyrin AuIII complex, an amphiphilic &#960;&#8208;electronic cation, showed diverse states and assembly modes in ion pairs depending on the coexisting counteranions. The PCCp&#8722; ion pair formed a hexagonal columnar (Colh) LC phase based on a charge&#8208;by&#8208;charge assembly, suggesting the formation of an ordered arrangement of charged &#960;&#8208;electronic systems through i&#960;&#8211;i&#960; interactions, with reduced interactions between the TEG chains. Furthermore, in the presence of water, LCLC behavior in the Colh and nematic columnar phases according to the amount of water were observed for the PCCp&#8722; ion pair as a result of i&#960;&#8211;i&#960; interactions. Magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced orientation of the charge&#8208;by&#8208;charge columnar structures upon dehydration was observed. Furthermore, single&#8208;stranded charge&#8208;by&#8208;charge columnar structures, as components of the LCLCs, were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

         <title>Location&#8208;Specific Microenvironment Modulation Around Single&#8208;Atom Metal Sites in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single Cu atoms are precisely anchored to Zr&#8208;oxo clusters in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with different &#8208;X (X=&#8208;NO2, &#8208;H, and &#8208;NH2) groups on the linkers. This creates ideal platforms of catalytic Cu sites surrounding with location&#8208;specific microenvironment of &#8208;X groups that play critical roles in regulating the Cu electronic structures, resulting in improved activity in the hydroboration of phenylacetylene.







Abstract
Despite coordination environment of catalytic metal sites has been recognized to be of great importance in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), a significant challenge remains in the understanding how the location&#8208;specific microenvironment in the higher coordination sphere influences their catalysis. Herein, a series of Cu&#8208;based SACs, namely Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X=&#8208;NO2, &#8208;H, and &#8208;NH2), are successfully constructed by anchoring single Cu atoms onto the Zr&#8208;oxo clusters of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), i.e., UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X. The &#8208;X functional groups dangling on the MOF linkers could be regarded as location&#8208;specific remote microenvironment to regulate electronic properties of the single Cu atoms. Remarkably, they exhibit significant differences in the catalysis toward the hydroboration of alkynes. The activity follows the order of Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NO2 &gt; Cu1/UiO&#8208;66 &gt; Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 under identical reaction conditions, where Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NO2 showcases the phenylacetylene conversion of 92&#8201;%, ~3.5 times higher efficiency than that of Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Experimental and calculation results jointly support that the Cu electronic structure is modulated by the location&#8208;specific microenvironment, thereby regulating the product desorption and promoting the catalysis.

         <title>The First&#8208;In&#8208;Class Deubiquitinase&#8208;Targeting Chimera Stabilizes and Activates cGAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first&#8208;in&#8208;class deubiquitinase&#8208;targeting chimeras (DUBTACs) of cGAS, a key component of the cGAS&#8208;STING innate immunity pathway, were discovered. These DUBTACs, which not only stabilized cGAS but also activated the cGAS&#8208;STING&#8208;IRF3 pathway, were generated by exploiting an improved small&#8208;molecule ligand of the deubiquitinase OTUB1. It has also been demonstrated that this improved OTUB1 ligand can lead to highly effective DUBTACs.







Abstract
Deubiquitinase&#8208;targeting chimera (DUBTAC) is a promising technology for inducing targeted protein stabilization (TPS). Despite its therapeutic potential, very few proteins have been stabilized by DUBTACs to date. The limited applicability of this technology is likely due to the modest DUBTAC&#8208;induced protein stabilization effect, and the scarcity of effective deubiquitinase ligands that can be harnessed for DUBTAC development. Here, we report the discovery of MS7829 and MS8588, the first&#8208;in&#8208;class DUBTACs of cGAS, a key component of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. While these DUBTACs are based on a cGAS inhibitor, they effectively stabilized cGAS and activated the cGAS/STING/IRF3 signaling. To develop these cGAS DUBTACs, we optimized EN523, an OTUB1 covalent ligand, into an improved ligand, MS5105. We validated MS5105 by generating a MS5105&#8208;based CFTR DUBTAC, which was approximately 10&#8208;fold more effective in stabilizing the &#916;F508&#8208;CFTR mutant protein than the previously reported EN523&#8208;based CFTR DUBTAC. Overall, this work advances the DUBTAC technology for TPS.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar Chiral Pillar[5]arenes via Asymmetric Sonogashira Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for the enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes via asymmetric Sonogashira coupling has been successfully developed, not only enabling the successful synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes with abundant structural and functional diversity as key building blocks for practical applications but also enriching the asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling methodologies in organic synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
As a novel type of macrocycles with attractive planar chirality, pillar[5]arenes have gained increasing research interest over the past decades, enabling their widespread applications in diverse fields such as porous materials, molecular machines, and chiral luminescence materials. However, the catalytic methodology towards the enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes remains elusive. Here we report a novel method for the enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes via asymmetric Sonogashira coupling, giving access to a wide range of highly functionalized planar chiral pillar[5]arenes, including both homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;rimmed ones, with excellent enantioselectivities. Attractively, the resultant planar chiral pillar[5]arenes show great potential for widespread use in many areas such as chiral luminescent materials. This work not only enables the successful synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes with abundant structural and functional diversity as key building blocks for practical applications but also enriches the asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling methodologies in organic synthetic chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;A novel method for the enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes via asymmetric Sonogashira coupling has been successfully developed, not only enabling the successful synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes with abundant structural and functional diversity as key building blocks for practical applications but also enriching the asymmetric cross-coupling methodologies in organic synthetic chemistry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a novel type of macrocycles with attractive planar chirality, pillar[5]arenes have gained increasing research interest over the past decades, enabling their widespread applications in diverse fields such as porous materials, molecular machines, and chiral luminescence materials. However, the catalytic methodology towards the enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes remains elusive. Here we report a novel method for the enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes via asymmetric Sonogashira coupling, giving access to a wide range of highly functionalized planar chiral pillar[5]arenes, including both homo- and hetero-rimmed ones, with excellent enantioselectivities. Attractively, the resultant planar chiral pillar[5]arenes show great potential for widespread use in many areas such as chiral luminescent materials. This work not only enables the successful synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes with abundant structural and functional diversity as key building blocks for practical applications but also enriches the asymmetric cross-coupling methodologies in organic synthetic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Tandem Catalysis for Isoindolinone Synthesis over Single&#8208;Atom Pd/TiO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel tandem catalysis for synthesizing the isoindolinone (IIO) over a single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 catalyst. The TiO2 efficiently converts phthalic anhydride (PA) with ammonia and the spillover hydrogen species activated over single&#8208;atom Pd to form IIO. Notably, NH3 serves as not only a reactant but also could accelerate the reduction of amide intermediate through the formation of a key intermediate 3&#8208;aminoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one (NH2&#8208;IIO).







Abstract
Developing an efficient strategy to replace the conventional synthesis method for producing isoindolinone (IIO) scaffold, a crucial structural motif for constructing pharmaceutical molecules, remains to be a great challenge. Herein, a single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 tandem catalysis has been developed for the IIO scaffold synthesis by using readily available phthalic anhydride (PA), ammonia, and H2. The single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic performance, achieving a PA conversion of 99&#8201;%, an IIO selectivity of 91&#8201;%, and a turnover frequency (TOF) up to 4807&#8197;h&#8722;1. This exceptional performance can be attributed to the tandem catalysis between TiO2 support and single&#8208;atom Pd. The TiO2 efficiently catalyzes the conversion of PA with ammonia to form phthalimide (PAM), subsequently transformed into IIO over TiO2 through the reaction of PAM with NH3 and the spillover hydrogen species derived from single&#8208;atom Pd. Notably, NH3 functions not only as a reactant but also as a promoter to accelerate the reduction of amides combined with the Pd/TiO2 catalyst. This tandem catalysis of a single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 catalyst provides a promising strategy for the synthesis of the crucial IIO platform molecules.

         <title>Self&#8208;Polycondensation Flux Synthesis of Ultrastable Olefin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;polycondensation flux synthesis method is developed to produce a series of olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high crystalline, porosity and stability. The COFs loading Pd nanoparticles show high NH3 production yields and faradaic efficiency, the best comprehensive performance among all reported COFs.







Abstract
Creating new functional materials that efficiently support noble metal catalysts is important and in high demand. Herein, we develop a self&#8208;polycondensation flux synthesis strategy that can produce olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) platforms with high crystallinity and porosity as the supports of Pd nanoparticles for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR). A series of &#8220;two in one&#8221; monomers integrating aldehyde and methyl reactive groups are rationally designed to afford COFs with square&#8208;shaped pores and ultrahigh chemical stability (e.g., strong acid or alkali environments for &gt;1&#8197;month). Functionalizing Fluorine significantly boosts the hydrophobicity of fluoro&#8208;functionalized COFs, which can inhibit the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and enhance ENRR performances. The COFs loading Pd nanoparticles show high NH3 production yields up to 90.0&#177;2.6&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and the faradaic efficiency of 44&#8201;% at &#8722;0.2&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, the best comprehensive performance among all reported COFs. Meanwhile, the catalysts are easy to recover and recycle, as demonstrated by their use for 15&#8197;cycles and 17&#8197;hours, with good performance retention. This work not only provides a new synthesis strategy for olefin&#8208;linked COFs, but also paves a new avenue for the design of highly efficient ENRR catalysts.

         <title>Synergistic Regulation of Anode and Cathode Interphases via an Alum Electrolyte Additive for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Vanadium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work suggests that the addition of KAl(SO4)2 induces the competitive solvation effect and forms an in situ Zn&#8722;Al alloy layer that synergistically protects the Zn anode, while the formation of an Al&#8208;containing CEI layer at the cathode inhibits the dissolution of VOx. Consequently, the Zn||VO2 full cell in the ZS&#8208;KASO electrolyte shows excellent cycling stability even at a low N/P ratio of 2.83 and high mass loading (~16&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
A zinc (Zn) metal anode paired with a vanadium oxide (VOx) cathode is a promising system for aqueous Zn&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs); however, side reactions proliferating on the Zn anode surface and the infinite dissolution of the VOx cathode destabilise the battery system. Here, we introduce a multi&#8208;functional additive into the ZnSO4 (ZS) electrolyte, KAl(SO4)2 (KASO), to synchronise the in situ construction of the protective layer on the surface of the Zn anode and the VOx cathode. Theoretical calculations and synchrotron radiation have verified that the high&#8208;valence Al3+ plays dual roles of competing with Zn2+ for solvation and forming a Zn&#8722;Al alloy layer with a homogeneous electric field on the anode surface to mitigate the side reactions and dendrite generation. The Al&#8208;containing cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface (CEI) considerably alleviates the irreversible dissolution of the VOx cathode and the accumulation of byproducts. Consequently, the Zn||Zn cell with KASO exhibits an ultra&#8208;long cycle of 6000&#8197;h at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Importantly, the VOx cathodes (VO2, V2O5 and NH4V4O10) in the ZS&#8722;KASO electrolyte showed excellent cycling stability, including Zn powder||VO2 cells and Zn||VO2 pouch cells. Even better, the full cell exhibits excellent cycling stability at low negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 2.83 and high mass loading (~16&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This study offers a straightforward and practical reference for concurrently addressing challenges at the anode and cathode of AZIBs.

         <title>Precise Synthesis of Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts through Pre&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Directed in Situ Confinement for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A genergl pre&#8208;coordination strategy is proposed to precisily synthesize the dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSACs), ranging from heteronuclear to homonuclear bimetallic pairs. Moreover, the pre&#8208;coordination strategy synthesized DSACs shows significant CO2 reduction reaction performance in both flow&#8208;cell and practical rechargeable Zn&#8208;CO2 batteries.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSACs) are the next paradigm shift in single&#8208;atom catalysts because of the enhanced performance brought about by the synergistic effects between adjacent bimetallic pairs. However, there are few methods for synthesizing DSACs with precise bimetallic structures. Herein, a pre&#8208;coordination strategy is proposed to precisely synthesize a library of DSACs. This strategy ensures the selective and effective coordination of two metals via phthalocyanines with specific coordination sites, such as &#8722;F&#8722; and &#8722;OH&#8722;. Subsequently, in situ confinement inhibits the migration of metal pairs during high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis, and obtains the DSACs with precisely constructed metal pairs. Despite changing synthetic parameters, including transition metal centers, metal pairs, and spatial geometry, the products exhibit similar atomic metal pairs dispersion properties, demonstrating the universality of the strategy. The pre&#8208;coordination strategy synthesized DSACs shows significant CO2 reduction reaction performance in both flow&#8208;cell and practical rechargeable Zn&#8208;CO2 batteries. This work not only provides new insights into the precise synthesis of DSACs, but also offers guidelines for the accelerated discovery of efficient catalysts.

Moreover, the pre-coordination strategy synthesized DSACs shows significant CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction performance in both flow-cell and practical rechargeable Zn-CO2 batteries.

         <title>Fighting Mutations with Mutations: Evolutionarily Adapting a DNA Aptamer for High&#8208;Affinity Recognition of Mutated Spike Proteins of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
MBA5SA1, a new DNA aptamer with picomolar affinity to the spike protein of diverse Omicron subvariants of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, is derived by in vitro selection for the recognition of the spike protein of BA.5 from a mutational library built on the scaffold of MSA52, an aptamer originally developed to recognize the spike protein of the wild&#8208;type virus. MBA5SA1&#8217;s affinity to the Omicron spike protein is &gt;100&#8208;fold higher than MSA52 and has set up a more reliable and sensitive clinical diagnostic tool for the Omicron variants.







Abstract
An on&#8208;going challenge with COVID&#8208;19, which has huge implications for future pandemics, is the rapid emergence of viral variants that makes diagnostic tools less accurate, calling for rapid identification of recognition elements for detecting new variants caused by mutations. We hypothesize that we can fight mutations of the viruses with mutations of existing recognition elements. We demonstrate this concept via rapidly evolving an existing DNA aptamer originally selected for the spike protein (S&#8208;protein) of wildtype SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 to enhance the interaction with the same protein of the Omicron variants. The new aptamer, MBA5SA1, has acquired 22 mutations within its 40&#8208;nucleotide core sequence and improved its binding affinity for the S&#8208;proteins of diverse Omicron subvariants by &gt;100&#8208;fold compared to its parental aptamer (improved from nanomolar to picomolar affinity). Deep sequencing analysis reveals dynamic competitions among several MBA5SA1 variants in response to increasing selection pressure imposed during in vitro selection, with MBA5SA1 being the final winner of the competition. Additionally, MBA5SA1 was implemented into an enzyme&#8208;linked aptamer binding assay (ELABA), which was applied for detecting Omicron variants in the saliva of infected patients. The assay produced a sensitivity of 86.5&#8201;% and a specificity of 100&#8201;%, which were established with 83 clinical samples.

         <title>A Crystalline Mesoionic Diazasilole Featuring Low&#8208;Valent Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the isolation of a mesoionic diazasilole featuring a low&#8208;valent silicon center that exhibits properties characteristic of both mesoionic silylene and silylone. Preliminary reactivity studies, including coordination with transition metals, oxidation, silicon atom transfer, ring saturation, ring contraction, and skeletal rearrangement, have yielded an array of novel silicon&#8208;based heterocycles.







Abstract
A 1,4,2&#8208;diazasilole containing a low&#8208;valent silicon atom has been synthesized employing a bulky imino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand. This molecular structure is characterized by a mesoionic C2N2Si five&#8208;membered ring, notable for its delocalized &#960; electrons, intrinsic charge&#8208;separated zwitterionic properties, and a distinctly nucleophilic silicon center, culminating in 6&#960; aromaticity. This compound manifests either mesoionic silylene or silylone characteristics upon coordination with transition metals. Demonstrating extraordinary versatility, this compound engages in diverse reactions such as coordination with iron or iridium, oxidation by S8, intramolecular ring saturation under the coordination influence of iridium, silicon atom transfer facilitated by Ph2Se2, ring contraction induced by Ph2Te2, and skeletal rearrangement triggered by Et3N&#8226;HCl. These reactions culminate in the formation of a variety of unprecedented silicon&#8208;based heterocycles, which are typically formidable to achieve using conventional methods. This study unveils previously unexplored facets of low&#8208;valent 1,4,2&#8208;diazasilole, positioning it as a promising foundational building block for future innovations in unique silicon compounds.

         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Cu11Ag3 nanotips with tailored local environment and tip&#8208;enhanced enrichment effect is designed for efficient electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia in wide NO3&#8722; concentrations ranging from 15 to 1800&#8197;mg&#8208;N&#8201;L&#8722;1, delivering an ultrahigh NH3 yield rate of 2.36&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.33&#8197;V vs. RHE and a high FE of 98.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (NRA) offers a sustainable approach for NH3 production and NO3&#8722; removal but suffers from low NH3 yield rate (&lt;1.20&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2). We present bimetallic Cu11Ag3 nanotips with tailored local environment, which achieve an ultrahigh NH3 yield rate of 2.36&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low applied potential of &#8722;0.33&#8197;V vs. RHE, a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.8&#8201;%, and long&#8208;term operation stability at 1800&#8197;mg&#8208;N&#8201;L&#8722;1 NO3&#8722;, outperforming most of the recently reported catalysts. At a NO3&#8722; concentration as low as 15&#8197;mg&#8208;N&#8201;L&#8722;1, it still delivers a high FE of 86.9&#8201;% and an NH3 selectivity of 93.8&#8201;%. Finite&#8208;element method and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu11Ag3 exhibits reduced adsorption energy barrier of *N intermediates, favorable water dissociation for *H generation and high energy barrier for H2 formation, while its tip&#8208;enhanced enrichment promoting NO3&#8722; accumulation.

Modular Antibody&#8208;Oligonucleotide Conjugate (MAOC) is formed with self&#8208;assembling modules each comprising a L&#8211;DNA designed to base&#8208;pair with other L&#8211;DNAs, and either single&#8208;domain antibody (sdAb) for receptor binding or ASO for mRNA targeting. The self&#8208;assembled MAOC can efficiently deliver different ASOs into the same cells via transferrin receptor (TfR1) mediated internalization for multiple exon skipping of the dystrophin gene.







Abstract
Antibody&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugate (AOC) affords preferential cell targeting and enhanced cellular uptake of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). Here, we have developed a modular AOC (MAOC) approach based on accurate self&#8208;assembly of separately prepared antibody and ASO modules. Homogeneous multimeric AOC with defined ASO&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratio were generated by L&#8211;DNA scaffold mediated precise self&#8208;assembly of antibodies and ASOs. The MAOC approach has been implemented to deliver exon skipping ASOs via transferrin receptor (TfR1) mediated internalization. We discovered an anti&#8208;TfR1 sdAb that can greatly enhance nuclear delivery of ASOs. Cryo&#8208;EM structure of the sdAb&#8208;TfR1 complex showed a new epitope that does not overlap with the binding sites of endogenous TfR1 ligands. In vivo functional analyses of MAOCs with one ASO for single exon skipping and two ASOs for double exon skipping showed that both ASO concentration and exon skipping efficacy of MAOC in cardiac and skeletal muscles are dramatically higher than conventional ASOs in the transgenic human TfR1 mouse model. MAOC treatment was well tolerated in vivo and not associated with any toxicity&#8208;related morbidity or mortality. Collectively, our data suggest that the self&#8208;assembled MAOC is a viable option for broadening the therapeutic application of ASO via multi&#8208;specific targeting and delivery.

         <title>Prompting CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol by Iron Group Metal Ion Dopants Induced Multi&#8208;sites at the Interface of SnSe/SnSe2 p&#8211;n Heterojunction</title>

Highly efficient CO2 electroreduction to ethanol is achieved via iron group metal ions doped amorphous/crystalline SnSe/SnSe2 nanorod/nanosheet hierarchical structure. Iron group metal ions doping stabilizes *CO*OH intermediate and strengthens *CO binding for further C&#8722;C coupling to eventual ethanol generation at the interface of M2+&#8208;doped SnSe/SnSe2.







Abstract
The development of non&#8208;copper&#8208;based materials for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol with high selectivity at large current density is highly desirable, but still a great challenge. Herein, we report iron group metal ions of M2+ (M=Fe, Co, or Ni)&#8208;doped amorphous/crystalline SnSe/SnSe2 nanorod/nanosheet hierarchical structures (a/c&#8208;SnSe/SnSe2) for selective CO2 electroreduction to ethanol. Iron group metal ions doping induces multiple active sites at the interface of M2+&#8208;doped SnSe/SnSe2 p&#8208;n heterojunction, which strengthens *CO intermediate binding for further C&#8722;C coupling to eventual ethanol generation. As a representative, Fe9.0%&#8208;a/c&#8208;SnSe/SnSe2 exhibits an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 62.7&#8201;% and a partial current density of 239.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V in a flow cell. Moreover, it can output an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 63.5&#8201;% and a partial current density of 201.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 24.1&#8201;% at 3.0&#8197;V in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. This work provides insight into non&#8208;Cu based catalyst design for stabilizing the key intermediates for selective ethanol production from CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Improving the Selectivity and Stability of Supported Cobalt Catalysts via Static Bi&#8208;Doping and Dynamic Trace CO2 Co&#8208;Feeding During Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed a strategy combining static and dynamic combination strategy to enhance both product selectivity and catalyst stability during propane dehydrogenation. Static Bi doping facilitates electron transfer from Bi to Co, promoting C3H8 conversion to C3H6 and mitigating undesired side reactions. CO2 acts as a dynamic decarburizing agent that efficiently inhibits coking while prolonging catalyst lifespan.







Abstract
Simultaneously enhancing selectivity and stability on supported propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report a combined static and dynamic strategy to address these issues synergistically. Firstly, we demonstrate a feasible sol&#8208;gel method for preparing atomically&#8208;dispersed Bi&#8208;decorated metal nanoparticle catalysts (MBi/Al2O3, M=Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn). In PDH testing, the total selectivity of by&#8208;products (CH4 and C2H6) significantly decreases to 4&#8201;% for CoBi catalysts due to the static Bi&#8208;doping, compared with 16&#8201;% for Co&#8208;supported catalysts. Secondly, to enhance catalytic stability, we introduce a dynamic trace CO2 co&#8208;feeding route. 10CoBi/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit superior durability against coke formation for 330&#8197;hours in PDH under a 40&#8201;% C3H8 atmosphere followed by pure C3H8 conditions at 600&#8201;&#176;C while maintaining propylene selectivity at 96&#8201;%. Notably, introducing trace CO2 leads to a remarkable 6&#8208;fold decrease in the deactivation rate constant (kd). Multiple characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that charge transfer from atomically&#8208;distributed Bi to Co nanoparticles benefits lowering the energy of C3H6 adsorption thereby suppressing by&#8208;products. Furthermore, the dynamic co&#8208;feeding of trace CO2 facilitates coke removal, suppressing catalyst deactivation. The static Bi&#8208;doping and dynamic trace CO2 co&#8208;feeding strategy contributes simultaneously to increased selectivity and stability on supported PDH catalysts.

         <title>Importing Atomic Rare&#8208;Earth Sites to Activate Lattice Oxygen of Spinel Oxides for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 catalyst was constructed to tune the lattice oxygen redox during OER, with catalytic mechanism elucidated. Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 surface follows a more favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) compared to NiCo2O4. Electron delocalization of Ce&#8197;4f states triggers charge redistribution through the Ce&#8722;O&#8722;M bridge, favoring antibonding state occupation of Ni&#8722;O in [Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Ni] unit site, thereby activating lattice oxygen redox.







Abstract
Spinel oxides have emerged as highly active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Owing to covalency competition, the OER process on spinel oxides often follows an arduous adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) pathway. Herein, we propose a novel rare&#8208;earth sites substitution strategy to tune the lattice oxygen redox of spinel oxides and bypass the AEM scaling relationship limitation. Taking NiCo2O4 as a model, the incorporation of Ce into the octahedral site induces the formation of Ce&#8722;O&#8722;M (M=Ni, Co) bridge, which triggers charge redistribution within NiCo2O4. The developed Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 exhibits remarkable OER activity with a low overpotential, satisfactory electrochemical stability, and good practicability in anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Theoretical analyses reveal that OER on Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 surface follows a more favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) pathway and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfers compared to pure NiCo2O4, as also verified by pH&#8208;dependent behavior and in situ Raman analysis. The 18O&#8208;labeled electrochemical mass spectrometry provides direct evidence that the oxygen released during the OER originates from the lattice oxygen of Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4. We discover that electron delocalization of Ce&#8197;4f states triggers charge redistribution in NiCo2O4 through the Ce&#8722;O&#8722;M bridge, favoring antibonding state occupation of Ni&#8722;O bonding in [Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Ni] unit site, thereby activating lattice oxygen redox of NiCo2O4 in OER. This work provides a new perspective for designing highly active spinel oxides for OER and offers significant insights into the rare&#8208;earth&#8208;enhanced LOM mechanism.

We discover that electron delocalization of Ce&#8197;4&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; states triggers charge redistribution in NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; through the Ce&#8722;O&#8722;M bridge, favoring antibonding state occupation of Ni&#8722;O bonding in [Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Ni] unit site, thereby activating lattice oxygen redox of NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in OER. This work provides a new perspective for designing highly active spinel oxides for OER and offers significant insights into the rare-earth-enhanced LOM mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;doped Carbon Nitrides with Visible Room&#8208;temperature Phosphorescence and Invisible Thermal&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Ultraviolet Delayed Fluorescence for Security Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of efficient solid&#8208;state fluorescence, visible room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermal&#8208;stimuli&#8208;production invisible ultraviolet (UV) delayed fluorescence (DF) is discovered by introducing oxygen relevant groups into carbon nitrides. The prepared materials exhibit great potentials in security protections by means of the thermal&#8208;stimuli quenching visible RTP and meanwhile producing invisible UV DF with superior concealment.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;mode emissive materials with stimuli&#8208;responsive producing invisible signals are very attractive for advanced security applications, but development of such materials remains highly challenging. In this work, oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nitrides (O&#8208;CNs) are prepared via microwave&#8208;assisted heating of urea, which exhibit ultraviolet (UV) solid&#8208;state fluorescence (SSFL), visible room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermal&#8208;stimuli production of invisible UV delayed fluorescence (DF) properties. Further studies confirmed that the SSFL and RTP could be attributed to the introduction of oxygen functional group (e.&#8201;g., C=O) in the skeleton of O&#8208;CNs, thus minimizing the aggregation caused quenching effect, facilitating intersystem crossing, and stabilizing the excited triplet states. The specific thermal&#8208;stimuli production of UV DF is deemed to be the relatively large energy gap between ground and excited singlet states as well as an effective triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation. Notably, the emission maximum of UV DF locates at ~310&#8197;nm with an ultra&#8208;narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) down to 19&#8197;nm, so it is completely invisible to the naked eyes, but detectable by a UV camera. To employ the unique characteristics of O&#8208;CNs, security protection strategies with superior concealment by virtue of the thermal&#8208;stimuli quenching visible RTP and meanwhile producing invisible UV DF are demonstrated.

         <title>Rational Design of Crystalline and Enantiomerically Pure Helicenes with Open&#8208;Shell Singlet Ground States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized enantiopure o&#8208;quinone functionalized helicene diradicals including dianions and neutral boron&#8208;containing species. Their singlet ground state were confirmed by experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. Notably, heteroatom boron&#8208;incorporated helicene not only shows stronger chiroptical responses in near NIR region compared to dianion salts but also displays better thermal stability.







Abstract
Helicene diradical derivatives have attracted widespread attentions because of their unique magnetic and chiroptoelectronic properties, however, crystalline and enantiomerically pure forms of helicene diradicals are extremely rare. Herein, we describe the rational design and synthesis of o&#8208;quinone functionalized helicene diradicals with crystalline enantiomerical purity. Diradical dianion salt Rac&#8208;3K and its enantiomers P/M&#8208;3K were obtained by reduction of corresponding precursors Rac&#8208;3 and P/M&#8208;3 with two equivalent potassium graphite in THF in the presence of (di)benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6. Neutral dioxoborocyclic helicene diradicals (Rac&#8208;3B and P/M&#8208;3B) were produced by reactions of Rac&#8208;3 or P/M&#8208;3 with chlorobis(perfluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)2Cl. Crystal structures of compounds Rac&#8208;3K, Rac&#8208;3B and P/M&#8208;3K were obtained by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Their open&#8208;shell singlet state ground states were confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements and theoretical calculations. Their chiroptical properties were investigated by the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy. This work provides the first examples of enantiopure helicene diradical dianions and boron&#8208;containing helicene diradicals.

         <title>Dipole Moment Modulation of Terminal Groups Enables Asymmetric Acceptors Featuring Medium Bandgap for Efficient and Stable Ternary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we present a novel design of Y&#8208;series acceptors by strategically introducing designed terminal groups that modulate dipole moments and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). By incorporating a methoxy group and a halogen atom at specific positions of the terminal groups results in asymmetric acceptors with attenuated ICT effects and broader band gaps. The optimized ternary devices exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 19.34&#8201;%.







Abstract
This study puts forth a novel terminal group design to develop medium&#8208;band gap Y&#8208;series acceptors beyond conventional side&#8208;chain engineering. We focused on the strategical integration of an electron&#8208;donating methoxy group and an electron&#8208;withdrawing halogen atom at benzene&#8208;fused terminal groups. This combination precisely modulated the dipole moment and electron density of terminal groups, effectively attenuating intramolecular charge transfer effect, and widening the band gap of acceptors. The incorporation of these terminal groups yielded two asymmetric acceptors, named BTP&#8208;2FClO and BTP&#8208;2FBrO, both of which exhibited open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) as high as 0.96&#8197;V in binary devices, representing the highest VOCs among the asymmetric Y&#8208;series small molecule acceptors. More importantly, both BTP&#8208;2FClO and BTP&#8208;2FBrO exhibit modest aggregation behaviors and molecular crystallinity, making them suitable as a third component to mitigate excess aggregation of the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9 blend and optimize the devices&#8217; morphology. As a result, the optimized BTP&#8208;2FClO&#8208;based ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.34&#8201;%, positioning it among the highest&#8208;performing OSCs. Our study highlights the molecular design importance on manipulating dipole moments and electron density in developing medium&#8208;band gap acceptors, and offers a highly efficient third component for high&#8208;performance ternary OSCs.

         <title>Unlocking Mechanism of Anion and Cation Interaction on Ion Conduction of Polymer Based Electrolyte in Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By designing polyesters with different electron withdrawing groups (EWG), it is found that strengthening the binding of EWG to anion for weakening the binding of anion to cation is the reason for fast ion conduction of polymer based electrolyte.







Abstract
Polymer based electrolyte shows advantages in compatibly improving safety and interface stability of batteries, while its limited ion conductivity and transfer number make it difficult to apply in batteries with high energy density. Herein, by designing four crosslinking polyesters with different electron withdrawing group (EWG), it is found that strengthening the binding of EWG to anion for weakening the binding of anion to Li+ is critical for high Li+ transfer number (

tLi+

 ${t_{Li}^+ }$



) and ionic conductivity of electrolyte. As a result, poly (2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl methacrylate) (PTFM) based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) shows an ionic conductivity of 0.78&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a 

tLi+

&lt;p&gt;By designing polyesters with different electron withdrawing groups (EWG), it is found that strengthening the binding of EWG to anion for weakening the binding of anion to cation is the reason for fast ion conduction of polymer based electrolyte.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymer based electrolyte shows advantages in compatibly improving safety and interface stability of batteries, while its limited ion conductivity and transfer number make it difficult to apply in batteries with high energy density. Herein, by designing four crosslinking polyesters with different electron withdrawing group (EWG), it is found that strengthening the binding of EWG to anion for weakening the binding of anion to Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is critical for high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer number (

         <dc:description>
A notable alcohol&#8208;processable n&#8208;type conductive ink was realized through favorable electrostatic interactions between poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO) and poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PEOx). Upon annealing, PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx films recrystallized and achieved conductivities over 1000&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, the highest for water/alcohol processed n&#8208;type conducting polymers. Various devices using PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx highlighted its broad potential for green organic electronics.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable conducting polymers open up a new era in organic electronics, fundamentally altering the processing methods of electronic devices. P&#8208;type conducting polymers, exemplified by aqueous solution&#8208;processed poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8201;:&#8201;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS), have been successfully commercialized. However, the performance of electron&#8208;transporting (n&#8208;type) materials remains considerably poorer. One of the primary challenges lies in striking a balance between conductivity and solvent processability. At present, most n&#8208;type conducting polymers necessitate toxic solvents for processing, which contradicts environmentally sustainable principles and impedes their potential for large&#8208;scale industrial applications. Herein, we developed an alcohol&#8208;processable high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conducting polymer, poly(3,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[1,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;b&#8217;]difuran&#8208;2,6&#8208;dione): poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx), which utilized electrostatic interactions between PEOx and PBFDO to simultaneously achieve high conductivity and alcohol&#8208;processability. The PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx films exhibited remarkable electrical conductivity exceeding 1000&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 with outstanding stability even at temperatures up to 250&#8201;&#176;C, establishing it as a prominent green solvent&#8208;processed n&#8208;type conducting polymer that rivals the most advanced p&#8208;type counterparts. Various applications including organic thermoelectric, electrochemical transistor, and electrochromic devices were showcased, highlighting the broad potential of PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx in advancing green organic electronics.

         <title>Versatile Mechanochemical Reactions Via Tailored Force Transmission in Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for modulating mechanophore reactivity is introduced by employing a cyclic pulling geometry to precisely tailor force transmission. This approach enables the construction of polymer materials with hierarchical mechanochemical responsiveness, advancing the field of polymer mechanochemistry.







Abstract
In polymer mechanochemistry, regulating the intrinsic mechanical reactivity of a mechanophore offers extensive opportunities in material science, enabling the development of hierarchical and multifunctional polymer&#8208;based materials. Recent advances have focused on innovating various types of mechanophores with inherent reactivity (e.g. regioselectivity and stereoselectivity). However, little attention has been given to modulating their reactivity by tailoring force transmission within mechanophores. Here, we introduce a novel approach through the implementation of a cyclic pulling geometry into an anthracene&#8208;maleimide (AM) mechanophore. This approach manipulates force transmission within the mechanophore and effectively regulates its reactivity from 0.0160&#8197;min&#8722;1 to 0.00133&#8197;min&#8722;1, achieving up to a 12&#8208;fold change. Mechanochemical coupling analysis indicates that the split force transmission along ring chains contributes to the significant difference in mechanochemical reactivity. By leveraging the distinct force transmission pathways within cyclic and linear AM mechanophores, we covalently integrate them with a spiropyran mechanophore to design tandem mechanophore systems for hierarchical mechanochemical activation. These findings highlight the efficacy and versatility of the cyclic pulling strategy in modulating mechanophore reactivity, providing valuable insights for the design of tunable multifunctional polymer&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Strong Magneto&#8208;Chiroptical Effects through Introducing Chiral Transition&#8208;Metal Complex Cations to Lead Halide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral metal halide based on A&#8208;site chiral complex cation is synthesized, which provides a new strategy to construct the magnetic chiral metal halide. The influence of complex cation on the chiroptical and magnetic properties is systematically investigated. An ultrahigh modulation of over 500&#8201;% of apparent circular dichroism is achieved under 1.3&#8197;T magnetic field. The coupling between magnetic moment and chiroptical activity is confirmed by the magneto&#8208;chiral dichroism.







Abstract
The interplay between chirality with magnetism can break both the space and time inversion symmetry and have wide applications in information storage, photodetectors, multiferroics and spintronics. Herein, we report the chiral transition&#8208;metal complex cation&#8208;based lead halide, R&#8208;CDPB and S&#8208;CDPB. In contrast with the traditional chiral metal halides with organic cations, a novel strategy for chirality transfer from the transition&#8208;metal complex cation to the lead halide framework is developed. The chiral complex cations directly participate the band structure and introduce the d&#8208;d transitions and tunable magneto&#8208;chiroptical effects in both the ultraviolet and full visible range into R&#8208;CDPB and S&#8208;CDPB. Most importantly, the coupling between magnetic moment of the complex cation and chiroptical properties is confirmed by the magneto&#8208;chiral dichroism. For the band&#8208;edge transition, the unprecedented modulation of +514&#8201;% for S&#8208;CDPB and &#8722;474&#8201;% for R&#8208;CDPB was achieved at &#8722;1.3 Tesla. Our findings demonstrate a novel strategy to combine chirality with magnetic moment, and provide a versatile material platform towards magneto&#8208;chiroptical and chiro&#8208;spintronic applications.

         <title>Towards Efficient White&#8208;light Emission in Sulfur Dots through Surface Charge Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
White&#8208;light emission with a photoluminescence quantum yield of up to 12.1&#8201;% has been achieved in sulfur dots (SDs) for the first time through surface charge engineering. Detailed experimental and theoretical analyses indicate that the orbital coupling between sulfur and oleylamine molecules facilitates charge transfer (CT) transitions at the hybrid surface of SDs. This CT interaction complicates the transition dynamics and promotes multi&#8208;energy emission.







Abstract
Sulfur dots (SDs) have emerged as promising photoluminescence (PL) materials owing to their intrinsic merits such as abundant electronic effects, outstanding biocompatibility and available photocatalytic activity. Typically based on quantum confinement effects, SDs are reported usually confined emission in blue&#8208;to&#8208;green region. However, it is challenging to achieve their broad emission tunability in the visible region, restricted by inherent band gap of bulk sulfur (ca. 2.79&#8197;eV). Herein, we present white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting SDs achieved by surface charge engineering that hybridizes the surface of SDs with oleylamine. The resulting SDs exhibit broadband emissions (full width at half maximum of 187&#8197;nm) with PL quantum yields of up to 12.1&#8201;% and Commission International de I'Eclairage color coordinates of (0.27, 0.32).

     alt="Towards Efficient White-light Emission in Sulfur Dots through Surface Charge Engineering"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White-light emission with a photoluminescence quantum yield of up to 12.1&#8201;% has been achieved in sulfur dots (SDs) for the first time through surface charge engineering. Detailed experimental and theoretical analyses indicate that the orbital coupling between sulfur and oleylamine molecules facilitates charge transfer (CT) transitions at the hybrid surface of SDs. This CT interaction complicates the transition dynamics and promotes multi-energy emission.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfur dots (SDs) have emerged as promising photoluminescence (PL) materials owing to their intrinsic merits such as abundant electronic effects, outstanding biocompatibility and available photocatalytic activity. Typically based on quantum confinement effects, SDs are reported usually confined emission in blue-to-green region. However, it is challenging to achieve their broad emission tunability in the visible region, restricted by inherent band gap of bulk sulfur (ca. 2.79&#8197;eV). Herein, we present white-light-emitting SDs achieved by surface charge engineering that hybridizes the surface of SDs with oleylamine. The resulting SDs exhibit broadband emissions (full width at half maximum of 187&#8197;nm) with PL quantum yields of up to 12.1&#8201;% and Commission International de I'Eclairage color coordinates of (0.27, 0.32). Detailed experimental and theoretical analysis reveal that the strong orbital coupling between oleylamine and sulfur on the hybrid surfaces of the SDs causes electron delocalization, leading to the generation of low-energy charge transfer (CT) states. These CT states are highly sensitive to sulfur-oleylamine hybrid structures, which complicate the transition dynamics and promote multi-energy emissions, accounting for efficient white-light emission. The demonstration of white-light SDs based on surface charge engineering is an important step towards the development of sulfur-based PL materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust and Reversible Thermal/Electro&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Polymeric Adhesives via Synergistic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonds and Ionic Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orthogonal yet synergistic effect of H&#8722;bonding DAP/Thy moieties with poly(ionic liquid)s towards the robust and reversible thermal/electro&#8208;responsive polymeric adhesives has been addressed. The incorporated ionic segments can partly mitigate intermolecular DAP/Thy H&#8722;bonding interactions within cohesion network, thereby liberate more free H&#8722;bonds towards the substrate interface, endowing the promoted interfacial adhesion forces.







Abstract
Adhesive conducting elastomers are rising materials towards cutting&#8208;edge applications in wearable and implantable soft electronics. Yet, engineering the conductive adhesives with robust and tunable interfacial bonding strength is still in its infancy stage. We herein identify a structurally novel supramolecular polymer scaffold, characterized by synergistic coexistence of hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8722;bonding) interactions and electrostatic ionic junctions, endowing the robust and tunable elastic conducting adhesives with remarkable thermal/electro&#8208;responsive performance. H&#8722;bonding association and electrostatic interaction play orthogonal yet synergistic roles in the strong supramolecular adhesive formation, serving as the leveraging forces for opposing both cohesion and adhesion energy. To do so, six&#8208;arm star&#8208;shaped random copolymers P1, and P2 are strategically designed, bearing H&#8722;bonding PDAP (poly(diaminopyridine acrylamide)) and PThy (poly(thymine)) segments, which can form hetero&#8208;complementary DAP/Thy H&#8722;bonding association, along with ionic conductive poly(ionic liquid)s segment: PMBT, (poly(1&#8208;[2&#8208;methacryloylethyl]&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethane)&#8208;sulfonamide)). DAP/Thy H&#8722;bonding association, along with electrostatic ionic interaction, can yield dual supramolecular forces crosslinked polymeric networks with robust cohesion energy. Moreover, coexistence of poly(ionic liquid)s can impact and interfere the configuration of H&#8722;bonding association, liberate more free DAP and Thy motifs to form H&#8722;bonds towards substrate, affording strong surface adhesion in a synergistic manner. This work demonstrates a significant forward step towards potential adhesives devoted to hybrid electronic devices.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Sequence&#8208;Controlled Copolymerization of Lactones: Tailoring Material Properties from Robust Plastics to Tough Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>

This study presents a solvent&#8208;dependent sequence&#8208;controlled copolymerization strategy for creating block and statistical copolyesters from 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;3&#8208;one (4Ph&#8208;BL) and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (&#1013;&#8208;CL). It explores how the distinct kinetics of these monomers, affected by coordinating versus non&#8208;coordinating solvents, lead to tunable copolyester properties, ranging from robust plastics to tough elastomers.







Abstract
Copolymerization stands as a versatile and potent method for tailoring polymer properties by adjusting structural unit composition and sequence distribution. However, achieving sequence&#8208;controlled copolymerization in a one&#8208;step and one&#8208;pot process remains challenging. This study introduces a solvent&#8208;dependent sequence&#8208;controlled copolymerization strategy to produce block and statistical copolyesters from 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;3&#8208;one (4Ph&#8208;BL) and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (&#1013;&#8208;CL). The distinct kinetics of the two monomers enable the facile synthesis of diblock and triblock copolyesters, PCL&#8208;b&#8208;P(4Ph&#8208;BL) and P(4Ph&#8208;BL)&#8208;b&#8208;PCL&#8208;b&#8208;P(4Ph&#8208;BL), in non&#8208;coordinating solvents, such as dichloromethane and toluene. Conversely, coordinating solvents like tetrahydrofuran, 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran, 2,5&#8208;dimethyltetrahydrofuran, 1,4&#8208;dioxane, and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane facilitate frequent transesterifications, yielding statistical copolyesters P[CL&#8208;stat&#8208;(4Ph&#8208;BL)] with varying ratios of heterosequences. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that coordinating solvents stabilize the transition state for transesterification, thereby validating their role in triggering this process. By varying the microstructures and compositions, the resultant copolyesters display tunable thermal and mechanical properties, evolving from robust plastics with an ultimate tensile strength of up to 46.3&#177;3.1&#8197;MPa to tough elastomers with &gt;99.3&#8201;% elastic recovery. All the copolyesters exhibit remarkable thermal stability (Td,5%=376&#8201;&#176;C) and maintain desirable chemical circularity (&gt;92&#8201;%), supporting a closed&#8208;loop life cycle for sustainable material economy.

Piperazine&#8208;based bisphosphonate&#8208;linked ionizable lipids for enhanced lipid nanoparticle (LNP)&#8208;mediated messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery to the bone microenvironment through systemic administration.







Abstract
Nucleic acid delivery with mRNA lipid nanoparticles are being developed for targeting a wide array of tissues and cell types. However, targeted delivery to the bone microenvironment remains a significant challenge in the field, due in part to low local blood flow and poor interactions between drug carriers and bone material. Here we report bone&#8208;targeting ionizable lipids incorporating a piperazine backbone and bisphosphate moieties, which bind tightly with hydroxyapatite ([Ca5(PO4)3OH]), a key component of mineralized tissues. These lipids demonstrate biocompatibility and low toxicity in both vitro and in vivo studies. LNP formulated with these lipids facilitated efficient cellular transfection and improved binding to hydroxyapatite in vitro, and targeted delivery to the bone microenvironment in vivo following systemic administration. Overall, our findings demonstrate the critical role of the piperazine backbone in a novel ionizable lipid, which incorporates a bisphosphonate group to enable efficient bone&#8208;targeted delivery, highlighting the potential of rational design of ionizable lipids for next&#8208;generation bone&#8208;targeting delivery systems.

         <title>Electrostatically Dominated Pre&#8208;Organization in Cyclodextrin Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic interactions have been found to dominate the pre&#8208;organization of carboxylate anionic guests inside the tunnels of cyclodextrin metal&#8208;organic frameworks. These interactions are so strong that they override the influence of all other noncovalent bonding interactions present in the tunnels.







Abstract
Electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged entities play a key role in pre&#8208;organizing substrates and stabilizing transition states of reactions in enzymes. The use of electrostatic interactions to pre&#8208;organize ions in nanoconfined pores, however, has not been investigated to its full potential. Herein, we describe how carboxylate anions can be pre&#8208;organized at the behest of their electrostatic interactions with K+ cations in nanoconfined tunnels present in &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal&#8211;organic frameworks, i.e., CD&#8208;MOFs. Several carboxylate anions, which are all much smaller than the cavities of the tunnels, were visualized by X&#8208;ray crystallography when nanoconfined in CD&#8208;MOFs, despite the large voids present in the tunnels. These anions were found to be aligned within a planar array defined by four K+ cations, positioned around the periphery of the tunnels. The strong electrostatic interactions between the carboxylate anions and the K+ cations dictate the orientation of the anions and override the influence of all other possible noncovalent bonding interactions between them and the tunnels. Consequently, the aligned pairs of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin rings constituting the tunnels become distorted, resulting in them having lower symmetry and fewer disordered carboxylate anions in the solid state.

     alt="Electrostatically Dominated Pre-Organization in Cyclodextrin Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrostatic interactions have been found to dominate the pre-organization of carboxylate anionic guests inside the tunnels of cyclodextrin metal-organic frameworks. These interactions are so strong that they override the influence of all other noncovalent bonding interactions present in the tunnels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged entities play a key role in pre-organizing substrates and stabilizing transition states of reactions in enzymes. The use of electrostatic interactions to pre-organize ions in nanoconfined pores, however, has not been investigated to its full potential. Herein, we describe how carboxylate anions can be pre-organized at the behest of their electrostatic interactions with K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations in nanoconfined tunnels present in &#947;-cyclodextrin metal&#8211;organic frameworks, i.e., CD-MOFs. Several carboxylate anions, which are all much smaller than the cavities of the tunnels, were visualized by X-ray crystallography when nanoconfined in CD-MOFs, despite the large voids present in the tunnels. These anions were found to be aligned within a planar array defined by four K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations, positioned around the periphery of the tunnels. The strong electrostatic interactions between the carboxylate anions and the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations dictate the orientation of the anions and override the influence of all other possible noncovalent bonding interactions between them and the tunnels. Consequently, the aligned pairs of &#947;-cyclodextrin rings constituting the tunnels become distorted, resulting in them having lower symmetry and fewer disordered carboxylate anions in the solid state. Our findings offer a transformative strategy for controlling the packing and orientation of ions in nanoconfined environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Direct Chemical Repair of Etheno&#8208;Type RNA Damages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study identifies PS9, a synthetic flavin derivative, as the first chemical repair agent for etheno&#8208;type RNA damages. PS9 effectively removes &#1013;A and &#1013;C modifications in RNA via cycloaddition with singlet oxygen under blue light, presenting a novel approach distinct from traditional protein&#8208;mediated repair. This discovery highlights potential applications in understanding RNA damage repair and its implications for RNA biology and therapeutic development.







Abstract
Etheno damages in RNA represent a unique class of structural alterations that arise from exposure to various environmental stressors or endogenous processes. They significantly distort the RNA structure and affect crucial biological functions, including RNA&#8208;protein interactions, ribosome function, and translation fidelity. However, repair mechanisms for those etheno damages in RNA are still being elucidated. Here, a synthetic flavin derivative PS9 has been identified as the first example of chemical repair approach for this type of RNA damages. It efficiently managed the removal of etheno&#8208;type &#1013;A and &#1013;C damages in nucleosides, oligonucleotides in vitro, and in E. coli RNA in vivo under blue light irradiation. The capacity of the chemical approach relies on a unique cycloaddition activation of the etheno&#8208;bridge with singlet oxygen, which is distinct from traditional epoxidation of the C=C double bonds by proteins from the AlkB family. The understanding and effective manipulation of etheno damages in RNA with chemical tools hold implications for deciphering their role in mutagenesis and RNA biology, potentially opening avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions and biomarker development.

         <title>Strengthen Water O&#8722;H Bond in Electrolytes for Enhanced Reversibility and Safety in Aqueous Aluminum Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrated that the water activity of AAIBs can be effectively suppressed by elevating the electron density of water protons through interactions with exceptionally polar additives. Simultaneously, this strategic approach alleviates aluminum corrosion in the hybrid electrolyte, widens the electrochemical stability window of the electrolyte, and effectively resolves the flammability issue associated with organic additives.







Abstract
Aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries present a promising prospect for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications, owing to the abundance, inherent safety, and the high theoretical capacity of aluminum. However, their voltage output and energy density are significantly hindered by challenges such as complex hydrogen evolution and uncontrollable solvation reactions. In this work, we demonstrate that water decomposition is restrain by increasing the electron density of water protons and increasing the dissociation energy of H2O through robust dipole interactions with highly polar dimethylformamide (DMF) molecules. Moreover, the incorporation of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) flame retardant effectively addresses the flammability risk arising from a substantial presence of organic additives The in&#8208;depth study with experimental and theoretical simulations reveals that the water&#8208;poor solvation structure with reduced water activity is achieved, which can (i) effectively mitigate undesired solvated H2O&#8208;mediated side reactions on the Al anode; (ii) boost the de&#8208;solvation kinetics of Al3+ while preventing cathode structural distortion; (iii) reduce the flammability of hybrid electrolytes. As a proof of concept, the Al//AlxMnO2 full cell employing a hybrid electrolyte demonstrate enhanced stability (deliver 335&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 while retaining 71&#8201;% capacity for 400 cycles) compared to those with pure electrolyte.

         <title>Efficient Electrosynthesis of Valuable para&#8208;Benzoquinone from Aqueous Phenol on NiRu Hybrid Catalysts</title>

The NiRu hybrid electrocatalyst with enhanced phenol adsorption, increased para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) desorption, and suppressed oxygen evolution capabilities, simultaneously achieves excellent phenol abatement and valuable p&#8208;BQ production at ambient conditions.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of aqueous phenol to para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) offers a sustainable approach for both pollutant abatement and value&#8208;added chemicals production. However, achieving high phenol conversion and p&#8208;BQ yield under neutral conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported Ru nanoparticles (NiRu) hybrid electrocatalyst, which exhibits a superior phenol conversion of 96.5&#8201;% and an excellent p&#8208;BQ yield of 83.4&#8201;% at pH&#8197;7.0, significantly outperforming previously reported electrocatalysts. This exceptional performance benefits from the triple synergistic modulation of the NiRu catalyst, including enhanced phenol adsorption, increased p&#8208;BQ desorption, and suppressed oxygen evolution. By coupling a flow electrolyzer with an extraction&#8208;distillation separation unit, the simultaneous phenol removal and p&#8208;BQ recovery are realized. Additionally, the developed electrocatalytic system with the NiRu/C anode displays good stability, favorable energy consumption, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions for phenol&#8208;containing wastewater treatment, demonstrating its potential for practical applications. This work offers a promising strategy for achieving low&#8208;carbon emissions in phenol wastewater treatment.

         <title>Establishing the Comprehensive Structure&#8722;Activity Relationship of the Natural Antibiotic Kibdelomycin/Amycolamicin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through extensive chemical synthesis, the first comprehensive structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) analysis of the potent natural antibiotics kibdelomycin (KBD) and amycolamicin (AMM) was established in this study. A key analog with enhanced antibacterial properties was identified, offering valuable insights for the development of novel antibiotics based on KBD/AMM to combat the pressing global challenge of antimicrobial resistance.







Abstract
Kibdelomycin (KBD) and amycolamicin (AMM) are potent natural antibiotics effective against antibiotic&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, including vancomycin&#8208;intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, VISA), methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and quinolone&#8208;resistant S. aureus (QRSA). Their antibacterial activity stems from an unprecedented dual mechanism: the lower binding sites occupy the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding pocket of bacterial type II topoisomerases, while the upper binding sites disrupt the enzyme dimer interface. This dual action, combined with their unique chemical structures, positions KBD and AMM as promising scaffolds for developing new antibiotics. However, the structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) of KBD/AMM remains underexplored due to their highly complex chemical structures. In this study, we utilized total synthesis to produce KBD/AMM analogs with various site modifications and evaluated their antimicrobial activities. Our findings establish the first comprehensive SAR for KBD/AMM, paving the way for the development of novel KBD/AMM&#8208;based antibiotics.

A cross&#8208;linked film, QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50, based on a quinoidal compound and polyethylenimine has been developed. This film exhibits high electrical conductivity and exceptional stretchability. When utilized as the electron transport layer in inverted organic solar cells (OSCs), it achieved a power conversion efficiency of 18.27&#8201;% with impressive stability. Additionally, fully stretchable inverted OSCs fabricated with QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50 demonstrated a PCE of 14.01&#8201;%.







Abstract
The photocatalytic activity and inherent brittleness of ZnO, which is commonly used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted organic solar cells (OSCs), have impeded advancements in device stability and the development of fully stretchable OSCs. In this study, an intrinsically stretchable ETL for inverted OSCs through a side&#8208;chain cross&#8208;linking strategy has been developed. Specifically, cross&#8208;linking between bromine atoms on the side chains of a quinoidal compound and the amino groups in polyethylenimine resulted in a film, designated QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50, with high electrical conductivity (0.049 S/m) and excellent stretchability (crack&#8208;onset strain&gt;45&#8201;%). When used as the ETL in inverted OSCs, QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50 was markedly superior to ZnO in terms of device performance and stability, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.27&#8201;% and a T80 lifetime exceeding 10000&#8197;h. Moreover, incorporation of QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50 in fully stretchable inverted OSCs yielded a PCE of 14.01&#8201;%, and 80&#8201;% of the initial PCE was maintained after 21&#8201;% strain, showcasing its potential for wearable electronics.

         <title>Scalable Electro&#8208;Biosynthesis of Ectoine from Greenhouse Gases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electro&#8208;biocatalytic hybrid system is created for upcycling CO2 into a valuable C6 product (ectoine) by integrating an artificial nanostructured copper catalyst and genetically engineered methanotrophic bacteria powered by electricity. This work innovatively demonstrated the feasibility of merging electrochemical reactions with microbial processes for a promising CO2&#8208;based industrial biomanufacturing paradigm.







Abstract
Converting greenhouse gases into valuable products has become a promising approach for achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral economy and sustainable development. However, the conversion efficiency depends on the energy yield of the substrate. In this study, we developed an electro&#8208;biocatalytic system by integrating electrochemical and microbial processes to upcycle CO2 into a valuable product (ectoine) using renewable energy. This system initiates the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane, an energy&#8208;dense molecule, which then serves as an electrofuel to energize the growth of an engineered methanotrophic cell factory for ectoine biosynthesis. The scalability of this system was demonstrated using an array of ten 25&#8197;cm2 electrochemical cells equipped with a high&#8208;performance carbon&#8208;supported isolated copper catalyst. The system consistently generated methane at the cathode under a total partial current of approximately &#8722;37&#8197;A (~175&#8197;mmolCH4&#8201;h&#8722;1) and O2 at the anode under a total partial current of approximately 62&#8197;A (~583&#8197;mmolO2&#8201;h&#8722;1). This output met the requirements of a 3&#8208;L bioreactor, even at maximum CH4 and O2 consumption, resulting in the high&#8208;yield conversion of CO2 to ectoine (1146.9&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1). This work underscores the potential of electrifying the biosynthesis of valuable products from CO2, providing a sustainable avenue for biomanufacturing and energy storage.

         <title>Hydroxyl&#8208;Binding Induced Hydrogen Bond Network Connectivity on Ru&#8208;based Catalysts for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metastable Ru&#8208;based catalysts with regulated adsorption strength of hydroxyl species were synthesized for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). We unveil that the hydroxyl intermediates adsorbed on the electrode surface are responsible for the increased connectivity of hydrogen bond networks in the EDL region, and the enhanced alkaline HOR performance.







Abstract
Understanding the role of adsorbed intermediates at the polarized catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface on the structure of electrical double layer (EDL) is essential for developing highly efficient electrocatalysts. Here, we prepared a series of unconventional face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) phase Ru&#8208;based catalysts (i.e. fcc&#8208;Ru, fcc&#8208;RuCr, and fcc&#8208;RuCrW) by rational tuning the binding energetics of hydroxyl intermediate to engineer the electrochemical interface and boost the performance of alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The introduction of oxyphilic metals Cr and W can regulate the orbital occupation of Ru, promote the adsorption of hydroxyl species, resulting in an anomalous behavior that HOR performance under alkaline media exceeds acidic media. Experimental results and theoretical calculations unravel that the modulated adsorption of hydroxyl species on the electrode surface are responsible for the reconstruction of interfacial water structure and dynamic evolution of free water molecules from nearest to the electrode surface to above the gap region in the EDL, thereby leading to significantly increased water connectivity and hydrogen bond network. Our work reveals a new understanding of the surface intermediates in controlling the dynamic process of interfacial water and hydrogen bonding network in HOR electrocatalysis, and will guide rational design of advanced electrocatalysts through electrochemical interfacial engineering.

An innovative crystal modulation strategy was proposed and implemented on a Mn&#8208;based cathode Na0.72Li0.24Mn0.76O2 with highly exposed {010} active facets and reinforced Mn&#8722;O bond, facilitating enduring anionic redox activity with fast kinetics. The robust structural stability and zero&#8208;strain behavior with ultra&#8208;low volume variation (0.1&#8197;C: 1.75&#8201;%, 1&#8197;C: 0.31&#8201;%, 5&#8197;C: 0.04&#8201;%) are directly revealed via advanced nondestructive time&#8208;resolved operando 2D&#8208;XRD.







Abstract
Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with anionic redox reactions hold great potential for energy storage applications due to their ultra&#8208;high capacity and cost effectiveness. However, achieving high capacity requires overcoming challenges such as oxygen&#8208;redox failure, sluggish kinetics, and structural degradation. Herein, we employ an innovative crystal modulation strategy, using Mn&#8208;based Na0.72Li0.24Mn0.76O2 as a representative cathode material, which shows that the highly exposed {010} active facets enable an enhanced rate capability (119.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;C) with fast kinetics. Meanwhile, the reinforced Mn&#8722;O bond inhibits excessive oxidation of lattice oxygen and O&#8722;O cohesion loss, stabilizing and maintaining a long&#8208;enduring reversible oxygen&#8208;redox activity (100&#8201;% high capacity retention after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C and 84.28&#8201;% retention after 300&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C). Time&#8208;resolved operando two&#8208;dimensional X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals the robust structural stability, zero&#8208;strain behavior, and suppressed phase transition with ultra&#8208;low volume variation during cycling at different rates (0.1&#8197;C: 1.75&#8201;%, 1&#8197;C: 0.31&#8201;%, 5&#8197;C: 0.04&#8201;%). Additionally, the full cell coupled with hard carbon achieves a high energy density of approximately 211&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with superior performance. This work highlights the significance of crystal modulation and presents a universal approach in developing Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes with stable anionic redox for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Regulated Mechanochemical Synthesis of Covalent Organic Frameworks: Cocrystal Precursor Strategy for Confined Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cocrystal precursor template strategy employs confined assembly for the synthesis of 2D&#8208;imine&#8208;COFs using N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O supramolecular synthons in a mechanochemical one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step process. This strategy leverages the directionality of the helical hydrogen bonding network and the protonation transfer of amine monomers to facilitate the ordered stacking and confined assembly necessary for imine COF formation.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional imine covalent organic frameworks (2D imine&#8208;COFs) are crystalline porous materials with broad application prospects. Despite the efforts into their design and synthesis, the mechanisms of their formation are still not fully understood. Herein, a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step mechanochemical cocrystal precursor synthetic strategy is developed for efficient construction of 2D imine&#8208;COFs. The mechanistic investigation demonstrated that the cocrystal precursors of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)trianiline (TAPT) and p&#8208;toluenesulphonic acid (PTSA) sufficiently regulate the crystalline structure of COF. Evidenced by characterizations and theoretical studies, a helical hydrogen&#8208;bond network was constructed by the N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O supramolecular synthons between amino and sulfonic groups in TAPT&#8208;PTSA, demonstrating the role of cocrystals in promoting the organized stacking of interlayer &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, layer arrangement, and interlayer spacing, thus facilitating the orderly assembly of COFs. Moreover, the protonation degree of TAPT amines, which tuned nucleophilic directionality, enabled the sequential progression of intra&#8208; and interlayer imine condensation reactions, inhibiting the formation of amorphous polymers. The transformation from cocrystal precursors to COFs was achieved through comprehensive control of hydrogen bond and covalent bond sites. This work significantly advances the concept of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;regulated COF assembly and its mechanochemical method in the design and synthesis of 2D imine&#8208;COFs, further elucidating the mechanistic aspects of their mechanochemical synthesis.

         <title>Switching Sides: Regiochemistry and Functionalization Dictate the Photoswitching Properties of Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
You know what imine? Aryliminopyrazoles have demonstrated their suitability as photoswitches and in driving dynamic&#8208;covalent reactions out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium. However, the influence of their structure on their photoswitching properties remains unknown. Here, we present the first comprehensive investigation into their structure&#8211;property relationship, a detailed list of design rules, and their ability to switch in the condensed phase.







Abstract
Photoswitchable imines demonstrate light&#8208;dependent dynamic covalent chemistry and can function as molecular ratchets. However, the design of aryliminopyrazoles (AIPs) has been limited to N&#8208;pyrazole derivatives with ortho&#8208;pyrrolidine motifs. The impact of other functionalization patterns on the photoswitching properties remains unknown. Here, we present a systematic structure&#8208;property analysis and study how the photoswitching properties can be tuned through ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;functionalization of the phenyl ring in N&#8208;pyrazole and N&#8208;phenyl AIPs. This study establishes the first set of design rules for these AIP photoswitches and reports the most stable Z&#8208;isomer of an AIP to date, enabling its crystallization and resulting in the first reported crystal structure of a metastable Z&#8208;aldimine. Finally, we demonstrate that the AIPs are promising candidates for photoswitching in the condensed phase.

         <title>Electrolyte Design Enables Stable and Energy&#8208;Dense Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through electrolyte design to simultaneously increase the Coulombic efficiency on the graphite anode side and enhance the oxidation stability on the 4.4&#8197;V (vs. K+/K) Prussian blue analogue cathode side, stable, low&#8208;cost, and energy&#8208;dense PIBs can be realized with specific energy and cycling stability comparable to the contemporary LiFePO4&#8208;based LIBs and superior to emerging SIBs.







Abstract
Free from strategically important elements such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper, potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are heralded as promising low&#8208;cost and sustainable electrochemical energy storage systems that complement the existing lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the reported electrochemical performance of PIBs is still suboptimal, especially under practically relevant battery manufacturing conditions. The primary challenge stems from the lack of electrolytes capable of concurrently supporting both the low&#8208;voltage anode and high&#8208;voltage cathode with satisfactory Coulombic efficiency (CE) and cycling stability. Herein, we report a promising electrolyte that facilitates the commercially mature graphite anode (&gt;3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) to achieve an initial CE of 91.14&#8201;% (with an average cycling CE around 99.94&#8201;%), fast redox kinetics, and negligible capacity fading for hundreds of cycles. Meanwhile, the electrolyte also demonstrates good compatibility with the 4.4&#8197;V (vs. K+/K) high&#8208;voltage K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] (KMF) cathode. Consequently, the KMF||graphite full&#8208;cell without precycling treatment of both electrodes can provide an average discharge voltage of 3.61&#8197;V with a specific energy of 316.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1&#8722;(KMF+graphite), comparable to the LiFePO4||graphite LIBs, and maintain 71.01&#8201;% capacity retention after 2000&#8197;cycles.

MnWO4/FeCoNi Mott&#8208;Schottky heterostructure allows photogenerated electrons to directly participate in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and photogenerated holes to promote rapid reconstruction of Ni(FeCo)OOH/MnOOH species for oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

Abstract
The development of bifunctional photogenerated carrier&#8208;assisted electrocatalytic (PCA&#8208;EC) electrodes that operate with stability at large current&#8208;density remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a simple sputtering&#8208;deposition process to synthesize a novel MnWO4/FeCoNi Mott&#8208;Schottky heterojunction coating and deposit it on a pure Ti substrate to prepare high&#8208;performance PCA&#8208;EC electrodes, which exhibits enhanced light absorption range/intensity and rapidly separated photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. This design allows photogenerated electrons to directly participate in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while the strong oxidation of photogenerated holes significantly reduces the defect formation energy of active metals, thereby facilitating the rapid reconstruction of highly active Ni(FeCo)OOH/MnOOH species for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As expected, the as&#8208;prepared electrode demonstrates the overpotentials of 64&#8197;mV for the HER and 204&#8197;mV for the OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under illumination. Benefiting from the stable interface with Fe/Co/Ni&#8208;O&#8722;Mn/W bonding units, the dual&#8208;electrode photoassisted electrolytic cell achieves long&#8208;term stability at current densities of 500 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides detailed insights into the enhancement mechanism of PCA&#8208;EC and contributes to the development of photo&#8208;assisted water splitting electrodes for large current&#8208;density applications.

Functional group translocation: we disclose that an unprecedented di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;ethane rearrangement featuring 1,4&#8208;aryl migration facilitated by energy transfer catalysis under visible light conditions. The open&#8208;shell strategy has been applied in the modification of several drugs. Large&#8208;scale experiments, continuous&#8208;flow experiment, and versatile manipulation of products have demonstrated the robustness and potential utility of this synthetic method.







Abstract
Functional group translocation is undoubtedly a pivotal synthetic transformation in organic chemistry. Numerous types of reactions involving radical 1,2&#8208;aryl or 1,4&#8208;aryl migration via electron transfer mechanism have been extensively investigated. Nevertheless, energy&#8208;transfer enabled 1,4&#8208;arylation remains unknown. Herein we disclose that an unprecedented di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;ethane rearrangement featuring 1,4&#8208;aryl migration facilitated by energy transfer catalysis under visible light conditions. The newly developed mild protocol exhibits tolerance towards diverse functional groups and enables the migration of a multitude of aromatic rings, encompassing both electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;rich functional groups. The open&#8208;shell strategy has also found successful application in the modification of several drugs. Large&#8208;scale experiments, continuous&#8208;flow experiment, and versatile manipulation of products have demonstrated the robustness and potential utility of this synthetic method. Preliminary mechanistic studies have supported the involvement of radical species in this di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;ethane rearrangement and have also provided evidence for the energy transfer mechanism.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Hydrazide&#8208;Based Nanochannels: Efficient Water Translocation and Salt Rejection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrazide backbone&#8208;derived structures create a paired water&#8208;conveying conduit in the solid state and the lipid bilayer membrane. These channel arrangements effectively facilitate water transport across the bilayer membrane while preventing the passage of protons and salts.







Abstract
Nature has ingeniously developed specialized water transporters that effectively reject ions, including protons, while transporting water across membranes. These natural water channels, known as aquaporins (AQPs), have inspired the creation of Artificial Water Channels (AWCs). However, replicating superfast water transport with synthetic molecular structures that exclude salts and protons is a challenging task. This endeavor demands the coexistence of a suitable water&#8208;binding site and a selective filter for precise water transportation. Here, we present small&#8208;molecule hydrazides 1&#8201;b&#8211;1&#8201;d that self&#8208;assemble into a rosette&#8208;type nanochannel assembly through intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, and selectively transport water molecules across lipid bilayer membranes. The experimental analysis demonstrates notable permeability rates for the 1&#8201;c derivative, enabling approximately 3.18&#215;108 water molecules to traverse the channel per second. This permeability rate is about one order of magnitude lower than that of AQPs. Of particular significance, the 1&#8201;c ensures exclusive passage of water molecules while effectively blocking salts and protons. MD simulation studies confirmed the stability and water transport properties of the water channel assembly inside the bilayer membranes at ambient conditions.

         <title>Structurally Asymmetric Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Mn Node in Metal&#8211;Organic Layers on Carbon Nitride Support for CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exchange of high&#8208;spin Mn2+ into Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ni nodes induced Jahn&#8211;Teller lattice distortion at adjacent Ni sites, significantly enhancing CO2 photoreduction by promoting CO2 adsorption through enhanced orbital overlap and facilitating charge carrier migration via additional spin&#8208;polarized electrons.







Abstract
The Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) effect&#8208;induced lattice distortion presents an advantageous approach to tailor the electronic structure and CO2 adsorption properties of catalytic centers, consequently conferring desirable photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity. Nevertheless, achieving precise J&#8211;T distortion control over catalytic sites to enhance CO2 adsorption/activation and target&#8208;product desorption remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we successfully induced J&#8211;T lattice distortion in neighboring Ni sites by exchanging high&#8208;spin Mn2+ into Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ni nodes. EXAFS results and DFT simulations revealed that the highly asymmetric Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Mn nodes induced structural contraction (shortened Ni&#8722;O bonds) in the adjacent Ni&#8722;O lattice. The magnetic hysteresis loop (M&#8722;H) confirmed that the introduction of Mn2+ increased the number of spin electrons, thereby increasing the magnetization intensity. The spin mismatch between photogenerated electrons and holes suppressed charge recombination. Significantly, the d orbitals of the Ni sites in the Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Mn nodes exhibited strong orbital hybridization with the p orbitals of CO2, as evidenced by the enhanced d&#8208;p orbital overlap, facilitating rapid CO2 adsorption and activation. Consequently, the sample featuring lattice&#8208;mismatched Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Mn nodes exhibited an 8.79&#8208;fold enhancement in CO production rate compared to the Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ni nodes, in the absence of cocatalysts and sacrificial reagents.

         <title>Reviving Multivalent&#8208;Metal Anodes in Simple Salt Electrolytes via Component Modifier Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsically impervious passivating film on multivalent&#8208;metal anodes seriously impairs their cycling efficiencies and lifespan. To address this issue, this work proposes the structure design principle of component modifiers via balancing the corrosion and passivation reactions toward metal&#8208;anodes, achieving exceptional metal electro&#8208;plating/stripping cycling stability.







Abstract
Using combinatory electrolyte blends represents an imperative avenue to achieve good magnesium (Mg)&#8208;metal anode compatibility and commercial feasibility in fields of promising rechargeable Mg batteries. However, fundamental challenges of how to manipulate component modifier reactivity on molecule level still remain to be solved. Here, molecular structure design concepts towards seeking bromophenyl complex&#8208;based component modifiers has been proposed according to implications of electron&#8208;donating and/or electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on Br&#8722;C bond dissociation reactivity. Exceptional Mg electro&#8208;plating/stripping properties (a stable cycle life of 250&#8197;days in Mg//Cu asymmetric cells) have been firstly achieved in a simple salt electrolyte with 1&#8208;(3&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylmethanamine (BPDMA) as optimal component modifier. Comprehensive analyses disclose the unique electrochemically&#8208;active Br&#8208;containing ion&#8208;pairs formation, such as [(Mg2+)2(TFSI&#8722;)Br&#8722;]2+ and [(Mg2+)2(TFSI&#8722;)(Br&#8722;)(G2)2]2+, which results in the much thinner Br&#8722; containing and organic&#8211;inorganic mixed interphases on Mg&#8208;metal anodes. Furthermore, conventional MgSO4&#8208;based electrolytes and even calcium (Ca)&#8208;ion electrolytes can also be revived by similar strategy, demonstrating its generality and superiority.

         <title>Fully Exposed Ru Clusters for the Efficient Multi&#8208;Step Toluene Hydrogenation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fully exposed and atomically dispersed Ru clusters composed by an average of 3 Ru atoms were successfully fabricated and exhibited robust catalytic performance in the multi&#8208;step hydrogenation of toluene to methylcyclohexane, compared with Ru single atoms, Ru nanoparticles and even previously reported catalysts. The theoretical calculations revealed that the synergetic interaction among neighboring Ru atoms in the fully exposed cluster guarantees effective activation of the reactant and easy desorption of the product.







Abstract
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) are attractive platform molecules that play an important role in hydrogen energy storage and utilization. The multi&#8208;step hydrogenation of toluene (TOL) to methylcyclohexane (MCH) has been widely studied in the LOCHs systems, due to their relatively low toxicity and reasonable hydrogen storage capacity. Noble metal catalysts such as Ru has exhibited good performance in multi&#8208;step hydrogenation reactions, while the application is still hindered by their high cost and low specific activity. Therefore, the primary challenge lies in the development of noble metal catalysts with both robust activity and efficient atomic utilization. In this study, a series of Ru species ranging from single atoms, fully exposed clusters to nanoparticles were fabricated to investigate their structural evolution in the TOL multi&#8208;step hydrogenation reaction. The fully exposed and atomically dispersed Ru clusters, composed of an average of 3 Ru atoms, exhibit superior catalytic performance and recycle ability in TOL multi&#8208;step hydrogenation. Moreover, it delivers a high turnover frequency of 9850.3&#8197;h&#8722;1 under the relatively mild reaction (100&#8201;&#176;C, 1.5&#8197;MPa), compared with those of single atoms and nanoparticles, and shows a notable advantage over catalysts reported in previous studies. From density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the overall barrier of the TOL multi&#8208;step hydrogenation reaction over the fully exposed Ru clusters is significantly lower than that of single atoms and nanoparticles, resulting in its higher activity. The present work provides an efficient strategy to regulate the reaction pathway of multi&#8208;step complicated catalytic reactions by designing fully exposed metal cluster catalysts.

         <title>Simultaneous Cycloadditions in the Solid State via Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous [4+4] and [2+2] cycloadditions are achieved within a single crystalline solid for the first time. The cycloadditions occur with complete control over regiochemistry, stereochemistry, and in high yield, whereas simultaneous solution reactions afford a mixture of isomers. Reaction reversibility and application to solar thermal storage materials is also discussed.







Abstract
Chemical reactions conducted in the solid phase (specifically, crystalline) are much less numerous than solution reactions, primarily due to reduced motion, flexibility, and reactivity. The main advantage of crystalline&#8208;state transformations is that reactant molecules can be designed to self&#8208;assemble into specific spatial arrangements, often leading to high control over product regiochemistry and/or stereochemistry. In crystalline&#8208;phase transformations, typically only one type of reaction occurs, and a sacrificial template molecule is frequently used to facilitate self&#8208;assembly, similar to a catalyst or enzyme. Here, we demonstrate the first system designed to undergo two chemically unique and orthogonal cycloaddition reactions simultaneously within a single crystalline solid. Well&#8208;controlled supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of two molecules containing different reactive moieties affords orthogonal reactivity without use of a sacrificial template. Using only UV light, the simultaneous [2+2] and [4+4] cycloadditions are achieved regiospecifically, stereospecifically, and products are obtained in high yield, whereas a simultaneous solution&#8208;state reaction affords a mixture of isomers in low yield. Application of dually&#8208;reactive systems toward (supra)molecular solar thermal storage materials is also discussed. This work demonstrates fundamental chemical approaches for orthogonal reactivity in the crystalline state and highlights the complexity and reversibility that can be achieved with supramolecular design.

         <title>Autocatalytic Reaction Networks: A Pathway to Spatial Temporal Mastery in Dynamic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autocatalytic chemical reaction network (CRN) has been developed that enables efficient control over sol(I)&#8208;gel and gel&#8208;sol(II) transitions through autocatalytic fronts. This approach, supported by a reaction&#8208;diffusion model, provides a theoretical framework for system preprogramming and demonstrates the potential for reversible, repeatable sol&#8208;gel transitions, shaping new frontiers in material science and bioengineering.







Abstract
Autocatalytic reaction present a significant opportunity for the precise spatial and temporal control of dynamic materials, mimicking the characteristics of living matter within autonomous chemical systems. Herein, we have crafted an autocatalytic chemical reaction network (CRN) designed to be incorporated into a dynamic system, allowing for efficient control of both sol(I)&#8208;gel and gel&#8208;sol(II) transitions through autocatalytic fronts. The CRN incorporates two autocatalytic reactions. The first reaction promotes the formation of disulfide crosslinks while increasing the local pH through base product generation, catalyzing further disulfide bond formation and initiating a polymerization front that transforms the liquid phase into a gel. A subsequent, slower reaction triggered at the gel/air interface, resulted in the breakage of disulfide crosslinks, transforming the gel back into a liquid state through accelerating fronts. The dynamics of these autocatalytic fronts are accurately predicted by a reaction&#8208;diffusion model, providing a theoretical framework for system preprogramming. Moreover, our results show that the reversible sol&#8208;gel transition can be reliably repeated multiple times. This approach not only enhances our understanding of autocatalytic CRNs but also pioneers a new approach for developing dynamic materials with life&#8208;like properties, significantly impacting material science and bioengineering.

         <title>Endo&#8208;Encapsulated Multi&#8208;Resonance Dendrimers with Through&#8208;Space Interactions for Efficient Narrowband Blue&#8208;Emitting Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs</title>

Endo&#8208;encapsulated luminescent dendrimers consisting of multi&#8208;resonance fluorophore embedded inside of carbazole dendrons are first reported, which not only resist aggregation&#8208;caused spectral broadening but also induce through&#8208;space interactions between dendron and fluorophore to accelerate reverse intersystem crossing, giving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device efficiency with maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.6&#8201;% for narrowband luminescent dendrimers so far.







Abstract
Different from conventional luminescent dendrimers with fluorophore tethered outside to dendron, here we first developed endo&#8208;encapsulated luminescent dendrimers with multi&#8208;resonance (MR) fluorophore embedded inside of carbazole dendrons by growing dendrons through 1,8&#8208;positions of central carbazole moiety to create a cavity for accommodating the fluorophore. This endo&#8208;encapsulated structure not only shields the fluorophore to fully resist aggregation&#8208;caused spectral broadening, but also induce through&#8208;space interactions between dendron and fluorophore via intramolecular &#960;&#8208;stacking, giving lowered singlet state energy and reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting to accelerate reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from triplet to singlet states. The resultant dendrimer containing 1,8&#8208;linked second&#8208;generation carbazole dendrons and boron, sulfur&#8208;doped polycyclic MR fluorophore exhibits narrowband blue emission at 471&#8197;nm with FWHM kept at 34&#8197;nm even in neat film, together with ~4&#8197;times enhancement of RISC rate constant compared to its exo&#8208;tethered counterpart. Solution&#8208;processed OLEDs based on the endo&#8208;encapsulated dendrimer reveal efficient narrowband blue emissions with maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.6&#8201;%, representing the best device efficiency for blue&#8208;emitting multi&#8208;resonance dendrimers so far.

         <title>Designing a Refined Multi&#8208;Structural Polymer Electrolyte Framework for Highly Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous and multi&#8208;component ion&#8208;conductive polymer&#8208;based electrolyte was designed based on a refined multi&#8208;structural polymer electrolyte (RMSPE) framework. Lithium metal cells with RMSPE have the advantages of high ionic conductivity (0.93&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C), high electrochemical window (to 5.1&#8197;V), high Li+ transference number (0.7), long lifetime (&gt;3300 cycles at 1&#8197;C at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and excellent low&#8208;temperature adaptability (&gt;200 cycles at 1&#8197;C and &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
Rational structural designs of solid polymer electrolytes featuring rich interface&#8208;phase morphologies can improve electrolyte connection and rapid ion transport. However, these rigid interfacial structures commonly result in diminished or entirely inert ionic conductivity within their bulk phase, compromising overall electrolyte performance. Herein, a multi&#8208;component ion&#8208;conductive electrolyte was successfully designed based on a refined multi&#8208;structural polymer electrolyte (RMSPE) framework with uniform Li+ solvation chemistry and rapid Li+ transporting kinetics.

&lt;p&gt;A homogeneous and multi-component ion-conductive polymer-based electrolyte was designed based on a refined multi-structural polymer electrolyte (RMSPE) framework. Lithium metal cells with RMSPE have the advantages of high ionic conductivity (0.93&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C), high electrochemical window (to 5.1&#8197;V), high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number (0.7), long lifetime (&amp;gt;3300 cycles at 1&#8197;C at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and excellent low-temperature adaptability (&amp;gt;200 cycles at 1&#8197;C and &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational structural designs of solid polymer electrolytes featuring rich interface-phase morphologies can improve electrolyte connection and rapid ion transport. However, these rigid interfacial structures commonly result in diminished or entirely inert ionic conductivity within their bulk phase, compromising overall electrolyte performance. Herein, a multi-component ion-conductive electrolyte was successfully designed based on a refined multi-structural polymer electrolyte (RMSPE) framework with uniform Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation chemistry and rapid Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transporting kinetics. The RMSPE framework is constructed via polymerization-induced phase separation based on a rational combination of lithiophilic components and rigid/flexible chain units with significant hydrophobic/hydrophilic contrasts. Further refined by coating a robust polymer network, this all-organic design endows a homogeneous micro-nano porous structure, providing a novel framework favorable for rapid ion transport in both its soft interfacial and bulk phases. The RMSPE exhibited excellent ion conductivity of 1.91&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature and a high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number of 0.7. Assembled symmetrical Li cells realized stable cycling for over 2400&#8197;h at 3.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; full batteries demonstrated a long lifespan of 3300 cycles with a capacity retention of 93.5&#8201;% and stable cycling performance at &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Opal&#8208;Inspired SiO2&#8208;Mediated Carbon Dot Doping Enables the Synthesis of Monodisperse Multifunctional Afterglow Nanocomposites for Advanced Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drawing inspiration from the formation of nanoinclusions in opal, we present a novel SiO2&#8208;mediated carbon dot doping method for fabricating monodisperse, multifunctional afterglow nanocomposites. This versatile method offers significant flexibility in selecting core nanoparticles and doping impurities, enabling the integration of multifunctionality into single&#8208;particle platforms. Additionally, it allows for precise optical tuning of the afterglow characteristics.







Abstract
Despite recent advancements in inorganic and organic phosphors, creating monodisperse afterglow nanocomposites (NCs) remains challenging due to the complexities of wet chemistry synthesis. Inspired by nanoinclusions in opal, we introduce a novel SiO2&#8208;mediated carbon dot (CD) doping method for fabricating monodisperse, multifunctional afterglow NCs. This method involves growing a SiO2 shell matrix on monodisperse nanoparticles (NPs) and doping CDs into the SiO2 shell under hydrothermal conditions. Our approach preserves the monodispersity of the parent NP@SiO2 NCs while activating a green afterglow in the doped CDs with an impressive lifetime of 1.26&#8197;s. Additionally, this method is highly versatile, allowing for various core and dopant combinations to finely tune the afterglow through core&#8208;to&#8208;CD or CD&#8208;to&#8208;dye energy transfer. Our findings significantly enhance the potential of SiO2 coatings, transforming them from merely enhancing the biocompatibility of NCs to serving as a versatile matrix for emitters, facilitating afterglow generation and paving the way for new applications.

         <title>Atmosphere Induces Tunable Oxygen Vacancies to Stabilize Single&#8208;Atom Copper in Ceria for Robust Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>

Oxygen vacancy stabilizes the single&#8208;atomic copper active site, which effectively promotes CO2 activation, and regulates the adsorption energy of key reaction intermediates on the surface of Cu/ceria catalyst, thus improving the selectivity and conversion rate to methane in ECO2RR.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (ECO2RR) shows great potential to create high&#8208;value carbon&#8208;based chemicals, while designing advanced catalysts at the atomic level remains challenging. The ECO2RR performance is largely dependent on the catalyst microelectronic structure that can be effectively modulated through surface defect engineering. Here, we provide an atmosphere&#8208;assisted low&#8208;temperature calcination strategy to prepare a series of single&#8208;atomic Cu/ceria catalysts with varied oxygen vacancy concentrations for robust electrolytic reduction of CO2 to methane. The obtained Cu/ceria catalyst under H2 environment (Cu/ceria&#8208;H2) exhibits a methane Faraday efficiency (FECH4) of 70.03&#8201;% with a turnover frequency (TOFCH4) of 9946.7&#8197;h&#8722;1 at an industrial&#8208;scale current density of 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell. Detailed studies indicate the copious oxygen vacancies in the Cu/ceria&#8208;H2 are conducive to regulating the surface microelectronic structure with stabilized Cu+ active center. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations and operando ATR&#8208;SEIRAS demonstrate that the Cu/ceria&#8208;H2 can markedly enhance the activation of CO2, facilitate the adsorption of pivotal intermediates *COOH and *CO, thus ultimately enabling the high selectivity for CH4 production. This study presents deep insights into designing effective electrocatalysts for CO2 to CH4 conversion by controlling the surface microstructure via the reaction atmosphere.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Anionic Coordination Manipulation Induces Phosphorus and Boron&#8208;Rich Gradient Interphase Towards Stable and Safe Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a flame&#8208;retardant electrolyte that constructs a gradient CEI dominated by inorganic compounds. This interphase is thin, dense, and enriched with phosphides and borides, which effectively inhibits side&#8208;reactions and facilitates rapid Na+ transport, thus enabling safe and stable cycling of SMBs.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage sodium metal batteries (SMBs) present a viable pathway towards high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;based batteries due to the competitive cost advantage and abundant supply of sodium resources. However, they still suffer from severe capacity decay induced by the notorious decomposition of the electrolyte under high voltage and unstable cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI). In addition, the high reactivity of Na metal and flammable electrolytes push SMBs to their safety limits. Herein, a special dual&#8208;anion aggregated Na+ solvation structure is designed in a nonflammable trimethyl phosphate&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte, and a gradient CEI enriched with phosphorus and boron compounds is formed on the cathode. This thin and stable interphase effectively suppresses the parasitic reaction, improves the interfacial stability of the cathode, and facilitates Na+ transport through the interface by the synergistic effect of multi&#8208;components, thus optimizing the cycling stability and safety of SMBs. The Na0.95Ni0.4Fe0.15Mn0.3Ti0.15O2//Na batteries employing such electrolyte provide a discharge capacity of 167.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and high retention in the capacity of 85.2&#8201;% after 800&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. This approach offers a general strategy for the design of flame&#8208;retardant high&#8208;voltage electrolytes and the practical application of SMBs.

         <title>Bright Nanocomposites based on Quantum Dot&#8208;Initiated Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum Dot (QD)&#8208;polymer nanocomposites with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield aredemonstrated through a novel approach, where bright QDs effectively photoinitiate (photocatalyze) in&#8197;situ bulk polymerization. Without using any radical initiators and cocatalysts, the photoexcited QDs act as &#8216;overall reaction&#8217; catalysts by simultaneously employing photoexcited holes and electrons to produce active radicals for initiating radical polymerization.







Abstract
Integrating quantum dots (QDs) into polymer matrix to form nanocomposites without compromising the QD photoluminescence (PL) is crucial to emerging QD light&#8208;emitting and solar energy conversion fields. However, the most widely&#8208;used bulk polymerization technique, where monomers serve as the QD solvent, usually leads to QD PL quenching caused by radical initiators. Here we demonstrate high&#8208;brightness nanocomposites with near&#8208;unity PL quantum yield (QY), through a novel QDs&#8208;catalyzed (&#8208;initiated) bulk polymerization without using any radical initiators. Different from previous reports where QDs were designed as photo&#8208;sensitizers/catalysts (always with cocatalysts) and hence non&#8208;emissive in catalytic conditions, our QDs combine high brightness with highly effective catalysis, a combination that was previously considered to be hardly possible. In our case, apart from emitting light (at a large probability), the photoexcited QDs act as &#8216;overall reaction&#8217; catalysts by simultaneously employing photoexcited electrons and holes to produce active radicals without the need of any sacrificial agents. These active radicals, though with a small amount, are sufficient to initiate effective chain reaction&#8208;dominated bulk polymerization, eliminating the requirement of extra radical initiators. This study provides new insights for understanding and development of QDs for energy applications.

However, the most widely-used bulk polymerization technique, where monomers serve as the QD solvent, usually leads to QD PL quenching caused by radical initiators.

         <title>Calcium Carbonate as an Ionic Molecular Lock for Ultrastrong Fluorescence of Single Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we modified organic molecules with calcium carbonate oligomers (CCO, (CaCO3)n) in individual molecular states, functionalizing organic molecules with inorganic ionic segments as molecular locks. Due to the rigidity of ionic compound and characteristic of ionic bond, it realized the ultrastrong fluorescence of organic molecules in single molecular state without the change of maximum emission wavelength both in solution and solid.







Abstract
Locking molecular conformation are widely applied in molecular engineering for improved performance. However, locking via organic functional groups often changes the original molecular properties. Following the rigidity and stability of ionic interaction in ionic compounds, we suggested the use of a molecular&#8208;scale ionic compound, calcium carbonate oligomer, as a robust molecular segment to functionalize organic molecules. The rigid structure of the ionic molecular segments locked the organic molecules, which could remarkably limit the intramolecular motion and intermolecular interactions. This ensured a stable and ultrastrong fluorescence of the single organic molecule while preserving its original maximum emission wavelength. The locking strategy was general and extendable to multiple organic molecules. Additionally, the ultrastrong single&#8208;molecular fluorescence can be maintained in inorganic solids with even higher quantum yields and almost unchanged maximum emission wavelength. The highest quantum yield of the investigated molecules reached 99.9&#8201;%, superior to all reported organic&#8208;inorganic fluorescent composite under air conditions. This work demonstrates a general strategy to restrict intramolecular motion and intermolecular interactions by using ionic oligomers as molecular locks, providing an alternative method for realizing ultraemissive molecules. This further demonstrates a fascinating example of molecular engineering in the presence of inorganic ionic molecules.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional (3D) Fluoride Molecular Glue to Improve the SnO2/Perovskite Interface for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly effective 3D fluoride molecular glue strategy has been developed for efficient and stable PSCs. Simultaneous incorporation of the KBF4/TFMSA demonstrates 25.8&#8201;% PCE with negligible hysteresis, and 1&#8197;cm2 PSCs presents a certified 24.57&#8201;% PCE. The KBF4 and TFMSA afford 3D fluoride passivator by strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Synergistic passivation effect toward the SnO2 and perovskite layer can reduce the non&#8208;radiative recombination and guarantee high&#8208;performance including exceptional stability.







Abstract
Aiming at numerous defects at SnO2/perovskite interface and lattice mismatch in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), we design a kind of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) molecular glue (KBF4&#8208;TFMSA), which is derived from strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding interaction between potassium tetrafluoroborate (KBF4) and trifluoromethane&#8208;sulfonamide (TFMSA). A remarkable efficiency of 25.8&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis and a stabilized power output of 25.0&#8201;% have been achieved, in addition, 24.57&#8201;% certified efficiency of 1&#8197;cm2 device is also obtained. Further investigation reveals that this KBF4&#8208;TFMSA can interact with oxygen vacancies and under&#8208;coordinated Sn(IV) from the SnO2, in the meantime, FA+ (NH2&#8722;C=NH2+) and K+ cations can be well fixed by hydrogen bonding interaction between FA+ and BF4&#8722;, and electrostatic attraction between sulfonyl oxygen and K+ ions, respectively. Thereby, FAPbI3 crystal grain sizes are increased, interfacial defects are significantly reduced while carrier extraction/ transportation is facilitated, leading to better cell performance and excellent stabilities. Non&#8208;encapsulated devices can maintain 91&#8201;% of their initial efficiency under maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point (MPP) tracking while continuous illumination (~100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for 1000&#8197;h, and retain 91&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;h &#8220;double 60&#8221; damp&#8208;heat stability testing (60&#8201;&#176;C and 60&#8201;%RH (RH, relatively humidity)).

         <title>Nanocarriers Made of Natural Fatty Acids: Modulation of Their Release Profiles through Photo&#8208;Crosslinking</title>

Slow down: Photo&#8208;crosslinking is used to mitigate the dissolution and degradation of natural fatty acids in a body fluid mimic, achieving sustained release in cells with controllable kinetics for drug delivery, nanomedicine, and related applications.







Abstract
Natural fatty acids are attractive carrier materials for drug delivery, but their rapid dissolution and degradation in vivo calls for new strategies to enhance their stability. Here we report a simple and versatile method capable of photo&#8208;crosslinking carriers made of natural fatty acids for drug delivery under controlled release. By optimizing the crosslinking density, the nanoscale carriers show a high drug loading efficiency, together with a stable network structure for minimal degradation in a body fluid mimic. Fluorescence microscopy analysis also reveals the exceptional intracellular stability of the crosslinked network, resulting in negligible cytotoxicity toward A549 cells up to 24&#8197;h when loaded with a potent anticancer drug. We further extend this strategy to microscale carriers fabricated using electrospray. Upon photo&#8208;crosslinking, the carriers show a retarded release of nerve growth factor, resulting in slower neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglion. This work holds promise for addressing the efficacy and safety issues critical to nanomedicine and related applications.

         <title>Conformational Modulation of Efficient Macrocyclic Emitters Featuring Delayed Fluorescence by Conjugation Length and Cavity Dimensions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel macrocyclic thermally activated delayed fluorescence compounds, MC&#8208;TNT and MC&#8208;TST, with varying conjugation lengths and cavity dimensions were synthesized for application in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. A record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency of 32.7&#8201;% was achieved by the device based on MC&#8208;TST, showcasing the potential of TADF macrocycles in organic optoelectronics.







Abstract
The &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocyclic emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics have attracted widespread attention in the field of organic electroluminescence (EL) materials due to their unique geometries and excellent luminescence performance. Despite the significant impact of conjugation length and cavity dimensions on molecular conformation, the influence of these factors on the excited&#8208;state properties remains understudied. Herein, we formulated a strategy aimed at modulating the conformation of TADF macrocyclic molecules containing aniline as the donor (D) unit, and triazine as the acceptor (A), linked in D&#8722;A and D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A alternative macrocyclic construction (MC&#8208;TNT and MC&#8208;TST). Corroborated by experimental and theoretical analyses, the compact and conformationally twisted MC&#8208;TNT exhibits efficient blue luminescence in crystalline state, facilitating EL at high doping concentrations with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 13.9&#8201;%, leading the field of blue macrocyclic emitters. Notably, MC&#8208;TST with &#960;&#8208;bridge and flat conformation, demonstrates diminished Coulombic repulsion, achieving nearly 100&#8201;% photoluminescence quantum yield and superior horizontal dipole orientation of 85&#8201;% in 5&#8197;wt&#8201;% doped films, and the corresponding device&#8216;s EQEmax reaches record&#8208;high 32.7&#8201;% within the TADF macrocyclic domain.

A record-breaking external quantum efficiency of 32.7&#8201;% was achieved by the device based on &lt;b&gt;MC-TST&lt;/b&gt;, showcasing the potential of TADF macrocycles in organic optoelectronics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#960;-conjugated macrocyclic emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics have attracted widespread attention in the field of organic electroluminescence (EL) materials due to their unique geometries and excellent luminescence performance. Despite the significant impact of conjugation length and cavity dimensions on molecular conformation, the influence of these factors on the excited-state properties remains understudied. Herein, we formulated a strategy aimed at modulating the conformation of TADF macrocyclic molecules containing aniline as the donor (D) unit, and triazine as the acceptor (A), linked in D&#8722;A and D-&#960;-A alternative macrocyclic construction (&lt;b&gt;MC-TNT&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;MC-TST&lt;/b&gt;). Corroborated by experimental and theoretical analyses, the compact and conformationally twisted &lt;b&gt;MC-TNT&lt;/b&gt; exhibits efficient blue luminescence in crystalline state, facilitating EL at high doping concentrations with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 13.9&#8201;%, leading the field of blue macrocyclic emitters. Notably, &lt;b&gt;MC-TST&lt;/b&gt; with &#960;-bridge and flat conformation, demonstrates diminished Coulombic repulsion, achieving nearly 100&#8201;% photoluminescence quantum yield and superior horizontal dipole orientation of 85&#8201;% in 5&#8197;wt&#8201;% doped films, and the corresponding device&#8216;s EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; reaches record-high 32.7&#8201;% within the TADF macrocyclic domain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Stage Reduction Strategy of Tin Perovskite Enables High Performance Photovoltaics</title>

This study firstly proposes sustained dynamic reduction using a dual&#8208;stage reduction strategy to fabricate devices of high efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. Ultimately, a champion power conversion efficiency of 14.78&#8201;% and 90&#8201;% of initial efficiency after 628&#8197;h at maximum power.







Abstract
The rapid oxidation of Sn2+ in tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) restricts their efficiency and stability have been main bottleneck towards further development. This study developed a novel strategy which utilizes thiosulfate ions (S2O32&#8722;) in the precursor solution to enable a dual&#8208;stage reduction process. In the solution stage, thiosulfate acted as an efficacious reducing agent to reduce Sn4+ to Sn2+, meanwhile, its oxidation products were able to reduce I2 to I&#8722; during the film stage. This dual reduction ability effectively inhibited the oxidation of Sn2+ and passivated defects, further promising an excellent stability of the perovskite devices. As a result, thiosulfate&#8208;incorporated devices achieved a high efficiency of 14.78&#8201;% with open&#8208;circuit voltage reaching 0.96&#8197;V. The stability of the optimized devices achieved a remarkable improvement, maintaining 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiencies after 628&#8197;hours at maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point (MPP). The findings provid research insights and experimental data support for the sustained dynamic reduction in TPSCs.

         <title>A Structural and Functional Mimic of P680+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimeric MgII&#8208;porphyrin complex has been developed as a structural and functional mimic of the dimeric&#8208;chlorophyll reaction center found in photosystem II. The corresponding &#960;&#8208;cation radical complex was prepared and characterized. The dimeric &#960;&#8208;cation radical showed markedly higher rates of proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) oxidation of phenols compared to its monomeric counterpart indicating that photosynthetic reaction centers may employ multiple &#960;&#8208;conjugated complexes in order to lower the barrier to PCET oxidation.







Abstract
One or multiple chlorophyll a molecules are employed in the reaction center of photosystem II&#8242;s main electron donor (defined as P680). We have a poor understanding of how the reaction center facilitates water oxidation in photosystem II and the roles that mono&#8208; and/or multimeric chlorophyll groups play when P680 oxidizes a neighboring tyrosine in order to drive water oxidation at the oxygen evolving complex. We have prepared a dimeric MgII&#8208;porphyrin complex [Mg2(BTPP)] (1, H4&#8208;BTPP=1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;(10,15,20&#8208;triphenylporphyrin&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;benzene) as a structural and functional mimic of the dimeric core of P680. 1 was oxidized by one&#8208;electron to the corresponding &#960;&#8208;cation radical complex 2. The radical cation was characterized by UV/Vis&#8208;NIR, FT&#8208;IR, and EPR spectroscopic techniques. 2 was shown to be reactive towards phenols to give the corresponding phenoxyl radicals, mimicking the reactivity of the P680 cation radical which oxidizes tyrosine to tyrosyl radical. Critically, the dimeric &#960;&#8208;cation radical showed markedly higher rates of proton coupled electron transfer oxidation (PCET) of phenols when compared to its monomeric counterpart [Mg(TPP)] (TPP=5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin). Our findings demonstrate that MgII&#8208;porphyrin complexes are reliable mimics of photosynthetic PCET processes and suggest that photosynthetic reaction centers with multiple &#960;&#8208;conjugated complexes likely lower the barrier to PCET oxidation by &#960;&#8208;cation radical species.

         <title>Upcycling Iron Oxide Scale Slag into a High&#8208;Performance, Sustainable Ozone Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Iron oxide scale slag by creating a compact junction between Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 phases, their synergistic effect could be harnessed by inhibiting passivation of the Fe2O3 surface and enhancing the catalytic conversion of the adsorbed O3 on the Fe3O4 surface, thus reducing catalyst deactivation and improving the treatment ability of practical antibiotic wastewater (after 2&#8197;h treatment, COD removal rate 81.7&#8201;%).







Abstract
Upcycling iron slag into a monolithic catalyst has led to low&#8208;cost heterogeneous catalytic ozonation (HCO) strategies for water treatment. The primary industrial challenges are the low chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction rate in treating authentic wastewater and difficulties sustaining close&#8208;loop reaction cycles. In this study, we present a monolithic catalyst transformed from low&#8208;cost iron oxide scale slag (IOSM) for highly efficient, sustainable ozone catalysis. The IOSM, constituted of 59.70&#8201;% Fe2O3 and 40.30&#8201;% Fe3O4, effectively decomposes ozone into superoxide radicals (&#8901;O2&#8722;) through a close&#8208;loop cyclic reaction facilitated by interfacial charge transfer. This mechanism enables super&#8208;fast degradation of 100&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 tetracycline at ozone concentrations below 1.00&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 in just four minutes, with the iron leaching merely at 59&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 after 10 cycles. In tests with authentic antibiotic wastewater, the IOSM&#8208;based HCO system achieves a record&#8208;breaking 81.70&#8201;% COD reduction within two hours. This research underscores the potential of upcycling industrial waste into highly effective ozone catalysts for sustainable practices in wastewater treatment.

A novel ideal one&#8208;dimensional (1D) S=5/2 chain antiferromagnetic compound [H2(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)](H3O)2Fe2F10 (4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy=4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl) is obtained by single&#8208;step hydrothermal method at low temperature by intentionally pronating 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy ligand.

Abstract
One&#8208;dimensional (1D) magnets are of great interest owing to their intriguing quantum phenomena and potential application in quantum computing. We successfully synthesized an ideal antiferromagnetic spin S=5/2 chain compound [H2(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)](H3O)2Fe2F10 (4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy=4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl) 1, using a single&#8208;step low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal method under conditions that favors the protonation of the bulky bidentate ligand 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy. Compound 1 consists of well&#8208;separated (Fe3+&#8722;F&#8722;)&#8734; chains with a large Fe&#8722;F&#8722;Fe angle of 174.8&#176;. Both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements show that 1 does not undergo a magnetic long&#8208;range ordering down to 0.5&#8197;K, despite the strong Fe&#8722;F&#8722;Fe intrachain spin exchange J with J/kB=&#8722;16.2(1) K. This indicates a negligibly weak interchain spin exchange J&#8242;. The J&#8242;/J value estimated for 1 is extremely small (&lt;2.8&#215;10&#8722;6), smaller than those reported for all other S=5/2 chain magnets. Our hydrothermal synthesis incorporates both [H2(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)]2+ and (H3O)+ cations into the crystal lattice with numerous hydrogen bonds, hence effectively separating the (Fe3+&#8722;F&#8722;)&#8734; spin chains. This single&#8208;step hydrothermal synthesis under conditions favoring the protonation of bulky bidentate ligands offers an effective synthetic strategy to prepare well&#8208;separated 1D spin chain systems of magnetic ions with various spin values.

&lt;p&gt;One-dimensional (1D) magnets are of great interest owing to their intriguing quantum phenomena and potential application in quantum computing.

         <title>C(sp3)&#8722;F Bond Activation by Lewis Base&#8208;Boryl Radicals via Concerted Electron&#8208;Fluoride Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative concerted electron&#8208;fluoride transfer (cEF&#8722;T) mechanism is revealed for C(sp3)&#8722;F activation by Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals (LBBRs) with the aid of DFT calculations. Orbital interaction analyses have been conducted for rational design of LBBRs that could selectively activate the resilient C&#8722;F bonds in fluoroalkanes, which enables the direct abstraction of a fluorine atom from fluorocarbons and the generation of an alkyl radical, broadening the scope of XAT reactions.







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;F bond activation through a radical pathway in the presence of multiple C&#8722;H bonds remains a formidable challenge, owing to the extraordinarily strong bond strength of the C&#8722;F bond. By the aid of density functional theory calculations, we disclose an innovative concerted electron&#8208;fluoride transfer mechanism, harnessing the unique reactivity of Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals to selectively activate the resilient C&#8722;F bonds in fluoroalkanes. This enables the direct abstraction of a fluorine atom and subsequent generation of an alkyl radical, thus expanding the boundaries of halogen atom transfer reactions.

         <title>Enantioselective Electrocatalysis for Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Heteroarylation with Indoles, Pyrroles, and Furans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct anodic oxidative coupling process for &#945;&#8208;heteroarylation using ferrocene&#8208;assisted asymmetric nickel electrocatalysis has been developed, enabling the synthesis of a diverse range of chiral heteroaromatic carbonyl compounds with high enantioselectivity and functional group tolerance, which can be applied to the synthesis of valuable frameworks like (&#8722;)&#8208;COX&#8208;2 inhibitor, (+)&#8208;acremoauxin A, and (+)&#8208;pemedolac.







Abstract
Oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H functionalizations represent an exemplary approach for synthesizing carbonyl compounds via &#945;&#8208;heteroarylation. Here we present the development of a direct anodic oxidative coupling process between 2&#8208;acylimidazoles and divergent heterocyclic systems including indole, pyrrole, and furan, facilitated by ferrocene&#8208;assisted asymmetric nickel electrocatalysis with high levels of enantioselectivity. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction initially involves the formation of a chiral Ni&#8208;bound &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical, which is then captured by the heteroarene radical cation via intermolecular stereoselective radical/radical cation coupling. The mild, scalable, and robust reaction conditions allow for a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance, enabling access to a wide range of chiral hetero&#8208;compounds. The consequential &#945;&#8208;heteroaromatic carbonyl products can potentially be transformed into a plethora of synthetically valuable frameworks, as exemplified by their application in the asymmetric total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;COX&#8208;2 inhibitor, (+)&#8208;acremoauxin A, and (+)&#8208;pemedolac.

         <title>Integrated &#8220;Two&#8208;in&#8208;One&#8221; Strategy for High&#8208;Rate Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; catalyst, defective Bi modified by CrOx was developed for high&#8208;rate formate electrosynthesis through CO2 reduction. The defective Bi provides abundant active sites for CO2 adsorption, and the CrOx species promote the hydrogenation of CO2* to *OCHO by accelerating H2O dissociation to provide H*, which synergistically contributes to the high performance.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECR) is a promising pathway to producing valuable chemicals and fuels. Despite extensive studies reported, improving CO2 adsorption for local CO2 enrichment or water dissociation to generate sufficient H* is still not enough to achieve industrial&#8208;relevant current densities. Herein, we report a &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; catalyst, defective Bi nanosheets modified by CrOx (Bi&#8722;CrOx), to simultaneously promote CO2 adsorption and water dissociation, thereby enhancing the activity and selectivity of ECR to formate. The Bi&#8722;CrOx exhibits an excellent Faradaic efficiency (&#8776;100&#8201;%) in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.4 to &#8722;0.9&#8197;V. In addition, it achieves a remarkable formate partial current density of 687&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a moderate potential of &#8722;0.9&#8197;V without iR compensation, the highest value at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V reported so far. Control experiments and theoretical simulations revealed that the defective Bi facilitates CO2 adsorption/activation while the CrOx accounts for enhancing the protonation process via accelerating H2O dissociation. This work presents a pathway to boosting formate production through tuning CO2 and H2O species at the same time.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Driven Crosslinking Electrolytes for Fast Lithium&#8208;Ion Conduction and Solid&#8208;State Battery Applications</title>

A Li+&#8208;conducted coordination hypercrosslinked MOP (CHMOP&#8208;Li) polymer electrolyte was developed for high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state Li batteries, which is based on a cellulose&#8208;based copolymer with metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as the crosslinking agent. Benefiting from the advantages of MOPs and cellulose&#8208;based copolymers, the CHMOP&#8208;Li electrolytes exhibit both high ionic conductivity of 1.02&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and high Li+ transference number of 0.75 at 25 &#176;C. The solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries fabricated with CHMOP electrolyte show good cycling performance (500 cycles) and high discharge capacity (15740&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
Rechargeable batteries paired with lithium (Li) metal anodes are considered to be promising high&#8208;energy storage systems. However, the use of highly reactive Li metal and the formation of Li dendrites during battery operation would cause safety concerns, especially with the employment of highly flammable liquid electrolytes. Herein, a general strategy by engineering coordination&#8208;driven crosslinking networks is proposed to achieve high&#8208;performance solid polymer electrolytes. Through the coordination of metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) with cellulose&#8208;based copolymers, the Li+&#8208;conducted hypercrosslinked MOP (CHMOP&#8208;Li) polymer network is capable of enabling the rapid transport of Li+. In addition to the high Li+ conductivity (1.02&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C), CHMOP&#8208;Li electrolyte also exhibits a high Li+ transference number (0.75) and a wide electrochemical stability window. Benefiting from the thermally stable and mechanically strong CHMOP&#8208;Li electrolyte film, the short&#8208;circuiting of the symmetric batteries is prevented even after 3200&#8197;h of cycling and a high specific energy of 300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 is achieved for the Li&#8208;metal battery. The solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries fabricated with CHMOP&#8208;Li electrolyte also show good cycling performance (500 cycles) and high discharge capacity (15740&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). The proposed coordination&#8208;driven crosslinking strategies offer an alternative route to design high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation sustainable battery chemistries.

         <title>d&#8208;Electrons of Platinum Alloy Steering CO Pathway for Low&#8208;Charge Potential Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;solid co&#8208;oxidation of C and Li2CO3 is characterized by sluggish kinetics and unfavorable thermodynamics. Herein, the reaction pathway is successfully steered to a kinetically and thermodynamically favorable gas&#8208;solid reaction between CO and Li2CO3 by optimizing the Pt d&#8208;electron configuration. This strategy effectively improves the energy efficiency and cycle life of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.







Abstract
Aprotic Li&#8208;CO2 batteries suffer from sluggish solid&#8208;solid co&#8208;oxidation kinetics of C and Li2CO3, requiring extremely high charging potentials and leading to serious side reactions and poor energy efficiency. Herein, we introduce a novel approach to address these challenges by modulating the reaction pathway with tailored Pt d&#8208;electrons and develop an aprotic Li&#8208;CO2 battery with CO and Li2CO3 as the main discharge products. Note that the gas&#8208;solid co&#8208;oxidation reaction between CO and Li2CO3 is both kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable. Consequently, the Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with CoPt alloy&#8208;supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber (CoPt@NCNF) cathode exhibit a charging potential of 2.89&#8197;V at 50&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is the lowest charging potential to date. Moreover, the CoPt@NCNF cathode also shows exceptional cycling stability (218&#8197;cycles at 50&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and high energy efficiency up to 74.6&#8201;%. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the lowered d&#8208;band center of CoPt alloy effectively promotes CO desorption and inhibits further CO reduction to C. This work provides promising insights into developing efficient and CO&#8208;selective Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Static Organic p&#8208;n Junctions in Photoelectrodes for Solar Ammonia Production with 86&#8201;% Internal Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For molecular photoelectrodes, an organic p&#8208;n junction structure is reported which produces high&#8208;flux electrons under solar irradiation to drive efficient nitrate reduction to ammonia. With the p&#8208;n junction photoelectrode, the EQE and IQE for ammonia production are achieved at 57&#8201;% and 86&#8201;%, respectively. Our results represent an encouraging step forward in the design of robust organic photoelectrodes for solar&#8208;fuel production systems.







Abstract
For photoelectrocatalytic cells, a limitation exists in finding appropriate photoelectrode configurations that couple efficient extraction of high&#8208;energy electrons from absorbed photons and selective catalysis. Here we report an organic p&#8208;n junction approach to fabricate molecular photoelectrodes for conversion of solar energy and nitrate into valuable ammonia product. Solar irradiation of the photoelectrode generates charge&#8208;separated states with electrons and holes spatially separated at the n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type components, as revealed by surface photovoltage mapping, at a quantum yield of 90&#8201;%. The high&#8208;flux photogenerated electrons are rapidly transferred to the catalyst for solar ammonia production from nitrate reduction at an external quantum efficiency (EQE) and an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 57&#8201;% and 86&#8201;%, respectively. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic studies reveal that the large IQE originates from the combined high efficiencies for photoelectron generation, catalyst activation and dark catalysis. In a flow&#8208;cell setup coupled with a silicon solar cell, the photoelectrode without bias generates photocurrent of 57&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and ammonia at an EQE of 52&#8201;%.

         <title>A Membrane&#8208;Anchoring Self&#8208;Assembling Peptide Allows Bioorthogonal Coupling of Type&#8208;I AIEgens for Pyroptosis&#8208;Induced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>

We report an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cholecystokinin&#8208;2 receptor (CCK2R) dual&#8208;targeting peptide, which can self&#8208;assemble on the cancer cell membrane. The formed nanofibers can provide abundant &#8220;click&#8221; sites to enrich aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers on the cell membrane for type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy (PDT) to efficiently induce pyroptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD).







Abstract
Enrichment of photosensitizers (PSs) on cancer cell membranes via bioorthogonal reactions is considered to be a very promising therapeutic modality. However, azide&#8208;modified sugars&#8208;based metabolic labeling processes usually lack targeting and the labeling speed is relatively slow. Moreover, it has been rarely reported that membrane&#8208;anchoring pure type&#8208;I PSs can induce cancer cell pyroptosis. Here, we report an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cholecystokinin&#8208;2 receptor (CCK2R) dual&#8208;targeting peptide named DBCO&#8208;pYCCK6, which can selectively and rapidly self&#8208;assemble on cancer cell membrane, and then bioorthogonal enrich type&#8208;I aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgen) PSs (SAIE&#8208;N3) on the cell membrane. Upon light irradiation, the membrane&#8208;anchoring SAIE&#8208;N3 could effectively generate type&#8208;I reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the bioorthogonal combination strategy of peptide and AIEgen PSs could significantly inhibit tumor growth, which is accompanied by CD8+ cytotoxic T cell infiltration. This work provides a novel self&#8208;assembly peptide&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal reaction strategy to bridge the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and AIE field through strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) and elucidates that pure type&#8208;I membrane&#8208;anchoring PSs can be used for cancer therapy via GSDME&#8208;mediated pyroptosis.

In vivo experiments demonstrated that the bioorthogonal combination strategy of peptide and AIEgen PSs could significantly inhibit tumor growth, which is accompanied by CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cytotoxic T cell infiltration. This work provides a novel self-assembly peptide-mediated bioorthogonal reaction strategy to bridge the supramolecular self-assembly and AIE field through strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) and elucidates that pure type-I membrane-anchoring PSs can be used for cancer therapy via GSDME-mediated pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking Self&#8208;antioxidant Capability and Processability of Additive&#8208;free MXene Ink towards High&#8208;performance Customizable Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ oxyanion terminations permit MXene ink to exhibit remarkable self&#8208;antioxidant capability and processability in an aqueous solution, without any additives. This strategy can extend the shelf life of MXene to five months and enable the fabrication of high&#8208;performance, customizable supercapacitors through solution processing, unlocking its potential applications in flexible electronics.







Abstract
The solution processing of MXene ink is the feasible strategy to realize its state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications. Nevertheless, achieving high stability and processability of additive&#8208;free MXene ink is particularly challenging. Herein, we propose an oxyanion&#8208;terminated Ti3C2Tx MXene ink that exhibits excellent self&#8208;antioxidant capability and processability. The vertex&#8208;connected polyhedrons of oxyanions capping on the Ti3C2 host serve as an in situ antioxidative shield, effectively preventing the attack of free H2O molecules while increasing the robustness of the Ti&#8722;C bond and reducing the susceptibility of surface Ti atoms to oxidation. Consequently, the shelf life of MXene ink can be extended up to 5&#8197;months at room temperature. Moreover, the high electron accumulation of oxyanions enhances the interlayer interactions among MXene sheets through electrostatic binding, which enables the formation of stable and uniform MXene inks with controlled rheological properties and processability. Inspired by Chinese calligraphy, we utilize the oxyanion&#8208;terminated MXene ink to fabricate high&#8208;performance and customizable paper supercapacitors, which exhibit exceptional flexibility and stability, allowing them to be tailored to desired capacity, stretchability, and shapes. This in situ surface chemistry strategy of oxyanions can activate the self&#8208;antioxidant capability and solution processability of MXene, paving the way for its widespread applications in flexible and wearable electronics.

         <title>Stable Mono&#8208;Radical and Triplet Diradicals Based on Allylic Radical&#8208;Embedded All&#8208;Benzenoid Polycyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The derivative of an allylic radical&#8208;embedded all&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic hydrocarbon (dibenzo[fg,lm]heptacene) was synthesized, which showed high stability due to captodative effect and desired high&#8208;spin triplet ground state with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap.







Abstract
High&#8208;spin organic radicals are notable for their unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties, but synthesizing stable high&#8208;spin systems is challenging due to their inherent reactivity. This study presents a novel strategy for designing stable high&#8208;spin polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) by incorporating allylic radical into fused aromatic benzenoid rings. To enhance stability, large steric hindrance groups with a synergistic captodative effect were added to the allylic radical centers. This approach was applied to synthesize derivatives of two open&#8208;shell all&#8208;benzenoid PHs: benzo[fg]tetracene (1) and dibenzo[fg,lm]heptacene (2). Both compounds exhibited excellent stability, with diradical 2 showing a half&#8208;life of up to 17.2&#8197;days under ambient conditions. Bond length analysis and theoretical calculations suggest that 1 and 2 predominantly feature Clar's aromatic sextet structures with embedded allylic radicals. Compound 2 was confirmed to have a triplet ground state through DFT calculations and experimental methods, including pulse EPR spectroscopy and SQUID measurements. This work introduces a new design strategy for stable high&#8208;spin hydrocarbons, paving the way for future developments in high&#8208;spin organic materials.

         <title>Regulating the Spin&#8208;State of Cobalt in Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Iodine Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin state of Co is modulated by altering the oxidation state of the porphyrin&#8208;centered Co, achieving optimal catalysis for iodine reduction. The CoIII (with an S=0 spin ground state) coordinated three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D&#8208;COFs) effectively address the slow kinetics of I2 to NaI, resulting in large reversible capacities and superior high&#8208;rate cycling stability.







Abstract
Although the catalytic activity is heavily reliant on the electronic structure of the catalyst, understanding the impact of electron spin regulation on electrocatalytic performance is still rarely investigated. This work presents a novel approach involving the single&#8208;atom coordination of cobalt (Co) within metalloporphyrin&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D&#8208;COFs) to facilitate the catalytic conversion for sodium&#8208;iodine batteries. The spin state of Co is modulated by altering the oxidation state of the porphyrin&#8208;centered Co, achieving optimal catalysis for iodine reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that CoII and CoIII are incorporated into the 3D&#8208;COFs, exhibiting spin ground states of S=1/2 and S=0, respectively. The low spin state of CoIII is favorable to hybridize with the sp 3d orbitals of I3&#8722;, thus facilitating the conversion of I3&#8722; to I&#8722;. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the presence of CoIII enhances iodide adsorption and accelerates the formation of NaI in 3D&#8208;COFs&#8208;CoIII, thereby promoting its rapid kinetic behaviors. Notably, the I2@3D&#8208;COFs&#8208;CoIII cathode achieves a high reversible capacity of 227.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C and demonstrates exceptional cyclic stability, exceeding 2000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;C with a minor capacity fading rate of less than one 0.01&#8201;% per cycle.

         <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Silicon in Si3Cu3&#8722; Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations identified the global minimum structure of the 16&#8208;valence electron Si3Cu3&#8722; cluster, characterized by a planar tetracoordinate silicon atom within a rhombic framework of alternating Si3 and Cu3 units. The stability is reinforced by a delocalized 3&#8208;center 2&#8208;electron &#963;&#8208;bond in the Cu3 unit and a &#960;&#8208;bond within the Si3 framework. This study provides experimental confirmation of a planar hypercoordinate Group 14 element.







Abstract
Photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations have identified the global minimum structure of the 16&#8208;valence electron Si3Cu3&#8722; cluster, which features a planar tetracoordinate silicon (ptSi) in a rhombic arrangement. The Si3 and Cu3 triangles are interconnected by a Si2/Cu2 edge, forming an ordered chain&#8208;like structure. Besides the conventional 2c&#8211;2e &#963;&#8208;bond connecting Si3 and Cu3, the stability of this cluster is reinforced by a delocalized 3c&#8211;2e &#963;&#8208;bond in Cu3 and a &#960;&#8208;bond in Si3. Our study provides experimental confirmation of a planar hypercoordinate heavier Group 14 element, opening possibilities for exploring similar structures in two&#8208;dimensional materials.

Besides the conventional 2c&#8211;2e &#963;-bond connecting Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the stability of this cluster is reinforced by a delocalized 3c&#8211;2e &#963;-bond in Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and a &#960;-bond in Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Our study provides experimental confirmation of a planar hypercoordinate heavier Group 14 element, opening possibilities for exploring similar structures in two-dimensional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Investigating Competing Inner&#8208; and Outer&#8208;Sphere Electron&#8208;Transfer Pathways in Copper Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Atom&#8208;Transfer Radical Additions: Closing the Cycle</title>

This study examines the viability of competing inner&#8208;sphere (ISET) and outer&#8208;sphere electron transfer (OSET) processes in [Cu(dap)2]+&#8208;mediated atom&#8208;transfer radical additions of olefins and CF3SO2Cl that can deliver both R&#8722;SO2Cl and R&#8722;Cl products. R&#8722;SO2Cl/R&#8722;Cl product ratios are primarily governed by the relative rates of ground state direct catalyst regeneration {i.e., [Cu(dap)2SO2Cl]&#8901;++R&#8901;} and ligand exchange {i.e., [Cu(dap)2SO2Cl]&#8901;++Cl&#8722; }.







Abstract
This integrated computational and experimental study comprehensively examines the viability of competing inner&#8208;sphere electron transfer (ISET) and outer&#8208;sphere electron transfer (OSET) processes in [Cu(dap)2]+&#8208;mediated atom&#8208;transfer radical additions (ATRA) of olefins and CF3SO2Cl that can deliver both R&#8722;SO2Cl and R&#8722;Cl products. Five sterically&#8208; and electronically&#8208;varied representative alkenes were selected from which to explore and reconcile a range of experimentally observed outcomes. Findings are consistent with photoexcited [Cu(dap)2]+ initiating photoelectron transfer via ISET and the subsequent regeneration of the oxidized catalyst via ISET in the ground state to close the catalytic cycle and liberate products. R&#8722;SO2Cl/R&#8722;Cl product ratios appear to be primarily governed by the relative rates of direct catalyst regeneration {i.e., [Cu(dap)2SO2Cl]&#8901;++R&#8901;} and ligand exchange {i.e., [Cu(dap)2SO2Cl]&#8901;++Cl&#8722; }. Through this work, a more consistent and more complete conceptual framework has been developed to better understand this chemistry and how catalyst regeneration occurs. It is this important ground state process, which closes the catalytic cycle, and ultimately controls the enantioselectivity of ATRA reactions employing chiral copper photocatalysts.

         <title>Building Asymmetric Zn&#8722;N3 Bridge between 2D Photocatalyst and Co&#8208;catalyst for Directed Charge Transfer toward Efficient H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a strategy of forming asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3 units that can bridge nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped carbon layers with polymeric carbon nitride nanosheets (C3N4&#8722;Zn&#8722;N(C)). The symmetry&#8208;breaking Zn&#8722;N3 moiety, which has an asymmetric local charge distribution, enables directed and efficient interfacial charge transfer between the C3N4 photocatalyst and the N&#8208;doped carbon cocatalyst to achieve dramatically enhanced H2O2 photosynthesis activity.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymeric semiconductors are a class of promising photocatalysts; however, it remains challenging to facilitate their interlayer charge transfer for suppressed in&#8208;plane charge recombination and thus improved quantum efficiency. Although some strategies, such as &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and van der Waals interaction, have been developed so far, directed interlayer charge transfer still cannot be achieved. Herein, we report a strategy of forming asymmetric Zn&#8722;N3 units that can bridge nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped carbon layers with polymeric carbon nitride nanosheets (C3N4&#8722;Zn&#8722;N(C)) to address this challenge. The symmetry&#8208;breaking Zn&#8722;N3 moiety, which has an asymmetric local charge distribution, enables directed interfacial charge transfer between the C3N4 photocatalyst and the N&#8208;doped carbon co&#8208;catalyst. As evidenced by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, charge separation can be significantly enhanced by the interfacial asymmetric Zn&#8722;N3 bonding bridges. As a result, the designed C3N4&#8722;Zn&#8722;N(C) catalyst exhibits dramatically enhanced H2O2 photosynthesis activity, outperforming most of the reported C3N4&#8208;based catalysts. This work highlights the importance of tailoring interfacial chemical bonding channels in polymeric photocatalysts at the molecular level to achieve effective spatial charge separation.

         <title>An Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Supramolecular Modulator Enhancing Autophagy to Prevent Ventricular Arrhythmias Post&#8208;Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasound&#8208;activated Ru(II) supramolecular sonosensitizer, RuB, was developed to modulate ventricular arrhythmias. In vitro and in vivo results demonstrated RuB mediated US modulation effectively enhanced pro&#8208;survival autophagy in BV2 cells, thereby prevented ventricular arrhythmias.







Abstract
Ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) triggered by myocardial infarction (MI) are the leading cause of sudden cardiac mortality worldwide. Current therapeutic strategies for managing MI&#8208;induced VAs, such as left stellate ganglion resection and ablation, are suboptimal, highlighting the need to explore safer and more effective intervention strategies. Herein, we rationally designed two supramolecular sonosensitizers RuA and RuB, engineered through acceptor modification to generate moderate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to modulate VAs. Both RuA and RuB demonstrated high ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated ROS production efficiency, with singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yield (&#934;&#916;) of 0.70 and 0.88, respectively, surpassing ligand IR1105 and the conventional sonosensitizer ICG (&#934;&#916;=0.40). In vitro, RuB, at a modest concentration and under US intensity notably boosts pro&#8208;survival autophagy in microglia BV2&#8197;cell. To improve in vivo stability and biocompatibility, RuB was further encapsulated into DSPE&#8208;PEG5000 to prepare RuB nanoparticles (RuB NPs). In vivo studies after microinjection of RuB NPs into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and subsequent US exposure, demonstrated that RuB NPs&#8208;mediated US modulation effectively suppresses sympathetic nervous activity (SNA) and inflammatory responses, thereby preventing VAs. Importantly, no tissue injury was observed post RuB NPs&#8208;mediated US modulation. This work pioneers the design of long&#8208;wave emission supramolecular sonosensitizers, offering new insights into regulating cardiovascular diseases.

         <title>Marine Amoebae&#8208;Inspired Salting Hydrogels to Reconfigure Anisotropy for Reprogrammable Shape Morphing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to osmotic pressure, marine amoebae swell in freshwater and deswell in high salinity seawater. Inspired by this, protonation/deprotonation transition was synergized with osmotic pressure to allow polyampholyte hydrogels to swell&#8208;reswell&#8208;deswell upon successive immersion in HCl/NaCl solution and water. Swelling&#8208;reswelling&#8208;deswelling of reconfigurable patterned zones enables reprogrammable shape morphing of hydrogels.







Abstract
Reprogrammable shape morphing is ubiquitous in living beings and highly crucial for them to move in normal situations, even to survive under dangerous conditions. There is increasing interest in using asymmetric hydrogel structures to understand and mimic living beings&#8217; shape morphing upon an external trigger in a controlled way. However, these asymmetric or heterogeneous configurations cannot be further modified once the polymer hydrogels are prepared. Therefore, it is a great challenge to achieve reprogrammable shape morphing using the existing hydrogels. Inspired by marine amoebae, which transform into several different morphologies according to the various external salt concentrations, a new strategy is developed for salting hydrogels to reconfigure their anisotropy toward reprogrammable shape morphing. Polyampholyte hydrogels with equal stoichiometric COO&#8722; and N+(CH3)3 groups were first swollen in HCl/NaCl solution. After being then transferred into water, they first swollen again by water uptake driven by the osmotic pressure, and then were spontaneously deswollen due to increase in internal pH and dialysis of ions leading to deprotonation of COOH to COO&#8722; and regeneration of COO&#8722;/N+(CH3)3 electrostatic attraction. This work provides a novel strategy to reconfigure anisotropy of hydrogel soft actuators and to open up an avenue for reprogrammable shape morphing.

&lt;p&gt;Due to osmotic pressure, marine amoebae swell in freshwater and deswell in high salinity seawater. Inspired by this, protonation/deprotonation transition was synergized with osmotic pressure to allow polyampholyte hydrogels to swell-reswell-deswell upon successive immersion in HCl/NaCl solution and water. Swelling-reswelling-deswelling of reconfigurable patterned zones enables reprogrammable shape morphing of hydrogels.

         <title>Chiral Au@CeO2 Helical Nanorods with Spatially Separated Structures for Polarization&#8208;Dependent N2 Photofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the successful development of chiral Au@CeO2 HNRs featuring spatially separated structures, achieved via a wet&#8208;chemistry approach. This advancement significantly boosts the photocatalytic efficiency of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials and highlights their promising application in N2 photofixation when stimulated by circularly polarized light.







Abstract
Chiral photocatalytic nanomaterials possess numerous unique properties and hold promise for various applications in chemical synthesis, environmental protection, energy conversion, and photoelectric devices. Nevertheless, it is uncommon to develop effective means to enhance the asymmetric catalytic performances of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials. In this study, a type of L/D&#8208;Au@CeO2 helical nanorods (HNRs) was fabricated by selectively growing CeO2 on the surface of Au HNRs via a facile wet&#8208;chemistry construction method. Chiral Au@CeO2 HNRs, featuring Au and CeO2 with spatially separated structures, exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance for N2 fixation, being 50.80&#177;2.64&#8197;times greater than that of Au HNRs. Furthermore, when L&#8208;Au@CeO2 HNRs were exposed to left circularly polarized light (CPL) and D&#8208;Au@CeO2 HNRs were exposed to right CPL, their photocatalytic efficiency was enhanced by 3.06&#177;0.06&#8197;times compared to the samples illuminated with the opposite CPL, which can be attributed to the asymmetrical generation of hot carriers upon CPL excitation. This study not only offers a simple approach to enhance the photocatalytic performance of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials but also demonstrates the potential of chiral plasmonic materials for application in specific photocatalytic reactions, such as N2 fixation.

         <title>Metal&#8208;N Coordination in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries: Inhibiting Catalyst Passivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni catalyst readily react with S8 to form NiSx compounds on the surface, leading to catalyst passivation and slows down kinetics of LiPSs conversion. Conversely, Ni&#8722;N coordination catalyst, usually as Ni&#8722;N4, offers effective passivation resistance and rapid LiPSs conversion kinetics. Preventing S passivation in M&#8722;N coordination applies not only to Ni&#8722;N4 but also to various transition metals and coordination numbers of N.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries exhibit great potential as the next&#8208;generation energy storage techniques. Application of catalyst is widely adopted to accelerate the redox kinetics of polysulfide conversion reactions and improve battery performance. Although significant attention has been devoted to seeking new catalysts, the problem of catalyst passivation remains underexplored. Herein, we find that metal&#8208;N coordination has a previously overlooked role in preventing the catalyst passivation. In the case of nickel, the Ni catalyst reacts with S8 to produce NiSx compounds on the surface, leading to catalyst passivation and slow the kinetics of LiPSs conversion. In contrast, when Ni is coordinated with N (typically Ni&#8722;N4), S8 remains stable on the surface. The Ni&#8722;N4 exhibits excellent resistance to passivation and rapid kinetics of LiPSs conversion. Consequently, the sulfur cathode with Ni&#8722;N4 exhibits a high rate capability of 604.11&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3&#8197;C and maintains a low capacity decay rate of 0.046&#8201;% per cycle over 1000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C. Furthermore, preventing S passivation in M&#8722;N coordination applies not only to Ni&#8722;N4 but also to various coordination numbers and transition metals. This study reveals a new aspect of metal&#8208;N coordination in inhibiting catalyst passivation, improving our understanding of catalysts in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Shotgun Sequencing of 512&#8208;mer Copolyester Allows Random Access to Stored Information</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated shotgun sequencing of 512 repeating unit sequence&#8208;defined polymers with a molecular weight (57.3&#8197;kDa) far exceeding the analysis limit of mass spectrometry. Chemically activated fragmentation code was employed to generate MS&#8208;compatible oligomers. Shotgun sequencing also allowed random access to the stored information.







Abstract
Digital information encoded in polymers has been exclusively decoded by mass spectrometry. However, the size limit of analytes in mass spectrometry restricts the storage capacity per chain. In addition, sequential decoding hinders random access to the bits of interest without full&#8208;chain sequencing. Here we report the shotgun sequencing of a 512&#8208;mer sequence&#8208;defined polymer whose molecular weight (57.3&#8197;kDa) far exceeds the analytical limit of mass spectrometry. A 4&#8208;bit fragmentation code was implemented at aperiodic positions during the synthetic encoding of 512&#8208;bit information without affecting storage capacity per chain. Upon activating the fragmentation code, the polymer chain splits into 18 oligomers, which could be individually decoded by tandem&#8208;mass sequencing. These sequences were computationally reconstructed into a full sequence using an error&#8208;detection method. The proposed sequencing method eliminates the storage limit of a single polymer chain and allows random access to the bits of interest without full&#8208;chain sequencing.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fused Star&#8208;Shape Giant Trimer Electron Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency over 19&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;fused skeleton strategy has developed novel non&#8208;fused star&#8208;shaped trimer, which has significantly improved solubility and synthetic yield, and effectively inhibited excessive molecular aggregation. The resulting based on 3BTT6F exhibit superior photovoltaic performance. Importantly, the non&#8208;fused 3D skeleton is conducive to improving intermolecular interactions, thereby contributing to the exceptional stability of the binary devices.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on giant molecular acceptors (GMAs) have attracted extensive attention due to their excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operation stability. However, the large conjugated plane of GMAs poses great challenges in regulating the solubility, over&#8208;size aggregation and yield, which in turn further constrains their development in commercial products. Herein, we employ a non&#8208;fused skeleton strategy to develop novel non&#8208;fused star&#8208;shape trimers (3BTT6F and 3BTT6Cl) for improving device performance. Single&#8208;bond linkage can break the rigid planarity to form a 3D architecture, generating multidimensional charge transfer pathways. Importantly, the non&#8208;fused skeleton strategy can not only significantly improve solubility and synthesis yield, but also effectively suppress molecular excessive aggregation. Consequently, due to the optimized film&#8208;forming process and charge dynamics, 3BTT6F&#8208;based binary device obtains a high PCE of 17.52&#8201;%, which is significantly higher than the reported fully fused trimers. Excitingly, 3BTT6F&#8208;based ternary device even obtains a top&#8208;level PCE of 19.26&#8201;%. Furthermore, the non&#8208;fused star&#8208;shape configuration also endows these acceptors with enhanced intermolecular interaction in the active layer, demonstrating excellent operational stability. Our work emphasizes the potential of non&#8208;fused star&#8208;shape trimers, providing a new pathway for achieving highly efficient and stable OSCs.

&lt;p&gt;The non-fused skeleton strategy has developed novel non-fused star-shaped trimer, which has significantly improved solubility and synthetic yield, and effectively inhibited excessive molecular aggregation. The resulting based on 3BTT6F exhibit superior photovoltaic performance. Importantly, the non-fused 3D skeleton is conducive to improving intermolecular interactions, thereby contributing to the exceptional stability of the binary devices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on giant molecular acceptors (GMAs) have attracted extensive attention due to their excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operation stability. However, the large conjugated plane of GMAs poses great challenges in regulating the solubility, over-size aggregation and yield, which in turn further constrains their development in commercial products. Herein, we employ a non-fused skeleton strategy to develop novel non-fused star-shape trimers (3BTT6F and 3BTT6Cl) for improving device performance. Single-bond linkage can break the rigid planarity to form a 3D architecture, generating multidimensional charge transfer pathways. Importantly, the non-fused skeleton strategy can not only significantly improve solubility and synthesis yield, but also effectively suppress molecular excessive aggregation. Consequently, due to the optimized film-forming process and charge dynamics, 3BTT6F-based binary device obtains a high PCE of 17.52&#8201;%, which is significantly higher than the reported fully fused trimers. Excitingly, 3BTT6F-based ternary device even obtains a top-level PCE of 19.26&#8201;%. Furthermore, the non-fused star-shape configuration also endows these acceptors with enhanced intermolecular interaction in the active layer, demonstrating excellent operational stability. Our work emphasizes the potential of non-fused star-shape trimers, providing a new pathway for achieving highly efficient and stable OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Override the intrinsic preference of regioselectivity. An enantioselective nickel&#8208;catalyzed syn&#8208;hydrometalative 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of 1,4&#8208;alkynones is reported to access alkenyl cyclobutanols. A carbonyl&#8208;directed hydrometalation step is the key to override the intrinsic electronic effect guided regioselectivity. The products are demonstrated to readily advance to enantioenriched three&#8208;dimensional bioisosteres.







Abstract
Enantioselective synthesis of (spiro)cyclobutane derivatives poses significant challenges yet holds promising applications for both synthetic and medicinal chemistry. We report here a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric syn&#8208;hydrometalative 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of 1,4&#8208;alkynones to synthesize alkenyl cyclobutanols with a tetrasubstituted stereocenter. This strategy features a broad substrate scope, delivering a variety of trifluoromethyl&#8208;containing rigid (spiro)carbocycle skeletons in good yields with high enantioselectivities (up to 84&#8201;% yield and 98.5&#8201;:&#8201;1.5 er). The synthetic utility is demonstrated through stereospecific transformations into fused spiro molecules. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction is initiated by an active Ni&#8722;H species, with carbonyl&#8208;directed hydrometalation as the key for regioselective control. This catalytic method provides a general solution for regioselective hydrofunctionalization of alkynes and represents an efficient reaction pattern for assembling highly strained enantioenriched bioisosteres.

         <title>Stereocontrolled Hydrogenation of Conjugated Enones to Alcohols via Dual Iridium&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereocontrolled hydrogenation of ketones by dual iridium catalysis was demonstrated. The finding that N,P&#8722;Ir (active towards alkenes) and NHC,P&#8722;Ir (active towards ketones) can perform the asymmetric hydrogenation under the same conditions (solvent, pH, hydrogen source) while exhibited complementary chemoselectivity was key to the development of this methodology. By simple choice of chirality on each iridium complex, each stereoisomer of the alcohol could separately be prepared with precise control over the absolute stereochemistry.







Abstract
The concept of dual catalysis is an emerging area holding high potential in terms of preparative efficiency, yet faces severe challenges in compatibility of reaction conditions and interference of catalysts. The transition&#8208;metal catalyzed stereoselective hydrogenation of olefins and ketones typically proceeds under different reaction conditions and/or uses a different reductant. As a result, these two types of hydrogenations can normally not be performed in the same pot. Herein, the stereocontrolled hydrogenation of enones to saturated alcohols is described, enabled by orthogonal dual iridium catalysis, using molecular hydrogen for both reductions. In this one&#8208;pot procedure, N,P&#8208;iridium catalysts (hydrogenation active towards olefins) and NHC,P&#8208;iridium catalysts (hydrogenation active towards ketones) operated independently of one another allowing the construction of two contiguous stereogenic centers up to 99&#8201;% ee, 99/1 d.r. Ultimately, by simple selection of the chirality of either ligands, the enone could be efficiently reduced to all four stereoisomers of the saturated alcohol in equally high stereopurity. This degree of stereocontrol for the synthesis of different stereoisomers by dual transition&#8208;metal catalyzed hydrogenation was previously not attained. The generality in substituted enones (alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl) demonstrate the wide applicability of this concept.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Stabilized Single CoN4Cl2 Site Boosts Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction into Tunable Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique Co&#8722;N4Cl2 single&#8208;site was fabricated on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) via molecule modulation and exhibited high efficiency in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 conversion into syngas, showing a high production rate, TON, and TOF. The triazine&#8208;based COF framework promotes the charge kinetics and the single Co&#8722;N4Cl2 site strengthens the CO2 activation by reducing the activation energy towards the key intermediate *COOH.







Abstract
Solar carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction provides an attractive alternative to producing sustainable chemicals and fuel. However, the construction of a highly active photocatalyst was challenging because of the rapid charge recombination and sluggish surface CO2 reduction. Herein, a unique Co&#8722;N4Cl2 single site was fabricated by loading Co species into the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and triazine&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (COF) for CO2 conversion into syngas under visible light irradiation. The resulting champion catalyst TPy&#8208;COF&#8208;Co enabled a record&#8208;high CO production rate of 426&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, associated with the unprecedented turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) of 2095 and 1607&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively. The catalyst also exhibited favorable recycling performance and widely adjustable syngas production (CO/H2 ratio: 1.8&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8211;1&#8201;:&#8201;16). A systematical investigation including operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, in situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS), and theoretical calculation indicated that the triazine&#8208;based COF framework promoted the charge transfer towards the single Co&#8722;N4Cl2 sites that greatly promoted the CO2 activation by lowering the energy barrier of *COOH generation, facilitating the CO2 transformation. This work highlights the great potential of the molecular regulation of COF&#8208;derived single&#8208;atom catalysts to boost CO2 photoreduction efficiency.

A unique Ag&#8722;Ru dual active center alloying strategy was employed to synthesize the CoCuFeAgRu HEA using MOF&#8208;assisted preparation. Remarkably, the resulting HEA catalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic performance, and the assembled flexible rechargeable ZAB also demonstrated exceptional performance at ultra&#8208;low temperatures of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, with a cycle stability of up to 1,650&#8197;hours. This study presents a novel approach for advancing efficient bifunctional catalysis of HEAs.







Abstract
The development of advanced bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is significant for rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a unique dual active center alloying strategy is proposed to achieve the efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysis, and the high entropy effect is further exploited to modulate the structure and performance of the catalysts. The MOF&#8208;assisted pyrolysis&#8208;replacement&#8208;alloying method was employed to construct the CoCuFeAgRu high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA), which are uniformly anchored in porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets.

&lt;p&gt;A unique Ag&#8722;Ru dual active center alloying strategy was employed to synthesize the CoCuFeAgRu HEA using MOF-assisted preparation. Remarkably, the resulting HEA catalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic performance, and the assembled flexible rechargeable ZAB also demonstrated exceptional performance at ultra-low temperatures of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, with a cycle stability of up to 1,650&#8197;hours. This study presents a novel approach for advancing efficient bifunctional catalysis of HEAs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of advanced bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is significant for rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a unique dual active center alloying strategy is proposed to achieve the efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysis, and the high entropy effect is further exploited to modulate the structure and performance of the catalysts. The MOF-assisted pyrolysis-replacement-alloying method was employed to construct the CoCuFeAgRu high-entropy alloy (HEA), which are uniformly anchored in porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets. Notably, the obtained HEA catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance for both ORR and OER, and a peak power density of 136. 53&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and an energy density of 987.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;Zn&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing the most of the previously reported bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. Moreover, the assembled flexible rechargeable ZAB enables excellent performance even at the ultralow temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, with an energy density of 601.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;Zn&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and remarkable cycling stability up to 1,650&#8197;hours. Combined experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the excellent bifunctional catalytic activity of the HEA catalyst originated from the synergistic effect of the Ag and Ru dual active centers, and the optimization of the electronic structure by alloying effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Exploring efficient formation mechanisms, as well as self&#8208;renewing solid electrolyte interfaces, is essential for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This paper proposes a novel and straightforward method for forming the interface, introducing an organic&#8211;inorganic composite solid&#8208;to&#8208;gel electrolyte layer with high mechanical performance. The self&#8208;renovating mechanism is also discussed, which may accelerate the practical application of self&#8208;renovating interface in the field of zinc&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
The aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIB) have emerged as a promising technology in the realm of electrochemical energy storage. Despite its potential advantages in terms of safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and inherent safety, AZIB faces significant challenges. Issues attributed to unsupported thermodynamics and non&#8208;uniform potential distribution and deposition, present formidable obstacles that necessitate resolution. To tackle these challenges, a novel strategy adapting hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic in&#8197;situ derived solid&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogel electrolyte interface (StHEI) has been developed from coordination reactions and self&#8208;respiratory process, establishing uniform diffusion channels by ion bridges and accelerating ion transport. Self&#8208;respiratory pattern of StHEI realized through in&#8197;situ inorganic component conversion further prolongs the protecting duration, which effectively mitigates corrosion and passivation but enhance the mechanical properties of the StHEI measured through Young's modulus. This novel StHEI promotes well&#8208;distributed potential lines within the Helmholtz regions. Zn2+ are finally induced to deposit and nucleate in a compact, fine, and uniform manner. Asymmetrical batteries assembled with the modified Zn electrode and bare Zn exhibit exceptional stability over 3000&#8197;h (1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8211;0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The asymmetrical Cu//Zn cell achieved an outstanding average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6&#8201;% over 1200&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Simultaneous Regulation of Organic and Inorganic Components in Interphase by Fiber Separator for High&#8208;Stable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidized cellulose separator provides strong dipole moments, facilitating the cleavage of P&#8722;F bonds to construct a solid electrolyte interphase rich in NaF. In addition, the separator prevents the reduction of organic solvents by attracting electrons, thereby inhibiting the formation of organic oligomers. Thus, it results in a smooth and robust interphase, which significantly reduces the interface impedance of the Na anode.







Abstract
Uncontrollable side reactions at the metal interface have been identified as the root cause of the formation of a fragile solid electrolyte interphase, leading to irreversible sodium loss in sodium metal batteries. Here, we proposed an interface engineering strategy that employed a carboxyl functionalized cellulose separator to provide strong dipole moments and induce the cleavage of P&#8722;F bond to construct a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) rich in NaF. In addition, we employed nuclear magnetic resonance technology confirmed that the separator with strong dipole moments prevented the reduction of organic solvents by attracting electrons, thereby inhibiting the formation of organic oligomers. SEI with high NaF content and few oligomers is smooth and robust, obviously decreasing the interface impedance of the Na anode. The symmetric Na||Na cells, equipped with the functionalized separator, efficiently operated for 1400&#8197;hours with a stable 72&#8197;mV overpotential at 0.25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, exhibiting low energy barrier and fast ion transport kinetics. The Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cell also showed stable cycling performance, with the capacity remaining at 94.83&#8201;% of the initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 1C. The proposed separator could control the formation and composition of SEI, paving the way for the development of long&#8208;life sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Triple Regulations via Fe Redox Boosting Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia at Industrial Current Densities</title>

The performance of low&#8208;valence Fe doped Ni2P toward NO3&#8722;RR to NH3 is significantly enhanced via the three regulations of Fe through bypassing the rate&#8208;determining NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; step, reducing the NO2&#8722; to NH3 reaction energy barrier, and prohibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) has promising prospects for green synthesis of ammonia and environmental remediation. However, the performance of catalysts at high current density usually suffers from the high energy barrier for the nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to nitrite (NO2&#8722;) and the competitive hydrogen evolution. Herein, we proposed a two&#8208;step relay mechanism through spontaneous redox reaction followed electrochemical reaction by introducing low&#8208;valence Fe species into Ni2P nanosheets to significantly enhance the NO3&#8722;RR performance at industrial current density. The existence of low&#8208;valence Fe species bypasses the NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; step through the spontaneous redox with NO3&#8722; to produce NO2&#8722; and Fe2O3, regulates the electronic structure of Ni2P to reduce the barrier of NO2&#8722; to NH3, thirdly prohibits the hydrogen evolution by consuming the excess active hydrogen through reduction of Fe2O3 to recover low&#8208;valence Fe species. The triple regulations via Fe redox during the two&#8208;step relay reactions guarantee the Fe&#8208;Ni2P@NF high ammonia yield of 120.1&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with Faraday efficiency of more than 90% over a wide potential window and a long&#8208;term stability of more than 130 h at ~1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides a new strategy to realize the design and synthesis of nitrate reduction electrocatalysts at high current densities.

         <title>MicroRNA&#8208;Triggered Programmable DNA&#8208;Encoded Pre&#8208;PROTACs for Cell&#8208;Selective and Controlled Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phototunable miRNA&#8208;initiated assembled pre&#8208;PROTAC (miRiaTAC) platform is developed to achieve on&#8208;demand activation and termination of targeted protein degradation in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. This modular scaffold capitalizes on the programmability of DNA assembly for dynamic regulation of diverse miRiaTACs for enhanced cancer therapy.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have accelerated drug development; however, some challenges still exist owing to their lack of tumor selectivity and on&#8208;demand protein degradation. Here, we developed a miRNA&#8208;initiated assembled pre&#8208;PROTAC (miRiaTAC) platform that enables the on&#8208;demand activation and termination of target degradation in a cell type&#8208;specific manner. Using miRNA&#8208;21 as a model, we engineered DNA hairpins labeled with JQ&#8208;1 and pomalidomide and facilitated the modular assembly of DNA&#8208;encoded pre&#8208;PROTACs through a hybridization chain reaction. This configuration promoted the selective polyubiquitination and degradation of BRD4 upon miR&#8208;21 initiation, highlighting significant tumor selectivity and minimal systemic toxicity. Furthermore, the platform incorporates photolabile groups, enabling the precise optical control of pre&#8208;PROTACs during DNA assembly/disassembly, mitigating the risk of excessive protein degradation. Additionally, by introducing a secondary ligand targeting CDK6, these pre&#8208;PROTACs were used as a modular scaffold for the programmable assembly of active miRiaTACs containing two different warheads in exact stoichiometry, enabling orthogonal multitarget degradation. The integration of near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy through an upconversion nanosystem further enhanced the efficacy of the platform with potent in vivo anticancer activity. We anticipate that miRiaTAC represents a significant intersection between dynamic DNA nanotechnology and PROTAC, potentially expanding the versatility of PROTAC toolkit for cancer therapy.

         <title>Oxygen Plasma Triggered Co&#8722;O&#8722;Fe Motif in Prussian Blue Analogue for Efficient and Robust Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable Co&#8722;O&#8722;Fe local motifs can be constructed in CoFe Prussian blue analogues by oxygen plasma treatment, realizing the oxygen evolution pathway from traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism to lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism, which successfully balances the activity and stability for the industrial&#8208;level current density alkaline water oxidation.







Abstract
In the context of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the construction of high&#8208;valence transition metal sites to trigger the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is considered crucial for overcoming the performance limitations of traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism. However, the dynamic evolution of lattice oxygen during the reaction poses significant challenges for the stability of high&#8208;valence metal sites, particularly in high&#8208;current&#8208;density water&#8208;splitting systems. Here, we have successfully constructed Co&#8722;O&#8722;Fe catalytic active motifs in cobalt&#8208;iron Prussian blue analogs (CoFe&#8208;PBA) through oxygen plasma bombardment, effectively activating lattice oxygen reactivity while sustaining robust stability. Our spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal that the Co&#8722;O&#8722;Fe bridged motifs enable a unique double&#8208;exchange interaction between Co and Fe atoms, promoting the formation of high&#8208;valence Co species as OER active centers while maintaining Fe in a low&#8208;valence state, preventing its dissolution. The resultant catalyst (CoFe&#8208;PBA&#8208;30) requires an overpotential of only 276&#8197;mV to achieve 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the assembled alkaline exchange membrane electrolyzer using CoFe&#8208;PBA&#8208;30 as anode material achieves a high current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.76&#8197;V and continuously operates for 250&#8197;hours with negligible degradation. This work provides significant insights for activating lattice oxygen redox without compromising structure stability in practical water electrolyzers.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Alkynyl Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynyl amides are important components in organic synthesis of bioactive compounds and valuable heterocycles. General and efficient syntheses without transition&#8208;metals under mild and simple conditions are rare. Introduced are transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot syntheses of alkynyl amide that make the alkyne triple bond from chemical feedstocks. These innovative methods significantly reduce costs and enhance the sustainability of alkynyl amide syntheses.







Abstract
Alkynyl amides play crucial roles in organic synthesis in the production of bioactive compounds and valuable heterocycles. Despite numerous studies on their synthesis, challenges persist due to the necessity of harsh or hazardous conditions and the use of costly or unstable reagents. Herein, we present a one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of all three bonds of the alkyne under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. An important feature of this chemistry is the use of readily available feedstock chemicals, such as methyl esters and acetamides. This approach offers efficient access to a wide range of aryl and alkyl alkynyl amides and demonstrates excellent tolerance towards various functional groups in a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective manner.

         <title>End&#8208;Extended Conjugation Strategy to Reduce the Efficiency&#8208;Stability&#8208;Mechanical Robustness Gap in Binary All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing the end&#8208;extended conjugation strategy, high efficiency, excellent thermal stability, and outstanding mechanical robustness of APSCs are simultaneously achieved. These devices maintain 90&#8201;% of their initial PCE for 1500&#8197;h at 65&#8201;&#176;C, exhibit a high COS value of 24.1&#8201;%, and achieve a record&#8208;breaking PCE of 19.12&#8201;% (certified at 18.45&#8201;%).







Abstract
Concurrently achieving high efficiency, mechanical robustness and thermal stability is critical for the commercialization of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (APSCs). However, APSCs usually demonstrate complicated morphology, primarily attributed to the polymer chain entanglement which has a detrimental effect on their fill factors (FF) and morphology stability. To address these concerns, an end&#8208;group extended polymer acceptor, PY&#8208;NFT, was synthesized and studied. The morphology analysis showed a tightly ordered molecular packing mode and a favorable phase separation was formed. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;NFT&#8208;based device achieved an exceptional PCE of 19.12&#8201;% (certified as 18.45&#8201;%), outperforming the control PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;FT devices (17.14&#8201;%). This significant improvement highlights the record&#8208;high PCE for binary APSCs. The thermal aging study revealed that the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;NFT blend exhibited excellent morphological stability, thereby achieving superior device stability, retaining 90&#8201;% of initial efficiency after enduring thermal stress (65&#8201;&#176;C) for 1500&#8197;hours. More importantly, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;NFT blend film exhibited outstanding mechanical ductility with a crack onset strain of 24.1&#8201;%. Overall, rational chemical structure innovation, especially the conjugation extension strategy to trigger appropriate phase separation and stable morphology, is the key to achieving high efficiency, improved thermal stability and robust mechanical stability of APSCs.

Single&#8208;component, discrete self&#8208;immolative photoresists with precisely defined chain lengths are engineered as dual&#8208;tone patterning materials suitable for both electron beam and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. These discrete photoresists showcase a chain length&#8208;dependent lithographic performance, resulting in well&#8208;delineated patterns with superior resolution and reduced line edge roughness (LER) when compared to their disperse counterparts.







Abstract
Electron beam (EB) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography are advanced techniques capable of achieving sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm resolutions, critical for fabricating next&#8208;generation nanostructures and semiconductor devices. However, developing EUV photoresists that meet all demands for resolution, line edge roughness (LER), and sensitivity (RLS) remains a significant challenge. Herein, we introduce high&#8208;performance photoresists based on single&#8208;component self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) with inherent signal amplification via cascade degradation. These SIPs function as dual&#8208;tone photoresists under both EB and EUV lithography, with performance primarily determined by the exposure dose. Lithographic evaluations show that discrete SIPs provide significant improvements over disperse counterparts, achieving higher resolution and reduced LER. Specifically, a discrete SIP with a DP of 12 produces a line&#8208;space pattern with a resolution of approximately 18&#8197;nm and an LER of 1.8&#8197;nm, compared to 21&#8197;nm resolution and 2.5&#8197;nm LER for disperse SIPs. Additionally, these SIP&#8208;based photoresists, enriched with aromatic structures, exhibit excellent etch resistance. The single&#8208;component nature and potential to address the RLS trade&#8208;off underscore the promise of discrete SIPs for EUV lithography.

         <title>Organic Materials with Ultrabright Phosphorescence at Room Temperature under Physiological Conditions for Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The record NIR/red phosphorescence intensity of nanoparticles under physiological conditions has been achieved by four&#8208;branched luminogens with shielding effect toward oxygen and water. It can penetrate tissue with depth as high as 35&#8197;mm, resulting in the clear in vivo phosphorescence imaging of the liver, tumor, and stomach in living mice, and lymph nodes in living rabbits with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios.







Abstract
In contrast to the high efficiency of room temperature phosphorescence in crystal states, the generally utilized nanoparticles of organic materials in bioimaging demonstrated sharply decreased performance by orders of magnitude under physiological conditions, badly limiting the realization of their unique advantages. This case, especially for organic red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescence materials, is not only the challenge present in reality but more importantly, for the theoretical problem of deeply understanding and avoiding the quenching effect by oxygen and water toward excited triplet states. Herein, thanks to the intelligent molecular design by the introduction of abundant hydrophobic chains and highly&#8208;branched structures, bright and persistent red/NIR phosphorescence under physiological conditions has been realized, which demonstrated the shielding effect towards oxygen, and the strengthened intermolecular interactions to suppress the non&#8208;radiative transitions. Accordingly, the record phosphorescence intensity of nanoparticles in bioimage, up to 8.21&#177;0.36&#215;108&#8197;p&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;sr&#8722;1, was achieved, to realize the clear phosphorescence imaging of liver and tumors in living mice, even lymph nodes in rabbit models with high SBRs. This work afforded an efficient way to achieve the bright red/NIR phosphorescence nanoparticles, guiding their further applications in biology and medicine.

         <title>Meso/Microporous Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Featuring Curved Fe&#8722;N4 Sites Boost the Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ZnO&#8208;assisted ZIF derivation approach is developed to synthesize an atomically dispersed meso/microporous Fe&#8722;N/C catalyst with curved Fe&#8722;N4 active sites onto the tubular carbon walls, showing excellent oxygen reduction performance in both acidic and alkaline media. When used in proton exchange membrane fuel cells and Zn&#8208;air batteries, it demonstrates outstanding cell/battery performance.







Abstract
Zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are among the most efficient precursors for the synthesis of atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N/C materials, which are promising catalysts for enhancing the performance of Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) and proton exchange fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, existing ZIF&#8208;derived Fe&#8722;N/C electrocatalysts mostly consist of microporous materials, leading to insufficient mass transport and inadequate battery/cell performance. In this study, we synthesize an atomically dispersed meso/microporous Fe&#8722;N/C material with curved Fe&#8722;N4 active sites, denoted as FeSA&#8722;N/TC, through the pyrolysis of hemin&#8208;modified ZIF films on ZnO nanorods, obtained from the self&#8208;assembly reaction between Zn2+ from ZnO hydrolysis and 2&#8208;methylimidazole. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the curved Fe&#8722;N4 active sites can weaken the intermediate adsorptions, resulting in lower free energy barriers and enhanced performance during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Specifically, FeSA&#8722;N/TC exhibits exceptional ORR performance with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.925&#8197;V in alkaline media and 0.825&#8197;V in acidic media. When used as the cathodic catalyst in PEMFCs and ZABs, FeSA&#8722;N/TC achieves high peak power densities (H2&#8722;O2 PEMFC: 1100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2; H2&#8722;Air PEMFC: 715&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2; liquid&#8208;state ZAB: 228&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2; solid&#8208;state ZAB: 112&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), demonstrating its feasibility and efficiency in practical applications.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Tuning Metallic Sites in Molecular Complexes for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogenized molecular complexes were designed via coordinating Fe&#8722;Ni sites with four aromatic carboxylate ligands for electrocatalytic oxygen&#8208;evolving. In situ characteristics and theoretical analysis verify that the ligands&#8208;tuning strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction between molecular complexes and carbon support renders the charge accumulation on Fe&#8722;Ni sites through fast electron transfer, following by the reconstruction of active Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Ni centers.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic hybrid catalysts with highly tunable single&#8208;sites are promising for oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER), but molecular&#8208;scale understanding of underlying reaction mechanisms still remain elusive on these bulk materials. Herein, we report a direct construction of heterogenized molecular complexes stabilized on carbon substrates via coordinating Fe&#8722;Ni sites with four aromatic carboxylate ligands (FeNi&#8208;Lx). The ligands&#8208;tuning &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction between aromatic carboxylate ligands and carbon supports promote the oxidative charge accumulation on Fe&#8722;Ni sites via fast electron transferring, thus the optimized FeNi&#8208;Lx rendering a mass activity of 6680&#8197;A&#8201;gFe/Ni&#8722;1 at 0.3&#8197;V overpotential. In situ characteristics and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the OH&#8722; nucleophilic attack on hypervalent iron sites induce the reconstruction of active Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Ni species, accompanying with fast valence increasing. Whereas, during OER, the unexpected valence reduction of Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Ni sites would be attributed to the oxygen&#8208;generating from OOH* intermediates. These findings would establish an essential understanding of the origin of active centers in molecular complexes catalysts for oxygen&#8208;evolution.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the electronic and geometric structure of active sites helps heterogeneous catalysts to promote their performance. We found a polyoxometalates&#8208;mediated electronic interaction (PMEI) effect in CeO2 supported Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), which simultaneously reduced the electron density of Pt SAs and enhanced the acidity of catalysts. Such PMEI effect enables Pt&#8208;CeO2 SACs in selective catalysis with respect to environment protection.







Abstract
Optimizing the reactivity and selectivity of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) remains a crucial yet challenging issue in heterogeneous catalysis. This study demonstrates selective catalysis facilitated by a polyoxometalates&#8208;mediated electronic interaction (PMEI) in a Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst supported on CeO2 modified with Keggin&#8208;type phosphotungstate acid (HPW), labeled as Pt1/CeO2&#8208;HPW. The PMEI effect originates from the unique arrangement of isolated Pt atoms and HPW clusters on the CeO2 support. Electrons are transferred from the ceria support to the electrophilic tungsten in HPW clusters, and subsequently, Pt atoms donate electrons to the now electron&#8208;deficient ceria. This phenomenon enhances the positive charge of Pt atoms, moderating O2 activation and limiting lattice oxygen mobility compared to the conventional Pt1/CeO2 catalyst. The resulting electronic structure of Pt combined with the strong and local acidic environment of HPW on Pt1/CeO2&#8208;HPW leads to improved efficiency and N2 selectivity in the degradation of NH3 and NO, as well as increased CO2 yield when inputting volatile organic compounds. This study sheds the light on the design of SACs with balanced reactivity and selectivity for environmental catalysis.

         <title>Creating Spin Channels in SrCoO3 through Trigonal&#8208;to&#8208;Cubic Structural Transformation for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution/Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transformation of trigonal SrCoO2.5 into cubic SrCoO3 establishes spin&#8208;polarized electron channels, significantly enhancing oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER/ORR). The cubic phase's superior electron transport and ferromagnetic properties reduce overpotential at high current densities, offering key insights into the role of spin dynamics in catalytic processes.







Abstract
Oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) play crucial roles in energy conversion processes such as water splitting and air batteries, where spin dynamics inherently influence their efficiency. However, the specific contribution of spin has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we intentionally introduce a spin channel through the transformation of trigonal antiferromagnetic SrCoO2.5 into cubic ferromagnetic SrCoO3, aiming to deepen our understanding of spin dynamics in catalytic reactions. Based on the results from spherical&#8208;aberration&#8208;corrected microscopy, synchrotron absorption spectra, magnetic characterizations, and density functional theory calculations, it is revealed that surface electron transfer is predominantly governed by local geometric structures, while the presence of the spin channel significantly enhances the bulk transport of spin&#8208;polarized electrons, particularly under high current densities where surface electron transfer is no longer the limiting factor. The overpotential for OER is reduced by at least 70&#8197;mV at 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 due to the enhanced conductivity from spin&#8208;polarized electrons facilitated by spin channels, with an expectation of even more significant reductions at higher current densities. This work provides a clearer picture of the role of spin in oxygen&#8208;involved electrocatalysis, providing critical insights for the design of more efficient catalytic systems in practical applications.

         <title>Inside Cover: Proton Intercalation into an Open&#8208;Tunnel Bronze Phase with Near&#8208;Zero Volume Change (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 3/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton intercalation of Mo3Nb2O14 bronze occurs with near&#8208;zero volume change, which arises from rotation and shrinkage of the flexible MOn framework (M = Mo, Nb) as reported by Kosuke Kawai et al. in their Research Article (e202410971). As a result, the Mo3Nb2O14 particle maintains high crystallinity after repeating proton (de)intercalation, which contributes to high Coulombic efficiency and long&#8208;term charge/discharge operation of an aqueous proton battery.

Although gapped grain boundaries have often been observed in bulk and nanosized materials, they have not been reported in metal nanoparticles smaller than 2&#8197;nm owing to the difficulty in characterization and the high instability of grain boundary (GB) atoms. In their Research Article (e202410109), Zhikun Wu, Jun Yang, Lingwen Liao et al. report a novel nanocluster with a 26&#8208;atom gapped and rotated GB, and demonstrate the effectiveness of manipulating GBs for enhancing the catalytic activity of nanocatalysts.

Puzzling of ligands at C(0): In their Research Article (e202415228), Max M. Hansmann et&#8197;al. demonstrate a new strategy to afford stable diazoalkenes by cleavage of a carbophosphinocarbene and carbodicarbenes with N2O. The follow&#8208;up N2/NHC exchange allows easy access to novel carbodicarbenes or cumulenic compounds. The combination of exchange reactions overall allows to &#8220;puzzle&#8221; the fragments at a C(0) atom.

         <title>Crystalline Assemblies of DNA Nanostructures and Their Functional Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advancements in DNA tile and DNA origami&#8208;based 2D and 3D crystal lattice assemblies. It covers innovations in monomer design, guest molecule incorporation, and inorganic coating techniques. Key focus areas include assembly strategies, functional properties, structural challenges, and insights for future applications in programmable materials.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly presents a remarkable approach for creating intricate structures by positioning nanomaterials in precise locations, with control over molecular interactions. For example, material arrays with interplanar distances similar to the wavelength of light can generate structural color through complex interactions like scattering, diffraction, and interference. Moreover, enzymes, plasmonic nanoparticles, and luminescent materials organized in periodic lattices are envisioned to create functional materials with various applications. Focusing on structural DNA nanotechnology, here, we summarized the recent developments of two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional lattices made purely from DNA nanostructures. We review DNA&#8208;based monomer design for different lattices, guest molecule assembly, and inorganic material coating techniques and discuss their functional properties and potential applications in photonic crystals, nanoelectronics, and bioengineering as well as future challenges and perspectives.

         <title>Organic Circularly Polarized Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence: Strategies, Applications and Challenges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CPP) is essential in chemistry and materials&#8208;related fields. This Review summarizes the latest advances in organic CPP from the molecule to the supramolecular assembly scales, focusing on design strategies such as chirality transfer, assembly&#8208;induced chirality amplification, and chiral superstructure&#8208;mediated transmission. Remaining challenges and an insightful outlook are also presented.







Abstract
Organic circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) plays crucial roles in chemistry and biology for the potential in chiral recognition, asymmetric catalysis, 3D displays, and biological probes. The long&#8208;lived luminescence, large Stokes shift, and unique chiroptical properties make organic circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CPP) a new research hotspot in recent years. Nevertheless, achieving high&#8208;performance organic CPP is still challenging due to the sensitivity and complexity of integrating triplet excitons and polarization within organic materials. This review summarizes the latest advances in organic CPP, ranging from design strategies and photophysical properties to underlying luminescence mechanisms and potential applications. Specifically, the design strategies for generating CPP are systemically categorized and discussed according to the interactions between chiral units and chromophores. The applications of organic CPP in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, sensing, chiral recognition, afterglow displays, and information encryption are also illustrated. In addition, we present the current challenges and perspectives on developing organic CPP. We expect this review to provide some instructive design principles to fabricate high&#8208;performance organic CPP materials, offering an in&#8208;depth understanding of the luminescence mechanism and paving the way toward diverse practical applications.

         <title>Ether&#8208;Free Alkaline Polyelectrolytes for Water Electrolyzers: Recent Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) have attracted great interest for realizing sustainable society. AEMs as the core component of AEMWEs determine the longevity and efficiency of the system. Ether&#8208;free polyelectrolytes have shown great advantages in chemical stability. This review focuses on the preparation and modification strategies of ether&#8208;free polyelectrolytes and their degradation mechanism in AEMWE systems.







Abstract
Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) have attracted great interest for their potential as sustainable, environmentally friendly, low&#8208;cost sources of renewable energy. Alkaline polyelectrolytes play a crucial role in AEMWEs, determining their performance and longevity. Because heteroatom&#8208;containing polymers have been shown to have poor durability in alkaline conditions, this review focuses on ether&#8208;free alkaline polyelectrolytes, which are more chemically stable.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) have attracted great interest for their potential as sustainable, environmentally friendly, low-cost sources of renewable energy. Alkaline polyelectrolytes play a crucial role in AEMWEs, determining their performance and longevity. Because heteroatom-containing polymers have been shown to have poor durability in alkaline conditions, this review focuses on ether-free alkaline polyelectrolytes, which are more chemically stable. The merits, weaknesses, and challenges in preparing ether-free AEMs are summarized and highlighted. The evaluation of synthesis methods for polymers, modification strategies, and cationic stability will provide insights valuable for the structural design of future alkaline polyelectrolytes. Moreover, the in situ degradation mechanisms of AEMs and ionomers during AEMWE operation are revealed. This review provides insights into the design of alkaline polyelectrolytes for AEMWEs to accelerate their widespread commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Electron Oxidation Triggered by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Excited Enzymes for Asymmetric Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights an emerging strategy in photobiocatalysis: repurposing naturally occurring enzymes by visible&#8208;light excitation to trigger single&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidation&#8208;driven biotransformations. Combined with protein engineering, the highly oxidizing excited enzymatic flavin cofactor or enzyme&#8208;bound iminium ion enables various non&#8208;natural photobiocatalytic C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, and C&#8722;S bond&#8208;formation reactions in a stereocontrolled and redox&#8208;neutral manner.







Abstract
By integrating enzymatic catalysis with photocatalysis, photoenzymatic catalysis emerges as a powerful strategy to enhance enzyme catalytic capabilities and provide superior stereocontrol in reactions involving reactive intermediates. Repurposing naturally occurring enzymes using visible light is among the most active directions of photoenzymatic catalysis. This Minireview focuses on a cutting&#8208;edge strategy in this direction, namely single&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidation&#8208;triggered non&#8208;natural biotransformations catalyzed by photoexcited enzymes. These straightforward transformations feature a unique radical mechanism initiated by single&#8208;electron oxidation, achieving redox&#8208;neutral non&#8208;natural C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, and C&#8722;S bond formation, and expanding the chemical toolbox of enzymes. By highlighting recent advances in this field and emphasizing their catalytic mechanisms and synthetic potential, innovative approaches for photobiomanufacturing are anticipated.

         <title>Cleavage of the Robust Silicon&#8211;Fluorine &#963;&#8208;Bond Allows Silicon&#8211;Carbon Bond Formation: Synthetic Strategies Toward Ortho&#8208;Silyl Aryl Phosphonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, efficient, and metal&#8208;free Si&#8722;C and P&#8722;C bond formation was achieved by cleaving the robust Si&#8722;F &#963;&#8208;bond. Although activation of the Si&#8722;F bond is highly challenging, Si&#8722;F bond cleavage has been accomplished with the assistance of bidentate silicon and phosphonium Lewis acids. Various ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates were produced through this three&#8208;component coupling reaction involving arynes, phosphites, and silyl fluorides.







Abstract
A straightforward, mild, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free three&#8208;component coupling reaction involving arynes, phosphites, and silyl fluorides was developed through Si&#8722;F bond activation. Although the Si&#8722;F bond is one of the strongest bonds, Si&#8722;C bond formation via Si&#8722;F bond cleavage with the assistance of bidentate silicon and phosphonium Lewis acids has been successfully achieved. This unprecedented strategy provides a facile approach for synthesizing ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates. Notably, this method allows the use of not only dialkylarylsilyl fluorides and diarylalkylsilyl fluorides but also triarylsilyl fluorides as coupling partners, which is uncommon in the field of arylsilane synthesis. Furthermore, a variety of ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates were produced in moderate to good yields with broad functional group tolerance. Additionally, the versatility of ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates was demonstrated by the elaboration of the products into a range of silicon&#8208;containing compounds.

         <title>Formation of Multiple Naturally Occurring Meroterpenoid Scaffolds by the Norrish&#8208;Yang Reaction of a p&#8208;Benzoquinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis acid&#8208;promoted Norrish&#8208;Yang reaction of p&#8208;benzoquinone has been demonstrated. The chemodivergent features of this transformation arises from both the regiodivergence of the hydrogen abstraction and the spin properties of semiquinone radicals. The developed chemistry enabled the stereoselective synthesis of multiple scaffolds of Avarane&#8208;derived meroterpenoid from neoavarone.







Abstract
The Norrish&#8208;Yang reaction, as a typical example, demonstrates the inherent ability of photochemical reaction to facilitate formation of sterically congested C&#8722;C bonds, efficiently crafting intricate ring structure in complex organic molecules. Herein we report for the first time a unified synthesis using quinone&#8208;based acid&#8208;promoted Norrish&#8208;Yang photocyclization for the stereoselective construction of multiple avarane&#8208;type meroterpenoid natural products.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrophosphorylation of Unactivated Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrophosphorylation of alkynes is reported, marking the inaugural example of dynamic kinetic asymmetric hydrophosphorylation of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. The reaction exhibits a broad scope of unactivated alkynes, consistently yielding structurally diverse P&#8208;stereogenic phosphorus compounds with exclusive cis&#8208;selectivity and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;r.r. and 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee).







Abstract
P&#8208;stereogenic phosphorus compounds are essential across various fields, yet their synthesis via enantioselective P&#8722;C bond formation remains both challenging and underdeveloped. We report the first copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrophosphorylation of alkynes, facilitated by a newly designed chiral 1,2&#8208;diamine ligand. Unlike previous methods that rely on kinetic resolution with less than 50&#8201;% conversion, our approach employs a distinct dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation mechanism, achieving complete conversion of racemic starting materials. This reaction is compatible with a broad range of aromatic and aliphatic terminal alkynes, producing products with high yields (up to 95&#8201;%), exclusive cis selectivity, and exceptional regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;r.r. and up to 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee). The resulting products were further transformed into a diverse array of enantioenriched P&#8208;stereogenic scaffolds. Preliminary mechanistic studies were conducted to elucidate the reaction details.

A &#8220;band reformation of AGS&#8221; (AGS=AgGaS2) strategy leads to the discovery of four infrared nonlinear optical lanthanide sulfides, LiLnGeS4 (Ln=La&#8722;Nd). Particularly, LiLaGeS4 achieves a balance of wide band gap (3.32&#8197;eV), strong phase&#8208;matchable SHG response (1.06&#215;AGS), and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (&gt;14&#215;AGS), challenging for most lanthanide sulfides.







Abstract
AgGaS2 (AGS) is the most commonly used commercial infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) material. However, AGS has a narrow band gap (Eg=2.58&#8197;eV) and a low laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LIDT), primarily attributed to its mobile liquid&#8208;like Ag+ constituent and the unstable Ag&#8722;S chemical bond. Herein, we propose a &#8220;band reformation of AGS&#8221; strategy, which leads to the successful syntheses of four lanthanide sulfides, LiLnGeS4 (Ln=La&#8722;Nd), crystalizing in an asymmetric Ama2 structure. LiLaGeS4 demonstrates that eliminating the presence of Ag&#8208;4d band increases the Eg to 3.32&#8197;eV and enhances the LIDT (14&#8211;29&#215;AGS, measured by both powder and single crystal); while increasing the nonbonding density of states of the S&#8208;3p band enhances the 2nd&#8208;nonlinear optical coefficient (1.06&#215;AGS). Besides, the bond length discrepancy between [LiS4], [GeS4] and [LaS8] units leads to a moderate birefringence (&#916;n=0.052). Such a unique structure further results in extremely small thermal expansion with &#945;L=0.41&#8211;1.74&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, along different crystallographic axes. Our theoretical studies indicate that the synergy of the structure building units contribute to the second harmonic generation performance. These results suggest that the &#8220;band reformation of AGS&#8221; strategy provides effective guidance to discover new NLO crystals with optimized performance.

         <title>A Noncovalent &#960;&#8208;Stacked Dual&#8208;Pore Molecular Crystal for Ethanol/Water and Benzene/Methanol Azeotrope Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust &#960;&#8208;stacked dual&#8208;pore molecular crystal TDTBA&#8208;1 has been constructed by a single organic molecule with highly Td symmetry. Due to strong &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between conjugated aromatic moieties, activated TDTBA&#8208;1 exhibits exceptional hydrophobicity, thermostability and chemical resistance, making it an outstanding stationary phase for achieving high&#8208;efficiency separation of ethanol/water and benzene/methanol azeotropes.







Abstract
Separation of ethanol/water or benzene/methanol azeotrope mixtures presents significant challenges, not only due to the limitations of conventional distillation techniques but also because of the constraints in developing and utilizing of new generation adsorbents. Porous organic molecular frameworks constructed via noncovalent &#960;&#8208;interactions are emerging as novel adsorbents with vast potential in gas adsorption and molecular separation. Herein, we report a permanent two&#8208;dimensional porous structure, namely TDTBA&#8208;1, which consists of two different kinds of pores through &#960;&#8208;stacking of a single organic molecule with highly Td symmetry. Activated TDTBA&#8208;1 exhibits excellent hydrophobicity, thermal stability, recoverability and high selectivity for ethanol over water, and benzene over methanol. Therefore, activated TDTBA&#8208;1 can be used as an efficient stationary phase for the separation of ethanol/water and benzene/methanol azeotropes by high&#8208;resolution gas chromatography.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;active Cyclometalated Platinum Ring Enables Synthetic Post&#8208;processing of a [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new platinum&#8208;containing rotaxane was developed and underwent post&#8208;synthetic modification via modulation of the redox properties of the metal center. Oxidation using mild reagents led to rapid conversion to a PtIV complex and a PtIII dimer with different photophysical and shuttling dynamics. Notably, this is the first known example where a Pt&#8722;Pt bond has been used as a bridge to access higher&#8208;order rotaxanes.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic modification of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) is an attractive avenue to add complexity to already intricate systems. This remains an important, challenging topic that is under&#8208;developed. In this paper, we report the synthesis and characterization of a [2]rotaxane molecule featuring a ring appended to an emissive cyclometalated PtII unit. Modulation of the oxidation state at the metal center can transform the interlocked molecule into a new PtIV [2]rotaxane or a PtIII [3]rotaxane held together by an intermetallic Pt&#8722;Pt bond &#8211; a first of its kind. These molecules display distinct structural and photophysical properties, as well as shuttling dynamics. This approach for post&#8208;synthetic modification could be used to construct more complex MIMs and inorganic supramolecular assemblies with redox properties.

An &#945;&#8208;nucleophilic addition reaction to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds was developed via &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbocations that are generated in situ through the photocatalytic oxidation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals by the organic super&#8208;photoreductant CBZ6.

Abstract
We report the photocatalytic oxidation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals of amides or esters to the corresponding &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbocations through super photoreductant CBZ6 induced redox&#8208;neutral photocatalysis.

This method enables the &#945;&#8208;nucleophilic addition of hydroxyl or alkoxyl radicals to amides and esters without any prefunctionalization.

         <title>Photochemically Triggered and Autonomous Oscillatory pH&#8208;Modulated Transient Assembly/Disassembly of DNA Microdroplet Coacervates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable or oscillatory pH changes induced by a photoacid or Landolt oscillatory reaction are applied to induce the transient assembly/disassembly of microdroplet protocells. Cyclic and autonomous formation/depletion of the microdroplets following the rhythm of pH changes are demonstrated.







Abstract

         <title>Unravelling the Effect of Crystal Facet of Derived&#8208;Copper Catalysts on the Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide under Unified Mass Transport Condition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of five catalysts with the same roughness coefficient, Cu2O(d)700, CuO(d)700, CuCl(d)700, Cu(NP1)700 and Cu(NP2)700, was prepared to investigate the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. The microcosmic environment of the catalysts was unified by controlling the roughness coefficient, which in turn ensured that the relationship between the crystal facet and the selectivity of C2+ was investigated under the same mass transfer conditions. A positive correlation between the percentage of Cu(100) and the selectivity of C2+ is revealed.







Abstract
Altering the physical structure and chemical property of copper, i.e., particle size, surface morphology, composition or crystal facet, has been demonstrated to be effective in steering the selectivity of products in electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. However, these modifications generally result in the change of active surface area, leading to differences in geometric current density and local pH, which are also demonstrated to be the key factors for observed selectivity change. In this work, we deconvolute the effect of mass transport and local pH from the effect of crystal facet by investigating five copper&#8208;based catalysts with identical roughness factor for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in an H&#8208;cell. Interestingly, CuO&#8208;derived catalyst stands out as the best catalyst for C&#8722;C coupling. At &#8722;1.07&#8197;V vs. RHE, the faradaic efficiency of C2+ product reaches 44.3&#8201;%, with a partial current density of &#8722;21.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Electrochemical adsorption of *OH reveals that the C2+ product selectivity of derived&#8208;copper catalysts correlates positively with the ratio of Cu(100)/Cu(110) of five catalysts. Additionally, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the percentage of low&#8208;frequency&#8208;band linear CO (LFB&#8208;CO), which is attributed to the adsorbed *CO on Cu(100) facet, increases with the C&#8722;C coupling efficiency.

         <title>A Urease&#8208;Based pH Photoswitch: A General Route to Light&#8208;to&#8208;pH Transduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general module for light&#8208;to&#8208;pH transduction in enzymatic reaction networks is presented. Using an azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable inhibitor for urease, it becomes possible to time&#8208;program a pH transition from 4.7 to 8.3 by light. The autocatalytic positive feedback loop resulting from the pH dependence of urease activity enhances the effective switching factor of the inhibitor. The pH change leads to a change in the activity of other enzymes downstream. These findings show a new and general route to functional light&#8208;responsive ERNs.







Abstract
New approaches for the integration of chemical and physical stimuli to control the dynamics of artificial enzymatic reaction networks (ERNs) are needed. Here, we present a general approach to convert a light stimulus into a time&#8208;programmed pH response. We developed and characterized a panel of photoswitchable inhibitors of urease. Urease activity, now regulated by light via the photoinhibitors, leads to an increase in pH upon hydrolysis of urea into ammonia. Careful choice of characteristics of light, and concentrations of enzyme, substrate, and photoinhibitor, allowed us to control the timing of the pH transition. Furthermore, as all enzymes have an activity&#8211;pH profile, the urease photoinhibitor system can be used to regulate the activities of other enzymes in small reaction networks.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective hydrophosphination of 2H&#8208;azirines is reported based on a newly discovered Mn(I) catalyst that plays an important role in both the reactivity and stereoselectivity of the process. Various valuable aziridine phosphines can now be accessed in high yields and enantiopurities. DFT calculations provide mechanistic insights.







Abstract
Herein, we present the first catalytic asymmetric nucleophilic addition of diarylphosphines to 2H&#8208;azirines, facilitated by a chiral Mn(I) complex. This method not only provides access to novel class of derivatives of the aziridine core &#8211; a structural motif recognized for its antitumor and antibacterial properties &#8211; but also introduces a phosphine moiety alongside the generation of an NH moiety within a strained three&#8208;membered ring. The discovery of this new Mn(I) complex that both enables the reaction and induces stereoselectivity is pivotal, as it underscores the significant potential of this earth&#8208;abundant metal in advancing asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Reduction Polymerization of CO2 with Phenylene Silanes Catalyzed by Single Component B(C6F5)3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single component B(C6F5)3 can catalyze the step&#8208;growth reduction polymerization of CO2 with phenylene silanes bearing functional groups, and also the tandem Piers&#8208;Rubinsztajn polymerization followed by CO2 hydrosilylation polymerization, generating poly(siloxane)s that are impossible to access using the current synthons. The mechanism investigation shows that HB(C6F5)2 derived from B(C6F5)3 plays the crucial role to fix and reduce CO2 to silylformate. The subsequent multiple reductions of silylformate to give polymer and CH4 can be fulfilled by both HB(C6F5)2 and B(C6F5)3.







Abstract
CO2 is an abundant C1 resource but a green&#8208;house gas and chemically inert. Thus, its utilization has been a promising but challenging project. Herein, we report the unprecedented polymerization of CO2 and C6H4(SiMe2H)2 using B(C6F5)3 alone under mild conditions to give poly(silphenylene siloxane) accompanied by releasing CH4. The copolymerization can be extended to comonomers of phenylene silanes bearing functional groups. Moreover, it combines with Piers&#8208;Rubinsztajn reaction to establish a tandem polymerization system to achieve super thermal resistant poly(siloxane&#8208;co&#8208;silphenylene siloxane)s. Density functional theory reveals that B(C6F5)3 is activated by silanes to form free HB(C6F5)2, which is the true active species for CO2 reducing to borylformate, the rate controlling step of the polymerization procedure. The subsequent multiple reductions of borylformate to CH4 and the step&#8208;growth to poly(silphenylene siloxane)s can be fulfilled by both B(C6F5)3 and HB(C6F5)2, and the former shows a slightly higher activity. This work opens a new avenue of utilizing CO2 to fabricate polysiloxanes that is unable to access using current manners.

Density functional theory reveals that B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is activated by silanes to form free HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the true active species for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reducing to borylformate, the rate controlling step of the polymerization procedure. The subsequent multiple reductions of borylformate to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and the step-growth to poly(silphenylene siloxane)s can be fulfilled by both B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the former shows a slightly higher activity. This work opens a new avenue of utilizing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to fabricate polysiloxanes that is unable to access using current manners.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanding the Landscape of Phosphorous&#8208;Based Open Shell Species: Stable Mono&#8208;, Di&#8208;, and Trianionic Radicals Based on a Contorted Triphosphaalkene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sequential single&#8208;electron reduction of a truxene&#8208;based triphosphaalkene afforded mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and triradical anionic species. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a highly contorted truxene core in the solid&#8208;state structures of mono&#8208; and dianions. The significant structural contortion is further associated with the emergence of open&#8208;shell electronic configurations in the di&#8208; and trianionic species.







Abstract
The stepwise reduction of the highly contorted truxene&#8208;based triphosphaalkene 1 using KC8 led to the isolation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;anionic species. The solid&#8208;state molecular structures of mono&#8208; and diradical anionic species were elucidated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions, revealing elongated P&#8722;C bonds and a pronounced &#8220;indene&#8221; aromatization compared to the parent system. All three radical species displayed distinct Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra, providing compelling evidence for the open&#8208;shell electronic configuration of both the diradical and triradical species&#8212;an observation unprecedented in any previously reported phosphorous&#8208;based anionic polyradicals. Mulliken spin density calculations revealed a dominant localization of radical spin on a single phosphorous atom in the monoanion. In the dianion, spin localization is observed on two phosphorous atoms (~34&#8201;% each), with a minor contribution from the third phosphorous (0.13&#8201;%), while the trianion demonstrates a uniform distribution of spin density (~30&#8201;%) across each phosphorous atom.

         <title>Assembly Regulates Gamma Radiation Polymerization of Polytelluoxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kinetic&#8208;based strategy for regulating responsiveness of gamma radiation&#8208;induced chemical reaction was developed. The strategy was realized in the polymerization of polytelluoxane (PTeO) through the construction of different assembly microenvironment. The assembly also kept changing with radiation and make it a milder method to prepare such polymer.







Abstract
Regulating chemical drug's responsiveness to gamma radiation is crucial for achieving better therapeutic effects in cancer treatment. Most research focused on thermodynamic chemical structure design, while little attention was paid to kinetic regulate strategy, which possesses greater universality and security. In this study, we achieved a kinetic&#8208;based regulate strategy of gamma radiation reaction, through the construction of microphase environment during polymerization of polytelluoxane (PTeO). We designed hydrophobic segments forming large compound micelles (LCMs) assembly to create kinetically favorable higher concentration for radiation&#8208;induced reaction. It exhibited a &gt; ten times higher responsiveness and, as far as we know, merely required a minimum dosage of 5 Gy for polymerization to occur. What's more, by taking advantages of the assembly change with Te&#8722;O hydrophilic segments and gamma radiation, polymerization became milder with lower polydispersity than previous methods. Such kinetic&#8208;based regulate strategy could offer a novel perspective on the design of radiation&#8208;responsive chemoradiotherapy and other radiation&#8208;induced chemical process.

         <title>Construction of Liposome&#8208;Based Extracellular Artificial Organelles on Individual Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Individual cells are coated with multilayered functional liposomes, serving as extracellular artificial organelles, or exorganelles, and conferring extrinsic capacity on the cells. The method is highly cytocompatible, interfacing with living cells, and chemically flexible in the lipid composition and cargo of the exorganelles. Cells are empowered with various functions, beyond their innate ones, such as multienzymatic catalysis, magnetizability, stimuli&#8208;responsive chemical release, and cell modification.







Abstract
Integration of living cells with extrinsic functional entities gives rise to bioaugmented nanobiohybrids, which hold tremendous potential across diverse fields such as cell therapy, biocatalysis, and cell robotics. This study presents a biocompatible method for incorporating multilayered functional liposomes onto the cell surface, creating extracellular artificial organelles or exorganelles. The introduction of various extrinsic functionalities to cells is achieved without comprising their viabilities. The integration of extrinsic enzymatic reactions is exemplified through the cascade reaction involving glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase. Furthermore, our protocol offers the design flexibility to customize liposome compositions, thereby providing effective cell modification. The versatility of the liposome&#8208;based exorganelle approach establishes an advanced chemical tool, empowering cells with novel functionalities that surpass or are complementary to their innate capabilities.

         <title>Catalytic Dearomative [1,5]&#8208;Sigmatropic Carbon Shift of Heterole&#8208;Fused Norcaradienes Enabled Concise Helicenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile helicenation of two (hetero) arenes linked by an alkynylcyclopropane: Weakly aromatic heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes from hydroarylation of heterole&#8208;substituted alkynylcyclopropanes reserve a balancing fluxionality that permits a dearomative and controllable [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic carbon shift. A following ester&#8208;directed ring&#8208;opening aromatization of the dearomatized heterole&#8208;fused norcaradiene gives the acylmethyl&#8208;shifted aromatization products, which are readily helicenated with the neighboring (hetero) arenes.







Abstract
In contrast to the locked fluxionality of norcaradienes fused by benzene, unexplored less aromatic heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes, creatively generated by intramolecular hydroarylation of heteroaryl alkynylcyclopropanes, reserve a balancing fluxionality that permits a dearomative [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic carbon shift of norcaradienes akin to the reduced aromaticity of heterole. This &#8220;walk&#8221; shift was confirmed by the isolation of a cycloheptatriene species derived from ring&#8208;expansion of a dearomatized alkynylated heterole&#8208;fused norcaradiene. A following ester&#8208;directed ring&#8208;opening rearomatization of these dearomatized heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes gives the products featuring migratory acylmethyls that are competent for helicenation with the neighboring (hetero) arenes via (formal) dehydrative alkenylation. Such balancing reactivity of heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes will open up the opportunity for the development of controllable reactions of fused norcaradienes.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Diborylation and Silaboration of Azoarenes: A Simple Photoinduced Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have shown that, in the absence of a catalyst or a base, azoarenes&#8242; photoswitchability can be exploited to aid in their diborylation into 1,2&#8208;bis(boryl)hydrazines. The transformation is achieved using commercially available diboron reagent, bis(catecholato)diboron and extremely mild conditions are used in the devised approach. Moreover, silaboranes were also activated using this process to yield 1&#8208;silyl&#8208;2&#8208;borylhydrazines.







Abstract
The diborylation of the N=N double bond of azoarenes has been achieved using a commercially available diboron reagent, B2cat2 [bis(catecholato)diboron]. By utilizing the photo&#8208;switchable nature of azoarenes under blue&#8208;LED light irradiation, an uncatalyzed diborylation and silaboration yielded a broad range of functionalized hydrazine derivatives. The mechanistic origin validates the importance of cis configuration, which is corroborated by theoretical calculations.

     alt="Catalyst-Free Diborylation and Silaboration of Azoarenes: A Simple Photoinduced Approach"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have shown that, in the absence of a catalyst or a base, azoarenes&#8242; photoswitchability can be exploited to aid in their diborylation into 1,2-bis(boryl)hydrazines. The transformation is achieved using commercially available diboron reagent, bis(catecholato)diboron and extremely mild conditions are used in the devised approach. Moreover, silaboranes were also activated using this process to yield 1-silyl-2-borylhydrazines.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [2+2] Annulation for the Construction of Chiral Benzocyclobutenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective [2+2] annulation for the construction of chiral benzocyclobutenes was developed for the first time. A wide range of enantio&#8208;enriched BCBs could be prepared selectively under mild conditions. Further transformations of the products provide efficient access to a diverse array of chiral BCBs. The enantiodetermining step has been investigated via isolation of the chiral palladacycle intermediate and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Asymmetric de novo synthesis of benzocyclobutenes (BCBs) via catalytic intermolecular reaction is highly desired for efficient access to this important class of compounds, yet such a strategy remains unmet challenge. Here, we report a Pd/Pyrox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [2+2] annulation between arylboronic acids and functionalized alkenes, providing an unprecedented efficient protocol to access various enantio&#8208;enriched BCBs in a modular and versatile manner under mild conditions. A broad substrate scope with excellent enantioselectivity has been achieved under the current protocol. The isolation and characterization of the key chiral palladacycle intermediate, together with DFT calculations, provides strong evidence for the catalytic pathway including an enantiodetermining arylpalladation step.

         <title>Hollow Hydrogels for Excellent Aerial Water Collection and Autonomous Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conical hollow hydrogel architecture is reported, which can rapidly collect water from humid air to a saturation point, whereupon it automatically and continually releases fresh water without any external assistance, demonstrating high potential for emergency water collection in arid areas. The hydrogel is biodegradable, and can eventually decompose, and become an organic fertilizer after the water supply is not required.







Abstract
Air moisture is a valuable and omnipresent resource of fresh water. However, traditional water collectors come with an enduring problem of the water&#8208;release step, which requires special devices and additional energy to remove the water from the adsorbent, such as heat, sunlight, or both. Herein, we report the first composite conical hollow hydrogel architecture fabricated through a film&#8208;to&#8208;tube transforming protocol, designed to harvest water from aerial humidity. This hollow hydrogel device can rapidly collect water from humid air to a saturation point, whereupon it automatically and continually releases fresh water at room temperature. The entire water collection and release process does not require any external assistance. Therefore, this device is highly suitable for emergency water collection in arid areas. As an exemplary demonstration, positioning the hollow hydrogel device next to a plant turns into an individualized system for irrigation. Since the device is biodegradable, it eventually decomposes and becomes an organic fertilizer after the water supply is not required. For long&#8208;term application, the water&#8208;release process can be monitored in real time by an electronic device to indicate the amount of collected water. The hollow hydrogel combines the humidity&#8208;adsorbing capacity with autonomous water release that carries the potential for harvesting water from humidity to address the shortage of fresh water, especially in arid locations where other sources of water are scarce or inaccessible.

         <title>Nuclear Quantum Effects Have a Significant Impact on UV/Vis Absorption Spectra of Chromophores in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structures of the isolated indole molecule as well as indole dissolved in water were sampled with and without consideration of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). For each sampled structure, electronic excitation energies were calculated using a wavefunction&#8208;based method called ADC(2) for generating UV/Vis absorption spectra. Shapes and solvatochromism observed in the measured spectra were reproduced only when NQEs were considered in the sampling.







Abstract
Despite the broadly acknowledged importance of solvation effects on measured UV/Vis spectra in the context of solvatochromism or chemical reactions in solution, it is still an open challenge to calculate UV/Vis spectra with predictive accuracy. This is particularly true when it comes to the impact of nuclear quantum effects on these experimental observables. In the present work, we calculate the UV/Vis absorption spectrum of indole in aqueous solution with a combination of a correlated wavefunction method for computing electronic excitation energies and enhanced path integral simulations for rigorous sampling of nuclear configurations including the quantum effects in solution. After validating our approach based on gas&#8208;phase benchmarking, we demonstrate that the lineshape of the spectrum measured in aqueous solution is quantitatively recovered, without the application of any shifting, scaling, or broadening, only after including nuclear quantum effects in addition to thermal fluctuations and solvation at ambient conditions. Our findings demonstrate that nuclear quantum effects are &#8220;visible&#8221; in UV/Vis spectra of chromophores measured in solution even at room temperature and, therefore, that they must be considered computationally to achieve predictive accuracy.

         <title>Enabling Visible Light Sensitization of YbIII, NdIII and ErIII in Dimeric LnIII/GaIII Metallacrowns through Functionalization with RuII Complexes for NIR&#8208;II Multiplex Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
LnRu&#8208;3 dimeric LnIII/GaIII metallacrows bearing four RuII chromophoric complexes have been synthesized and proved to exhibit characteristic emissions of YbIII, NdIII and ErIII in the NIR&#8208;II region upon excitation with visible light through metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) states. The unambiguous detection of different LnIII transitions has been demonstrated by NIR&#8208;II luminescence imaging of capillaries containing solutions of LnRu&#8208;3.







Abstract
Multiplex imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) provides exciting opportunities for more precise understanding of biological processes and more accurate diagnosis of diseases by enabling real&#8208;time acquisition of images with improved contrast and spatial resolution in deeper tissues. Today, the number of imaging agents suitable for this modality remains very scarce. In this work, we have synthesized and fully characterized, including theoretical calculations, a series of dimeric LnIII/GaIII metallacrowns bearing RuII polypyridyl complexes, LnRu&#8208;3 (Ln=YIII, YbIII, NdIII, ErIII). Relaxed structures of YRu&#8208;3 in the ground and the excited electronic states have been calculated using dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory methods. Detailed photophysical studies of LnRu&#8208;3 have demonstrated that characteristic emission signals of YbIII, NdIII and ErIII in the NIR&#8208;II range can be sensitized upon excitation in the visible range through RuII&#8208;centered metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) states. We have also showed that these NIR&#8208;II signals are unambiguously detected in an imaging experiment using capillaries and biological tissue&#8208;mimicking phantoms. This work opens unprecedented perspectives for NIR&#8208;II multiplex imaging using LnIII&#8208;based molecular compounds.

         <title>Cleavage of Carbodicarbenes with N2O for Accessing Stable Diazoalkenes: Two&#8208;Fold Ligand Exchange at a C(0)&#8208;Atom</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbodicarbenes activate N2O in a NHC/N2 ligand exchange reaction to give stable diazoalkenes and a urea byproduct. By applying the NHC/N2 exchange, new classes of benzimidazole&#8208; and benzothiazole&#8208;diazoalkenes are reported. Combining two&#8208;fold ligand exchange reactions at C(0) a versatile route to carbodicarbenes and cumulenes is opened up.







Abstract
The cleavage of carbophosphinocarbenes and carbodicarbenes with nitrous oxide (N2O) leads to the formation of room&#8208;temperature stable diazoalkenes. The utility of Ph3P/N2 and NHC/N2 ligand exchange reactions were demonstrated by accessing novel benzimidazole&#8208; and benzothiazole derived diazoalkenes, which are not accessible by the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. The stable diazoalkenes subsequently allow further ligand exchange reactions at C(0) with carbon monoxide, isocyanide, or a diamidocarbene (DAC). Overall, the combination of hitherto unknown NHC/N2 and N2/L (L = DAC, CO, R&#8722;NC) ligand exchange reactions at a C(0) center allow the selective functionalization of the carbodicarbene ligand structure which represents a new methodology to rapidly assemble novel carbodicarbenes or cumulenic compounds.

         <title>Dynamic Organic Phosphorescence Glass by Rigid&#8208;Soft Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rigid&#8208;soft coupling strategy is adopted to prepare organic phosphorescence glass with excellent shaping ability. The glasses exhibit stable RTP and fascinating HTP emission in harsh conditions, and the phosphorescence behavior can be dynamically manipulated by photoactivation. Direct patterning is further achieved using photolithography to offer various afterglow patterns, which can be easily erased and rewritten with good reversibility.







Abstract
Organic phosphorescence glass has garnered considerable attention owing to the excellent shaping ability and photophysical behavior, but facile construction from single&#8208;component phosphors is still challenging. Herein, a rigid&#8208;soft coupling design is adopted in organic phosphors of ICO, CCO and PCO, thus preparing phosphorescence glasses through melting&#8208;quenching method to give excellent shaping ability and dynamic phosphorescence. RTP performance is significantly enhanced in the dense&#8208;structure glass, and intriguing high&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (HTP) is still observable even at 400&#8197;K. Direct patterning under UV irradiation is also achieved using photolithography technique, allowing for the creation of high&#8208;quality afterglow patterns that can be reversibly erased and rewritten. This rigid&#8208;soft conformation in organic phosphors elucidates a promising concept for achieving efficient RTP glass with wide application prospects.

         <title>&#8220;Boron Ylide&#8221; Enables Stereoselective Construction of gem&#8208;Diborylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The umpolung of diborodibromomethane (DBDBM) offers a convenient approach to generate &#945;&#8208;bromo &#8220;boron ylide&#8221;. The &#8220;boron ylide&#8221; serves as C1 synthon for cyclopropanation reaction, facilitating the synthesis of gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes. Asymmetric cyclopropanation was achieved with the aid of chiral auxiliary. Control experiments exhibit that the boryl groups are essential for the smooth progress of the reaction and the control of stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The stereoselective cyclopropanation of olefins with &#8220;boron ylide&#8221; is disclosed for the first time, providing a modular strategy for the synthesis of stereospecific diboryl&#8208;functionalized cyclopropanes. The chiral gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes are synthesized with excellent enantioselectivity with the aid of a chiral auxiliary. Based on the powerful transformable ability of boryl group, those challenging multi&#8208;quaternary carbon centers in cyclopropane units have been facilely constructed with excellent stereoselectivity. Control experiments indicate that the boryl groups are necessary for both chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity control.

         <title>Clar's Aromatic &#960;&#8208;Sextet Rule for the Construction of Red Multiple Resonance Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on Clar's aromatic &#960;&#8208;sextet rule, we have successfully constructed the first red &#960;&#8208;extended multiple resonance (MR) emitter by substituting the conventional benzene ring core with anthracene. The corresponding narrowband red (luminescence wavelength: 608&#8197;nm) organic light&#8208;emitting diode exhibits a high external quantum efficiency of 27.3&#8201;%, with only a slight decrease of 3.7&#8201;% at an elevated luminance level of 100,000 cd/m2.







Abstract
Despite the proliferation of multiple resonance (MR) materials in the blue to green spectral ranges, red MR emitters remain scarce in the literature, an area that certainly warrants attention for future applications. Here, through a clever application of classic Clar's aromatic &#960;&#8208;sextet rule, we triumphantly constructed the first red MR emitter by substituting the conventional benzene ring core with anthracene (fewer &#960;&#8208;sextets). Theoretical studies indicate that the quantity of &#960;&#8208;sextets ultimately determines the optical band gap of a molecule, rather than the number of fused benzene rings. Benefiting from the high photoluminescence quantum yield of ~94&#8201;% and horizontal dipole ratio of ~90&#8201;%, the corresponding narrowband red (luminescence wavelength: 608&#8197;nm) organic light&#8208;emitting diode shows a high external quantum efficiency of 27.3&#8201;%, with only a slight decrease of 3.7&#8201;% at an elevated luminance level of 100,000&#8197;cd/m2.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Construction of N&#8208;Linked Glycopeptides through Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;type glycopeptides have been successfully synthesized for the first time via photocatalytic free radical reactions. This novel approach involves the addition of acyl radicals to unprotected peptides and is expected to have broad applications in modifying a range of important natural products and peptides.







Abstract
The glycosylation of peptides and proteins can significantly impact their intrinsic properties, such as conformation, stability, antigenicity, and immunogenicity. Current methods for preparing N&#8208;linked glycopeptides typically rely on amide bond formation, which can be limited by the presence of reactive functional groups like acids and amines. Late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides offers a promising approach to obtaining N&#8208;linked glycopeptides. In this study, we demonstrate the preparation of N&#8208;linked glycopeptides through a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective Giese addition between N&#8208;glycosyl oxamic acid and peptides containing dehydroalanine (Dha) under visible light conditions. Unlike traditional methods that rely on the coupling of aspartic acid and glycosylamine, this approach utilizes the conjugation of N&#8208;glycosylated carbamoyl radicals with Dha, facilitating the straightforward modification of complex peptides.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stage Optimization of Pore Size and Shape in Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Highly Selective and Sensitive Benzene Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new pore&#8208;space&#8208;partitioned materials based on cobalt&#8208;vanadium trimers have been synthesized in which benzene/cyclohexane selectivity is tuned from 4.5 to 15.6 to 195.4 and to 482.5 by pushing the boundary of the pacs platform towards the smallest modules achievable so far.







Abstract
Compared to exploratory development of new structure types, pushing the limits of isoreticular synthesis on a high&#8208;performance MOF platform may have higher probability of achieving targeted properties. Multi&#8208;modular MOF platforms could offer even more opportunities by expanding the scope of isoreticular chemistry. However, navigating isoreticular chemistry towards best properties on a multi&#8208;modular platform is challenging due to multiple interconnected pathways. Here on the multi&#8208;modular pacs (partitioned acs) platform, we demonstrate accessibility to a new regime of pore geometry using two independently adjustable modules (framework&#8208;forming module 1 and pore&#8208;partitioning module 2). A series of new pacs materials have been made. Benzene/cyclohexane selectivity is tuned, progressively, from 4.5 to 15.6 to 195.4 and to 482.5 by pushing the boundary of the pacs platform towards the smallest modules known so far. The exceptional stability of these materials in retaining both porosity and single crystallinity enables single&#8208;crystal diffraction studies of different crystal forms (as&#8208;synthesized, activated, guest&#8208;loaded) that help reveal the mechanistic aspects of adsorption in pacs materials.

         <title>Novel Amorphous Nitride&#8208;Halide Solid Electrolytes with Enhanced Performance for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a new class of amorphous nitride&#8208;halide solid electrolytes, Li3xMClyNx (referred to as LMCN, M=Ta or La, 1&#8804;3x&#8804;1.4, y=5 or 3), which can be rendered amorphous through nitrogen incorporation. The introduction of N3&#8722; into LMCN alters the coordination between cations and anions, leading to the formation of amorphous structure and enhancing Li+ transport by stretching of M&#8722;Cl bonds. Li3xTaCl5Nx (referred to as LTCN) achieves ionic conductivities as high as 7.34&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 3x=1.25 and 30&#8201;&#176;C. These properties enable the corresponding all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries to perform well at high rates and charging cut&#8208;off voltage, and to maintain stable cycling at temperatures as low as &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. LMCN shows great promise as a novel solid electrolyte, expected to guide future research and serve as a representative model for the development of other nitrogen&#8208;halide solid electrolytes.







Abstract
Solid electrolytes (SEs) in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) are garnering considerable attention for their potential applications in next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. Amorphous SEs with dual&#8208;anion hold great promise for achieving favorable performance, such as high ionic conductivity and good compatibility with electrodes within ASSBs. Here, we discover a family of amorphous nitride&#8208;halide SEs, Li3xMClyNx (M=Ta or La, 1&#8804;3x&#8804;1.4, y=5 or 3), which can achieve ionic conductivities up to 7.34&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. The amorphous properties and local structures are investigated using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, and atomic pair distribution function analysis. Impressively, ASSBs employing amorphous Li3xTaCl5Nx have demonstrated good performance at high rates and charging voltages, as well as at low temperature.

         <title>A High&#8208;Entropy Engineering on Sustainable Anionic Redox Mn&#8208;Based Cathode with Retardant Stress for High&#8208;Rate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found the high&#8208;entropy construction in the Mn&#8208;based layered oxide could provide high reversible capacity, cycle life and fast Na+ kinetic behaviors through the strong and sustainable oxygen anion redox. And the lattice framework could be greatly strengthened and the stress concentration could also be alleviated. The demonstration of this concept shed lights onto the development of long&#8208;lasting and high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based (Mn&#8208;based) layered oxides have emerged as competitive cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), primarily due to their high energy density, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and potential for mass production. However, these materials often suffer from irreversible oxygen redox reactions, significant phase transitions, and microcrack formation, which lead to considerable internal stress and degradation of electrochemical performance. This study introduces a high&#8208;entropy engineering strategy for P2&#8208;type Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathodes (HE&#8208;NMCO), wherein a multi&#8208;ingredient cocktail effect strengthens the lattice framework by modulating the local environmental chemistry. This innovative approach fosters sustainable reversible oxygen activity, mitigates stress concentrations at grain boundaries, and accelerates Na+ transport kinetics. The resulting robust lattice framework with optimized elemental interactions significantly improves structural integrity and reduces the formation of intragranular fractures. Consequently, HE&#8208;NMCO demonstrates remarkable cycling stability, retaining 93.5&#8201;% capacity after 100 deep (de)sodiation cycles, alongside an enhanced rate capability of 134.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C. Notably, comparative studies through multimodal characterization techniques highlight HE&#8208;NMCO&#8242;s superior reversibility in oxygen anion redox (OAR) reactions over extensive cycling, contrasting sharply with conventional NMCO cathode. This work elucidates the potential for advancing high energy and power density Mn&#8208;based cathodes for SIBs through local species diversity.

This work elucidates the potential for advancing high energy and power density Mn-based cathodes for SIBs through local species diversity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CsPbBr3 Superstructures with Circularly Polarized Photolumines&#8208;Cence Obtained by the Self&#8208;Assembly and Annealing of Nanoclusters</title>

We report a two&#8208;step approach to fabricate CsPbBr3 superstructures with circularly polarized photoluminescence by self&#8208;assembly of nanoclusters, followed by annealing.







Abstract
We report a two&#8208;step approach to fabricate CsPbBr3 superstructures with strongly circularly polarized photoluminescence by self&#8208;assembly of nanoclusters on a substrate, followed by their annealing. In the first step, the nanoclusters self&#8208;assemble upon solvent evaporation, a process that forms mesoscopic superstructures whose geometrical arrangement at the &#956;m&#8208;scale confers them optical chirality. In the second step, mild annealing of such superstructures induces the coalescence of the nanoclusters, accompanied by a continuous red shift of the photoluminescence up to 530&#8197;nm, with preservation of the &#956;m&#8208;scale wires bundles and the chiral properties of the sample (glum=0.1). The successful chirality transfer from the initial nanoclusters assemblies to these final CsPbBr3 superstructures provides a convenient way to obtain circularly polarized emitters.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Characterization of Native Bacterial Biofilms via Dynamic Nuclear Polarization&#8208;Enhanced Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial biofilms cause persistent infections and contribute to antimicrobial resistance. We utilized for the first time hyperpolarized DNP solid&#8208;state NMR to structurally characterize native bacterial biofilm. We collected 1D/2D spectra within seconds/minutes and detected polysaccharide, protein and other signals. These structural information will boost structure&#8208;guided approaches for combating biofilm&#8208;forming microbes.







Abstract
Bacterial biofilms are major contributors to persistent infections and antimicrobial resistance, posing significant challenges to treatment. However, obtaining high&#8208;resolution structural information on native bacterial biofilms has remained elusive due to the methodological limitations associated with analyzing complex biological samples. Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) has shown promise in this regard, but its conventional application is hindered by sensitivity constraints for unlabeled samples. In this study, we utilized high&#8208;sensitivity Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) ssNMR to characterize native Pseudomonas fluorescens colony biofilms. The ~75&#8208;fold sensitivity enhancement provided by DNP enabled structural characterization without isotope labeling or chemical/physical modification. We successfully collected 1D 13C/15N, and 2D 1H&#8722;13C, 1H&#8722;15N and 13C&#8722;13C ssNMR spectra within seconds, minutes or hours, facilitating the identification and quantification of biofilm extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Additionally, DNP ssNMR allowed quantitative detection of both flexible and rigid biofilm components by favorable freezing conditions. This study represents the first application of ultrasensitive DNP ssNMR to characterize a native bacterial biofilm, significantly expanding the capabilities of ssNMR for analyzing the composition and structure of a wide array of in&#8197;vitro and ex&#8197;vivo biofilms. The versatility of this approach will accelerate structure&#8208;guided efforts to combat infections caused by biofilm&#8208;forming microbes.

         <title>Adjusting TADF and Phosphorescence for Tailored Dynamic Time&#8208;Dependent Afterglow Colored Carbon Dots spanning Full Visible Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Time&#8208;dependent afterglow colored (TDAC) behavior differs from static afterglow by involving wavelength changes, enabling low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;level encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, the existing carbon dot (CD)&#8208;based TDAC materials lack a clear mechanistic explanation and controllable wavelength changes, significantly hindering the progress of practical applications in this field. In this study, we synthesized CDs composites with customizable tunable TDAC wavelengths across the visible region. Furthermore, we elucidated the underlying mechanism of TDAC that exhibits sequential weakening and relative strengthening of long&#8208; and short&#8208;wavelength afterglow centers. This phenomenon arises due to strong emission with a short lifetime originating from long&#8208;wavelength thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), along with weak emission having a longer lifetime originating from short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence. The presence of surface&#8208;rich carboxyl groups on CDs determines the short&#8208;wavelength afterglow in their dispersed state while their high conjugation degree governs the long&#8208;wavelength afterglow in their aggregated state. Additionally, appropriate doping levels of CDs enhance color change phenomena during afterglow. Finally, by embedding CDs into different rigid matrix, the range of afterglow changes can be tailored arbitrarily within the visible light region. Leveraging these exceptional TDAC characteristics has allowed us to successfully develop advanced 4D coding technologies that facilitate multi&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting and dynamic information encryption.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The simple and efficient conversion of carboxylic acids into structurally diverse organic molecules is highly desirable in chemical synthesis. This review covers recent developments in photocatalytic methodology for late&#8208;stage transformations of complex carboxylic acids and their derivatives enabled by radical decarboxylation and deoxygenation, highlighting some representative and significant contributions in this field. These advancements are categorized based on the reactivity patterns exhibited by the carboxylic acids. Several activation modes to generate alkyl or aryl radical intermediates during decarboxylation of carboxylic acids are presented, namely, single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidation, ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT), SET reduction, and energy transfer (EnT) processes. On the other hand, direct activation of C&#8211;O bonds in carboxylic acids mediated by phosphoranyl radicals has been discussed and illustrates their potential synthetic application for the synthesis of complex aldehydes, ketones and amides.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent macrocyclic arenes have attracted increasing interest in macrocyclic and supramolecular chemistry due to their exceptional photophysical properties and versatile applications. Classical macrocyclic arenes modified with fluorescent groups at the upper or bottom rims have long provided valuable platforms across various fields. Recently, a large number of novel fluorescent macrocyclic arenes directly composed of polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic building blocks including naphthalene, anthracene, tetraphenylethene, pyrene, fluorene, carbazole, acridan, phenothiazine, coumarin,&#160; triphenylamine, benzothiadiazole and so on, have been reported, and they have shown specific fluorescent property, and also exhibited broad applications in molecular recognition, sensing, bioimaging and functional materials. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in the synthesis and applications of fluorescent macrocyclic arenes containing polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic skeletons emerged in the past decade. By categorizing these fluorescent macrocyclic arenes based on the different building blocks, this review provides a comprehensive summary of their synthesis, properties and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating Tumor Immunotherapy Through a Synergistic Strategy of Increasing Throttle and Relaxing Brake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor immunotherapy has been widely used clinically, but it is still hindered by weak antitumor immunity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, a kind of simple disodium hydrogen phosphate nanoparticle (Na2HPO4 NP) is prepared to "accelerate" tumor immunotherapy by "increasing throttle" and "relaxing brake" simultaneously. The obtained Na2HPO4 NPs release a large amount of Na+ and HPO42&#8208; ions within tumor cells, thereby activating the caspase 1/GSDMD&#8208;mediated pyroptosis pathway to achieve immune activation. Meanwhile, alkalescent Na2HPO4 NPs can further consume lactic acid through acid&#8208;base neutralization, and regulate adenosine (Ado) metabolism via nanomaterial&#8208;induced biocatalytic process to relieve two&#8208;tier immunosuppression. Collectively, Na2HPO4 NPs effectively activate the antitumor immune process in vivo, and dramatically inhibit primary and distal tumor growth. This work will provide unique inspiration and strategy for the regulation of both positive and negative directions in immunotherapy.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tumor immunotherapy has been widely used clinically, but it is still hindered by weak antitumor immunity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, a kind of simple disodium hydrogen phosphate nanoparticle (Na2HPO4 NP) is prepared to "accelerate" tumor immunotherapy by "increasing throttle" and "relaxing brake" simultaneously. The obtained Na2HPO4 NPs release a large amount of Na+ and HPO42- ions within tumor cells, thereby activating the caspase 1/GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis pathway to achieve immune activation. Meanwhile, alkalescent Na2HPO4 NPs can further consume lactic acid through acid-base neutralization, and regulate adenosine (Ado) metabolism via nanomaterial-induced biocatalytic process to relieve two-tier immunosuppression. Collectively, Na2HPO4 NPs effectively activate the antitumor immune process in vivo, and dramatically inhibit primary and distal tumor growth. This work will provide unique inspiration and strategy for the regulation of both positive and negative directions in immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2H&#8208;NMR as a Practical Tool for Following MOF Formation: A Case Study of UiO&#8208;66</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing the mechanism for MOF formation is crucial for the rapid development of new materials. This work demonstrates that Deuterium&#8208;NMR spectroscopy is the optimal inter&#8208;laboratory methodology for understanding the in&#8208;situ kinetics of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) formation. This method is facile, affordable, and allows for the isolation and monitoring of individual reagents by using one deuterated component while the remaining components are protonated. This study utilizes 2H&#8208;NMR, via the spectrometer&#8217;s lock channel, to investigate the formation of UiO&#8208;66 as influenced by different modulators: acetic acid, benzoic acid, and hydrochloric acid. By monitoring the concentration of the deuterated linker and observing the chemical shift and peak width of deuterated water over time, key elements of the mechanism are unraveled. Paradoxically, conditions that cause the ligand to be consumed more slowly result in MOFs forming more quickly and with fewer defects. This phenomenon is attributed to the dissociative mechanism associated with the Zr(IV)&#8208;containing node.</dc:description>

         <title>Semirational Protein Engineering of a Decarboxylative Aldolase for Regiodivergent and Stereodivergent Synthesis of Cyclic Imino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aldolases are powerful C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming enzymes for asymmetric organic synthesis because of their supreme stereoselectivity, diverse electrophiles and nucleophiles, and promising scalability. Stereodivergent engineering of aldolases to tune the selectivity for the synthesis of stereoisomers of chiral molecules is highly desirable but has rarely been reported. This study documented the semirational engineering of the decarboxylative aldolase UstD with the focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM) strategy to perform a C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reaction with dione electrophiles. The variant obtained from a small mutant library showed divergent regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity to the wild&#8208;type enzyme, which resulted in the production of thirty cyclic imino acids with stereocenters at the &#945; and &#947; positions. Molecular dynamics simulation and kinetic data revealed the basis of selectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards straightforward and efficient preparations of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides/proteins, here we reported a chemical O&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation reaction. Promoted by the cocktail of ionic liquids, the reaction proceeds highly efficiently, achieving yields of up to 94&#8201;% with &#945;&#8201;:&#8201;&#946; ratios ranging from 88&#8201;:&#8201;12 to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1, and tunable stereoselectivity. This method significantly simplifies the production of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides/proteins from NAD+, enabling multi&#8208;purpose applications.







Abstract
ADP&#8208;ribosylation is a complex post&#8208;translational modification involved in key physiological processes and associated with various health and disease states. The growing interest in ADP&#8208;ribosylation necessitates straightforward and efficient synthetic methods for the preparation of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides/proteins. In this study, we report a facile reaction between nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and alcohols promoted by a combination of ionic liquids, yielding up to 94&#8201;% with &#945;&#8201;:&#8201;&#946; ratios ranging from 88&#8201;:&#8201;12 to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 and a switchable configuration selectivity. This method significantly simplifies the production of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides and proteins, enabling diverse applications. It allows detailed investigation of side&#8208;chain structure&#8211;activity relationships, facilitates two&#8208;step clickable conjugation of ADP&#8208;ribosyl groups to proteins, and, for the first time, enables non&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides/proteins from natural counterparts and NAD+.

         <title>Covalent Adaptable Poly[2]rotaxane Networks via Dynamic C&#8722;N Bond Transalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent adaptable networkshave been created that feature oligo[2]rotaxane backbones densely integrated with mechanical bonds and cross&#8208;linked through dynamic C&#8722;N bonds. The oligo[2]rotaxane backbones provide mechanical robustness and enable unique mechanical adaptability through the dissociation of host&#8211;guest interactions followed by a sliding motion. The dynamic C&#8722;N bond transalkylation at 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium sites imparts the material with excellent reprocessability.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs), a novel class of crosslinked polymers with dynamic covalent bonds, have gained significant attention for combining the durability of thermosets with the reprocessability of thermoplastics, making them promising for emerging applications. Here, we report the first example of poly[2]rotaxane&#8208;type covalent adaptable networks (PRCANs), in which oligo[2]rotaxane backbones characterized by densely packed mechanical bonds, are cross&#8208;linked through dynamic C&#8722;N bonds. The oligo[2]rotaxane backbones could guarantee the mechanical properties of the CANs. Under an external force, the synergy of numerous microscopic motions of the cascade [2]rotaxane units, progressively introducing the initially hidden short chains, expands the polymer network, imparting good stretchability to the PRCANs (217&#8201;%). On the other hand, the dissociation of host&#8208;guest recognition, followed by the motion of mechanical bonds, constitutes a unique energy dissipation pathway, ultimately enhancing the toughness of PRCANs (7.6&#8197;MJ/m3). In contrast, the control CAN, which lacks movable mechanical bonds, demonstrates significantly lower stretchability (40&#8201;%) and toughness (1.5&#8197;MJ/m3). Moreover, the dynamic C&#8722;N bond can undergo high efficiency of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole alkylation and trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation exchanges at 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium sites at elevated temperatures, with good reprocessability and without compromising their mechanical performance. This work demonstrates the great potential of oligo[2]rotaxanes as a novel polymer backbone for the development of sustainable materials with excellent mechanical properties.

         <title>Photoinduced Energy/Electron Transfer within Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced energy/electron transfer (PET) is critically enhanced by confining the reactive molecules within a single&#8208;chain nanoparticle (SCNP) environment.







Abstract
We demonstrate that single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) &#8211; compact covalently folded single polymer chains &#8211; can increase photocatalytic performance of an embedded catalytic center, compared to the comparable catalytic system in free solution. In particular, we demonstrate that the degree of compaction allows to finely tailor the catalytic activity, thus evidencing that molecular confinement is a key factor in controlling photocatalysis. Specifically, we decorate a linear parent polymer with both photoreactive chalcone moieties as well as Ru(bpy)3 catalytic centers. We initially construct a SCNP via a photosensitized [2+2] cycloaddition at 510&#8197;nm and demonstrate that the SCNP formation is substantially more efficient when the Ru(bpy)3 units are part of the polymer chain instead of as free molecules in solution. Subsequently, we employ the same Ru(bpy)3 units as photocatalysts in a model reaction employing pyrene units as charge transfer moieties. We establish that the photocatalytic activity increases as the polymer becomes more compact, reaching peak efficiency, followed by a subsequent decline as the SCNP becomes too compact. Thus, we identify a goldilocks regime of catalyst confinement via SCNP compaction for use in photocatalysis.

New 1.5D chiral hybrid perovskites, (R/S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4, feature a hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;network&#8208;induced arrangement of zigzag 1D inorganic chains forming a layered architecture. They exhibit long spin lifetimes, stable spin polarization retention, and a remarkable CISS effect with maximum spin polarization degrees of 92&#8201;%&#8211;94&#8201;%, highlighting their potential for spintronics and the vital role of chemical environment in sculpturing spin property of chiral perovskites.







Abstract
In this study, we developed new chiral hybrid perovskites, (R/S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4, by incorporating achiral guanidinium (GA+) and chiral R/S&#8208;methylbenzylammonium (R/S&#8208;MBA+) into the perovskite framework. The resulting materials possess a distinctive structural configuration, positioned between 1D and 2D perovskites, which we describe as 1.5D. This structure is featured by a hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;network&#8208;induced arrangement of zigzag inorganic chains, further forming an organized layered architecture. The structural dimensionality affects both electronic and spin&#8208;related properties. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal Rashba splitting induced by the inversion asymmetry of the crystal structure, while circularly polarized transient absorption spectroscopy confirms spin lifetime on the nanosecond timescale. Magnetic conductive&#8208;probe atomic force microscopy (mCP&#8208;AFM) measurements demonstrate exceptional chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) with maximum spin polarization degrees of (92&#177;1)% and (&#8722;94&#177;2)% for (R&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4 and (S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4, respectively. These findings underscore the potential of (R/S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4 as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation spintronic devices, also highlight the critical role of chemical environment in sculpturing the structural dimension and spin&#8208;polarized property of chiral perovskites.

         <title>Tailored Polymer&#8208;Inorganic Bilayer SEI with Proton Holder Feature for Aqueous Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional SEI&#160;in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries mainly acts as a physical barrier to prevent HER, which is prone to structural deterioration stemming from uneven Zn deposition at high current densities. Herein, we propose an in&#8208;situ structural design of polymer&#8208;inorganic bilayer SEI with a proton holder feature by aniline&#8208;modulated electrolytes. The inner ZnF2 with high stiffness and strength effectively suppresses Zn dendrites. And the outer PANI regulates the current distribution and delays the Sand's time of dendrites growth. The =N&#8208; in PANI is capable of reversible proton holder, thereby inhibiting HER. With this bilayer SEI, the Zn anode achieves an impressive cycle life of 126 h under 40 mA cm&#8208;2 &amp; 40 mAh cm&#8208;2 (DOD=70.8%), solving the bottleneck of single&#8208;layer inorganic SEI that could not be cycled under these conditions. The Zn||NaVO pouch battery with bilayer SEI exhibits a high capacity of 1.2 Ah and a cycle life of 350 h with 78% capacity retention. At &#8208;30&#176;C, the battery delivers a capacity of 335 mAh and a cycle life of 507 h with 72% capacity retention. Our findings offer profound insights into the design of SEI with tailored structure and functionality, paving the way for the next generation of advanced batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Water Orientation in Neutral Oxygen Catalysis for Reversible Ampere&#8208;scale Zinc&#8208;air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The neutral oxygen catalysis is an electrochemical reaction of the utmost importance in energy generation, storage application, and chemical synthesis. However, the restricted availability of protons poses a challenge to achieving kinetically favorable oxygen catalytic reactions. Here, we alter the interfacial water orientation by adjusting the Br&#248;nsted acidity at the catalyst surface, to break the proton transfer limitation of neutral oxygen electrocatalysis. An unexpected role of water molecules in improving the activity of neutral oxygen catalysis is revealed, namely, increasing the H&#8208;down configuration water in electric double layers rather than merely affecting the energy barriers for reaction limiting steps. The proposed porous nanofibers with atomically dispersed MnN3 exhibit record&#8208;breaking activity (EORR@1/2/EOER@10 mA = 0.85/1.65 V vs. RHE) and reversibility (2500 h), outperforming all previously reported neutral catalysts and rivaling conventional alkaline systems. In particular, practical ampere&#8208;scale zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) stack are constructed with a capacity of 5.93 Ah and can stably operate under 1.0 A and 1.0 Ah conditions, demonstrating broad application prospects. This work provides a novel and feasible perspective for designing neutral oxygen electrocatalysts and reveals the future commercial potential in mobile power supply and large&#8208;scale energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Built&#8208;In&#160;Electric Field Strength in Ru/RuO2&#160;Interfaces through Ni Doping to Enhance Hydrogen Conversion at&#160;Ampere&#8208;level&#160;Current</title>

         <dc:description>Improving the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)&#160;efficiency is essential for developing advanced anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) that operate at industrial ampere&#8208;level currents. Herein, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify Ni&#8208;RuO2&#160;as the leading candidate among various 3d transition metal&#8208;doped M&#8208;RuO2&#160;(where metal M includes Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn). The incorporation of Ni atoms facilitates the partial reduction of RuO2, resulting in the formation of a Ni&#8208;Ru/RuO2&#160;interface having a significant built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical reactions. The resulted BIEF enhances electron transfer across the interface, which is critical in lowering energy barriers and accelerating the hydrogen evolution reaction&#160;(HER)&#160;kinetics. As a result, the Ni&#8208;RuO2&#160;catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 134 mV at 1 A cm&#8208;2&#160;and a low Tafel slope of 20.85 mV dec&#8208;1, with just 0.03 mg cm&#8208;2&#160;of Ru loading. The highly effective BIEF, therefore, plays a pivotal role in the catalyst's remarkable performance, allowing the Ni&#8208;RuO2&#8208;based AEMWE to require only 1.71V to maintain stable operation at 1 A cm&#8208;2&#160;over a 1000&#8208;hour period.</dc:description>

         <title>Pi&#8208;Stacking Geometry Directed Supramolecular Secondary Building Units Shaping Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks for Intensive NH3 Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting supramolecular secondary building units (SSBUs) for developing porous crystalline materials represents an exciting breakthrough that extends the boundaries of reticular chemistry. However, shaping polynuclear clusters sustained by non&#8208;covalent interactions for the assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks remains a critical challenge. This study presents a novel strategy to stabilize SSBUs by tuning the &#960;&#8208;stacking geometry of conjugated building blocks, facilitating the creation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks with tailored architectures for demanding gas separation. Specifically, parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stackings of aromatic heterocycles bearing carboxyls promote the formation of SSBUs bridged by ammonium cations [NH4+]8[COO&#8208;]8 (SSBU&#8208;4), enabling the assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks with permanent porosity and structural diversity influenced by the solvent effect. Comparatively, the non&#8208;heterocyclic building units exhibit geometrically&#8208; or energetically&#8208;unfavorable &#960; stackings, resulting in fragile frameworks that collapse after removing disordered guests. Significantly, the heterocycle conjugated frameworks contain abundant open Br&#248;nsted acid N&#8208;H sites within pore channels, demonstrating remarkable NH3 adsorption ability among diverse industrial gases with a high capacity (275.7 mL/g, at 273 K, 100 kPa) as compared to reported porous molecular crystals.</dc:description>

Specifically, parallel-displaced &#960;-&#960; stackings of aromatic heterocycles bearing carboxyls promote the formation of SSBUs bridged by ammonium cations [NH4+]8[COO-]8 (SSBU-4), enabling the assembly of hydrogen-bonded frameworks with permanent porosity and structural diversity influenced by the solvent effect.

         <title>Retrieving the Stability and Practical Performance of Activation&#8208;Unstable Mesoporous Zr(IV)&#8208;MOF for Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Calibrating Acidity Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical applications of activation&#8208;unstable mesoporous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are often constrained by their structural instability. However, enhancing their stability could unlock valuable functionalities. Herein, we stabilized the otherwise unstable, post&#8208;activated structure of a novel mesoporous Zr(IV)&#8208;MOF, NKM&#8208;809, which uses a pyridine&#8208;containing amphiprotic linker (PPTB). We applied two strategies: mixed&#8208;linker synthesis and linker installation. In the mixed&#8208;linker approach, we incorporated an auxiliary linker, TPTB, which resembles PPTB, during synthesis to improve the framework's stability. In the linker installation approach, we introduced a ditopic carboxylate linker (BPDC) into the coordination&#8208;unsaturated sites of NKM&#8208;809. These strategies produced stabilized derivatives, named NKM&#8208;808.X (X = &#967;PPTB) and NKM&#8208;809&#8208;BPDC, which exhibit pH&#8208;responsive dual&#8208;wavelength fluorescence at distinct emission wavelengths. Remarkably, these emissions shift oppositely upon protonation and dissociation, distinguishing them as highly sensitive, self&#8208;calibrating acidity sensors. In NKM&#8208;809&#8208;BPDC, an additional quenching of the linker&#8208;emission (419 nm) minimizes inherent interference, enabling integrated quality and lifespan self&#8208;monitoring. Theoretical calculations identified transitions between (n, &#960;*) and (&#960;, &#960;*) emission states during the sensing process and highlighted the role of a stable mesoporous network in achieving stronger protonation response. These findings showcase the potential of stabilized mesoporous MOFs for practical applications, alongside valuable insights into strategies for optimizing such materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of an Ultrafast and Controlled Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Photoiniferter RAFT Polymerization for Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (PISA)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, we designed a new xanthate RAFT agent by introducing (5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;2&#8208;naphthalenyl)oxy (TNO) as the Z group, namely 2&#8208;[(((5,6,7,8&#8208;Tetrahydro&#8208;2&#8208;naphthalenyl)oxycarbonothioyl)thio)ethyl propanoate] (TNXEP). Due to the presence of the TNO group, TNXEP enabled highly controlled and ultrafast photoiniferter RAFT polymerization under violet (&#955; = 405 nm) and blue (&#955; = 450 nm) light. This approach was effectively extended to aqueous media for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA), facilitating the synthesis of polymeric nanoparticles. Leveraging the rapid photolysis and extended absorption of TNXEP, we demonstrated the first photoiniferter PISA system realizing ultrafast polymerization (&gt; 90% monomer conversion in minutes) under visible light irradiation. Enhanced visible light penetration improved photopolymerization uniformity, enabling rapid and scalable production of polymeric nanoparticles at a 30 g scale in just 10 minutes, with tunable morphologies, including spheres, worms, and vesicles.</dc:description>

         <title>An sp2 Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework for Fusing Lipid Droplets and Engineered Macrophage Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineered immune cell therapy has proven to be a transformative cancer treatment despite the challenges of its prohibitive costs and manufacturing complexity. In this study, we propose a concise &#8220;lipid droplet fusion&#8221; strategy for engineering macrophages. Because of the integration of hydrophobic alkyl chains and &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures, the mildly synthesized sp2C&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) UM&#8208;101 induced lipid droplet fusion and metabolic reprogramming of macrophages, thus promoting their antitumor classical activation. Intravenous injection of UM&#8208;101&#8211;engineered macrophages effectively inhibited tumor progression. These results represent the first report of room&#8208;temperature synthesis of sp2C&#8208;conjugated COFs for engineered immune cell therapy, providing a new perspective for the development of therapeutic immune cells via organelle manipulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dendritic Platinum Nanoparticles Shielded by Pt&#8208;S PEGylation as Intracellular Reactors for Bioorthogonal Uncaging Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Beyond their classical role as cytotoxics, Platinum (Pt) coordination complexes recently joined the selected group of transition metals capable of performing bioorthogonal reactions in living environments. To minimize their reactivity towards nucleophiles, which limit their catalytic performance, we investigated the use of Pt(0) with different forms, sizes and surface functionalization. We report herein the development of PEGylated Pt nanodendrites with the capacity to activate prodyes and prodrugs in cell culture and in vivo. Their dendritic morphology together with their surface shielding through Pt&#8208;S&#8208;bonded PEGylation synergistically contributed to create catalytic nanoreactors compatible with the highly&#8208;crowded and reductive environment of the cell cytoplasm, thereby facilitating in situ bioorthogonal drug uncaging in cancer cells in 2D and 3D culture, including in microfluidic systems, and xenografted in zebrafish.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of Nanoscale Metal Borides for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoscale metal borides, with exceptional physicochemical properties, have been attracted widespread attention. However, traditional synthesis methods of metal borides often lead to surface coking and large particle sizes. Herein, we have employed a flash Joule heating (FJH) technique to enable the ultrafast synthesis of metal boride nanomaterials. The synthesized materials encompass a wide range of diverse categories, including alkaline&#8208;earth metal borides (CaB6), transition metal borides (TiB2, VB2, CrB2, MoB, MoB2, MnB2, MnB4, FeB, CoB, NiB), noble&#8208;metal borides (RuB2, RuB1.1), and rare&#8208;earth metal borides (LaB6, CeB6). As an example, the RuB2 demonstrates highly desirable electrocatalytic performance for all&#8208;pH hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Especially, under the acidic condition, it exhibits an overpotential as low as 15 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2, with a nearly 100% faradic efficiency. Additionally, in situ Raman spectra confirm that both Ru and B sites serve as active sites for the HER. Moreover, the stability of RuB2 can be further enhanced by optimizing the microenvironments of the anolyte composition (H+, K+). More importantly, the experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the co&#8208;existence of H+ and K+ localized around the RuB2 plays a crucial role in further enhancing the stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Passivating Lattice Oxygen in ZnO Nanocrystals to Reduce its Interactions with the Key Intermediates for a Selective Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An&#160;inevitable overoxidation process is considered as one of the most challenging problems in the direct conversion of methane (CH4) to methanol (CH3OH), which is limited by the uncontrollable cracking of key intermediates. Herein, we have successfully constructed a photocatalyst, the Fe&#8208;doped ZnO hollow polyhedron (Fe/ZnOHP), for the highly selective photoconversion of CH4 to CH3OH under mild conditions.&#160;In&#8208;situ experiments and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the introduction of Fe was able to decrease the energy level of the O 2p orbital, which passivated the activity of lattice oxygen in ZnO nanocrystals. This passivation effect greatly weakened the interaction between *CH3 and lattice oxygen, thus facilitating the conversion of *CH3O to *CH3 intermediate rather than the direct desorption of *CH3O. As a result, Fe/ZnOHP exhibited excellent CH3OH generation rate (ca. 1009 &#956;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8208;1) and selectivity (ca. 96%) in the photocatalytic conversion of CH4 at room temperature and low pressure.</dc:description>

         <title>Proximal Oblique&#8208;Packing of Heptamethine Cyanines through Spiro&#8208;Connection Boosts Triplet State Generation in Near&#8208;Infrared</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) triplet dyes are the cornerstones of cutting&#8208;edge biomedical and material applications. The difficulty in rational development of triplet dyes increases exponentially as the absorption wavelength shifts deeper into the NIR range. Although classical H&#8208;/J&#8208;typed packing of NIR dyes has the potential to enhance intersystem crossing (ISC) compared with that in single&#8208;chromophore dyes, the triplet state quantum yields remain limited in such strategy. Herein, proximal oblique&#8208;packed (V&#8208;shaped) heptamethine cyanines (SZ780) through spiro&#8208;connection were achieved. Multi&#8208;channel ultrafast ISC were direct observed in SZ780 and a record high ISC rate constant (up to ~1011 s&#8208;1) is registered among all the reported NIR triplet dyes. SZ780 exhibits a triplet state quantum yield of 18.9% upon excitation at 750 nm, which is almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the monomer (IR780, 2.1%) and nearly threefold increase compared to that of the H&#8208;packed dimer (SC780) (6.7%). Moreover, SZ780 efficiently generates singlet oxygen under 808 nm light irradiation, inducing cancer cell apoptosis in vivo. These findings demonstrate that constructing V&#8208;aggregated dyes system by spiro&#8208;connection offers a powerful approach for the design of high&#8208;performance NIR triplet sensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Control of Self&#8208;Assembly Pathway in Dual Dynamic Covalent Polymeric Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetically controlled self&#8208;assembly is garnering increasing interest in the field of supramolecular polymers and materials, yet examples involving dynamic covalent exchange remain relatively unexplored. Here we report an unexpected dynamic covalent polymeric system whose aqueous self&#8208;assembly pathway is strongly influenced by the kinetics of evaporation of water. The key design is to integrate dual dynamic covalent bonds&#8212;including disulfide bonds and boroxine/borate&#8212;into a dynamic equilibrium system of monomers, polymers, and materials. This dual dynamic covalent design allows polymer growth and crosslinking to occur with the same spatiotemporal characteristics, governed solely by solvent evaporation. We found that a single building block can assemble into two distinct types of polymeric materials, each characterized by unique crosslinking topologies, orders, solubility, and macroscopic properties. The dual dynamic nature of the materials imparts them with intrinsic reconfigurability, such as interfacial repairability and close&#8208;loop chemical recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metastable State Facilitates Low Temperature CO Oxidation over Pt Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic response of heterogeneous catalytic materials to their environment opens a wide variety of possible surface states which may have increased catalytic activity. In this work, we find that it is possible to generate a surface state with increased catalytic activity over metallic 2nm Pt nanoparticles by performing a thermal treatment of the CO*&#8208;covered Pt catalyst. This state is characterised by its ability to oxidise CO to CO2 at room temperature. By combining pressure pulse experiments with in situ spectroscopy we correlate the formation of this high&#8208;activity state with the desorption of weakly bound CO* molecules from well&#8208;coordinated Pt sites. This high&#8208;activity state is metastable, degrading after elevated thermal treatments or upon readsorption of CO at room temperature. We conclude that this metastable state is highly localised to the surface of the nanoparticle, however its exact atomic structure remains open to speculation.</dc:description>

         <title>Building Three&#8208;Dimensional Complexity by Intramolecular 2&#8208;Aminoallyl Cation&#8211;Diene (4 + 3) Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reliable methods for rapidly constructing C(sp3)&#8208;rich three&#8208;dimensional polycycles are in high demand for organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Although there are various mature systems for synthesizing five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered polycycles, a catalytic platform for accessing diverse cycloheptanoid&#8208;containing polycyclic scaffolds is lacking. Herein, we describe a method for copper&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular 2&#8208;aminoallyl cation&#8211;diene (4 + 3) cycloaddition reactions. By using 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;tethered ethynyl methylene cyclic carbamates as substrates, we were able to construct various cycloheptanoid&#8208;containing polycyclic scaffolds, which are present in many bioactive molecules. The cycloaddition products were rich in functionality that could undergo various chemical transformations. The synthetic utility of the method was illustrated by total synthesis of the natural products (&#177;)&#8208;mint ketone and (&#177;)&#8208;aphanamol I. Mechanistic studies indicated that the cycloadditions proceed via a concerted [4&#960; + 2&#960;] mechanism and that an endo&#8208;selective pathway is favored.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Tension&#8208;Strained Copper Concentrates Diluted Cations for Selective Proton&#8208;Exchange Membrane CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolysis of carbon dioxide (CO2) in acid offers a promising route to overcome CO2 loss in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, but requires concentrated alkali cations (typical &#8805;3 M) to mitigate the trade&#8208;off between low pH and high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate, causing salt precipitation. Here we report a strategy to resolve this problem by introducing tensile strain in a copper (Cu) catalyst, which can selectively reduce CO2 to valuable multicarbon products, particularly ethylene, in a pH 1 electrolyte with 1 M potassium ions. We find that the tension&#8208;strained Cu creates an electron&#8208;rich surface that concentrates diluted potassium ions, contributing to CO2 activation and HER suppression. With this catalyst, we show constant ethylene Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 44.3% over 100 hours at 400 mA cm&#8208;2 and a cell voltage of 3.1 volts in a proton&#8208;exchange membrane electrolyser. Moreover, selective electrosynthesis of ethylene oxide using the as&#8208;produced ethylene was demonstrated in an integrated system.</dc:description>
