         <title>Catalyst Control over Threefold Stereogenicity: Selective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Sulfones with Stereogenic C&#8211;S Axes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst control over higher&#8208;order stereogenicity addresses significantly extended stereochemical space, but selective methods to govern threefold stereogenic units remained elusive. Herein, we report the stereoselective synthesis of threefold stereogenic triptycyl sulfones with atropisomerism arising from a C(sp3)&#8211;S bond. An oxidation of a stereodynamic thioether controlled by a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst allowed to selectively access enantioenriched triptycyl sulfoxides. The ensuing enantiospecific and diastereoselective catalytic oxidation to a threefold stereogenic sulfone provided overall control over the stereogenic C&#8211;S axis. All three stereoisomers were addressable with enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergence and a stereoselectivity of up to (&#8211;sc):(+sc):(ap)=94:6:&lt;1.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs) have become one of the significantly strategical flexible energy&#8208;storage materials towards future wearable textile electronics and metaverse technologies. Here, we develop the high&#8208;performance FSCs based on multiscale dot&#8208;wire&#8208;sheet heterostructure microfiber of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dots&#8208;Ti3C2Tx/silk nanofibers (NCDs&#8208;Ti3C2Tx/SNFs) hybrids via microfluidic fabrication. Due to the enlarged interlayer spacing, plentiful porous channels, accelerated H+ ion transport dynamics, large electrical conductivity and excellent mechanical strength/flexibility, the NCDs&#8208;Ti3C2Tx/SNFs possesses high volumetric capacitance (2218.7 F cm&#8208;3) and reversible charge&#8208;discharge stability in 1M H2SO4 electrolyte. Furthermore, the solid&#8208;state FSCs present high energy density (57.9 mWh cm&#8208;3), good capacitance (1157 F cm&#8208;3), long&#8208;life cycles (82.3% capacitance retention after 40000 cycles), which realize the actual energy&#8208;supply applications (powering lamp, watch and toy car).</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering an Oxygen&#8208;Binding Protein for Photocatalytic CO2 Reductions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While native CO2&#8208;reducing enzymes display remarkable catalytic efficiency and product selectivity, few artificial biocatalysts have been engineered to allow understanding how the native enzymes work. To address this issue, we report cobalt porphyrin substituted myoglobin (CoMb) as a homogeneous catalyst for photo&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion in water. The activity and product selectivity were optimized by varying pH and concentrations of the enzyme and the photosensitizer. Up to 2000 TON(CO) was attained at low enzyme concentrations with low product selectivity (15%), while a product selectivity of 74% was reached by increasing the enzyme loading but with a compromised TON(CO). The efficiency of CO generation and overall TON(CO) were further improved by introducing positively charged residues (Lys or Arg) near the active stie of CoMb, which demonstrates the value of tuning the enzyme secondary coordination sphere to enhance the CO2 reducing performance of a protein&#8208;based photocatalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Automated Microfluidic&#8208;based Platforms: Optimizing Hydrogenation Efficiency of Nitrobenzene through &#960;&#8208;&#960; Interactions in Pd Nanoparticles on Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Microplatform with timed automata has been leveraged for guiding the preparation of molecules, whereas the requirement of handling expertise and sophisticated instrument is inevitable in combination with heterogeneous catalysis. Here we report a microfluidic&#8208;based autolab with open structures, called Put &amp; Play Automated Microplatform (PPAM). It shows the efficient hydrogenation performance of palladium nanoparticles on the triphenylene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (Pd/TP&#8208;COFs) in which the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions of TP rings in the vicinity of Pd is optimized by easy change&#8208;over of catalyst and simple tuning of reactor geometries in PPAM. Using experiment/simulation of the Pd/TP&#8208;COFs coating (PCC) and mixing (PCM) across PPAM with different channel sizes, the turnover frequencies are 60 times the commonly used batch reactor, and aniline productivity of 8.8 g h&#8722;1 is achieved in 0.09 cm3. This work will raise awareness about the benefits of the catalyst&#8208;loaded microplatform in future materials performance campaigns.</dc:description>

         <title>Mimicking Photosynthesis: A Natural Z&#8208;Scheme Photocatalyst Constructed from Red Mud Bauxite Waste for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalysts have attracted significant attention due to their great potential for solar fuel production. However, delicately coupling two individual semiconductors with a charge shuttle by a material strategy remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a new protocol of natural Z&#8208;Scheme heterostructures by strategically engineering the component and interfacial structure of red mud bauxite waste. Advanced characterizations elucidated that the hydrogen&#8208;induced formation of metallic Fe enabled the effective Z&#8208;Scheme electron transfer from Fe2O3 to TiO2, leading to the significantly boosted spatial separation of photo&#8208;generated carriers for overall water splitting. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first Z&#8208;Scheme heterojunction based on natural minerals for solar fuel production. Thus our work provides a new avenue toward the utilization of natural minerals for advanced catalysis applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Drug Efficacy Guided by Free Energy Simulations of the &#946;2&#8208;Adrenoceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCR) play important roles in physiological processes and are modulated by drugs that either activate or block signaling. Rational design of the pharmacological efficacy profiles of GPCR ligands could enable the development of more efficient drugs, but is challenging even if high&#8208;resolution receptor structures are available. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of the &#946;2 adrenergic receptor (&#946;2R) in active and inactive conformations to assess if binding free energy calculations can predict differences in ligand efficacy for closely related compounds. Previously identified ligands were successfully classified into groups with comparable efficacy profiles based on the calculated shift in ligand affinity upon activation. A series of ligands were then predicted and synthesized, leading to the discovery of partial agonists with nanomolar potencies and novel scaffolds. Our results demonstrate that free energy simulations enable design of ligand efficacy and the same approach can be applied to other GPCR drug targets.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Nitrile compounds containing ester and amide groups are important functionalized chemicals in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. In this article, an efficient and convenient palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative procedure toward 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N&#8208;acetamide and 2&#8208;cyanoacetate compounds has been developed. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions via radical intermediate which is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization. Gram&#8208;scale experiment was performed successfully under low catalyst loading and gave the target product in excellent yield. Additionally, this transformation can be performed under atmospheric pressure and provide alternative routes to 7 drug precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Acyclic All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters and 1,3&#8208;Nonadjacent Stereoelements via Organo/Metal Dual Catalyzed Asymmetric Allenylic Substitution of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the asymmetric construction of functionalized acyclic all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters and 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereoelements has been developed via organo/metal dual catalyzed asymmetric allenylic substitution of branched and linear aldehydes, by developing an unknown acyclic secondary&#8208;secondary diamine as the enabling organocatalyst. Although it is believed that secondary&#8208;secondary diamines are difficult to be used as the organocatalysts in organo/metal dual catalysis, this study demonstrates that such diamines can be successfully combined with a metal catalyst in organo/metal dual catalysis. Our study enables the asymmetric construction of two important classes of motifs which were previously difficult to access, axially chiral allene&#8208;containing acyclic all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters and 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereoelements bearing allenyl axial chirality&#160;and central chirality, in good yields with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Six&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;TeB5Cl5 (1) and twelve&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;TeB11Cl11 (2) telluraboranes have been prepared via co&#8208;pyrolysis of B2Cl4 with TeCl4in vacuo at temperatures between 360&#186;C and 400&#176;C. Both compounds are sublimable, off&#8208;white solids, and they have been characterized by one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional 11B&#8208;NMR and high&#8208;resolution mass spectroscopy. Both ab initio/GIAO/NMR and DFT/ZORA/NMR computations support octahedral and icosahedral geometries for 1 and 2, respectively, as expected due to their closo&#8208;electron counts. The octahedral structure of 1 has been confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction on an incommensurately modulated crystal. The corresponding bonding properties have been analyzed in terms of the intrinsic bond orbital (IBO) approach. 1 is the first example of a polyhedral telluraborane with a cluster size smaller than 11 vertices.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Nano&#8208;Roughening of Gold Microstructured Electrodes for Enhanced Sensing in Biofluids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A key challenge for sensor miniaturization is to create electrodes with smaller footprint, while maintaining or increasing sensitivity. In this work, the electroactive surface of Au electrodes was enhanced 30&#8208;fold by wrinkling followed by chronoamperometric (CA) pulsing. Electron microscopy showed increased surface roughness in response to an increased number of CA pulses. The nanoroughened electrodes also showed excellent fouling resistance when submerged in solutions containing bovine serum albumin. The nanoroughened electrodes were used for electrochemical detection of the Cu2+ in tap water and of glucose in human blood plasma. In the latter case, the nanoroughened electrodes allowed highly sensitive enzyme&#8208;free sensing of glucose, with responses comparable to that of two commercial enzyme&#8208;based sensors. We anticipate that this methodology to fabricate nanostructured electrodes can accelerate the development of simple, cost&#8208;effective, and high sensitivity electrochemical platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Stochastic Bullvalene Architecture Modulates Structural Rigidity in &#960;&#8208;Rich Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and processing of &#960;&#8208;rich polymers found in novel electronics and textiles is difficult because chain stiffness leads to low solubility and high thermal transitions. The incorporation of &#8220;shape&#8208;shifting&#8221; molecular cages into &#960;&#8208;rich backbone provides an ensemble of structural kinks to modulate chain architecture via a self&#8208;contained library of valence isomers. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of (bullvalene&#8208;co&#8208;phenylene)s that feature smaller persistence lengths than a prototypical rigid rod polymer, poly(p&#8208;phenylene). By varying the amount of bullvalene incorporation within a poly(p&#8208;phenylene) chain (0 &#8211; 50%), we can tune thermal properties and solution&#8208;state conformation. These features are caused by stochastic bullvalene isomers within the polymer backbone that result in kinked architectures. Synthetically, bullvalene incorporation offers a facile method to decrease structural rigidity within &#960;&#8208;rich materials without concomitant crystallization. VT&#8208;NMR experiments confirm that these materials remain dynamic in solution, offering the opportunity for future stimuli&#8208;responsive applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermo&#8208; and Photocatalytic Activation of CO2 in Ionic Liquids Nano&#8208;domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic liquids (ILs) are considered to be potential material devices for CO2 capturing and conversion to energy&#8208;adducts. They form a cage (confined&#8208;space) around the catalyst providing an ionic nano&#8208;container environment which serves as physical&#8208;chemical barrier that selectively controls the diffusion of reactants, intermediates, and products to the catalytic active sites via their hydrophobicity and contact ion pairs. Hence, the electronic properties of the catalysts in ILs can be tuned by the proper choice of the IL&#8208;cations and anions that strongly influence the residence time/diffusion of the reactants, intermediates, and products in the nano&#8208;environment. On the other hand, ILs provide driving force towards photocatalytic redox process to increase the CO2 photoreduction. By combining ILs with the semiconductor, unique solid semiconductor&#8208;liquid commodities are generated that can lower the CO2 activation energy barrier by modulating the electronic properties of the semiconductor surface. This mini&#8208;review provides a brief overview of the recent advances in IL assisted thermal conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbons, formic acid, methanol, dimethyl carbonate, and cyclic carbonates as well as its photo&#8208;conversion to solar fuels.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Propagation of a Minimal Catalytic RNA Network in GUV Protocells by Temperature Cycling and Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;responsive RNA organelles inside giant unilamellar vesicles were exploited to increase catalytic rates of a minimal catalytic RNA network. Subsequent cycles of freezing and thawing serve as physico&#8208;chemical driver to exchange vesicle contents aiming at an efficient organelle&#8208;aided propagation of such catalytic networks across lipid vesicles.







Abstract
Compartmentalization is key to many cellular processes and a critical bottleneck of any minimal life approach. In cells, a complex chemistry is responsible for bringing together or separating biomolecules at the right place at the right time. Lipids, nucleic acids and proteins self&#8208;organize, thereby creating boundaries, interfaces and specialized microenvironments. Exploiting reversible RNA&#8208;based liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) inside giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), we present an efficient system capable of propagating an RNA&#8208;based enzymatic reaction across a population of GUVs upon freezing&#8208;thawing (FT) temperature cycles. We report that compartmentalization in the condensed RNA&#8208;rich phase can accelerate such an enzymatic reaction. In the decondensed state, RNA substrates become homogeneously dispersed, enabling content exchange between vesicles during freeze&#8208;thawing. This work explores how a minimal reversible phase separation system in lipid vesicles could help to implement spatiotemporal control in cyclic processes, as required for minimal cells.

         <title>Enhanced Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Selectivity of Clamp&#8208;Shaped Cobalt(II) Porphyrin(2.1.2.1) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clamp&#8208;shaped cobalt(II) porphyrins(2.1.2.1) complexes were investigated as to their electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and electrocatalytic ORR. Electrochemistry indicates that the first oxidation corresponds to a CoII/CoIII process. The ORR capacities of both complexes show higher selectively for the 4e&#8722; ORR and DFT calculations suggest a lower overpotential for the 4e&#8722; ORR pathway than for the 2e&#8722; pathway.







Abstract
The molecular structure, electrochemistry, spectroelectrochemistry and electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) features of two CoII porphyrin(2.1.2.1) complexes bearing Ph or F5Ph groups at the two meso&#8208;positions of the macrocycle are examined. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis reveal a highly bent, nonplanar macrocyclic conformation of the complex resulting in clamp&#8208;shaped molecular structures. Cyclic voltammetry paired with UV/Vis spectroelectrochemistry in PhCN/0.1&#8197;M TBAP suggest that the first electron addition corresponds to a macrocyclic&#8208;centered reduction while spectral changes observed during the first oxidation are consistent with a metal&#8208;centered CoII/CoIII process. The activity of the clamp&#8208;shaped complexes towards heterogeneous ORR in 0.1&#8197;M KOH show selectivity towards the 4e&#8722; ORR pathway giving H2O. DFT first&#8208;principle calculations on the porphyrin catalyst indicates a lower overpotential for 4e&#8722; ORR as compared to the 2e&#8722; pathway, consistent with experimental data.

         <title>Spectroscopy vs. Electrochemistry: Catalyst Layer Thickness Effects on Operando/In Situ Measurements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando/in situ spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies often require high loadings and thick catalyst layers (CLs) leading to large ion&#8208; and mass&#8208;transport limitations. In this study we investigate PdH&#8208;formation in two Pd&#8208;catalysts with similar surface areas but drastically different morphologies. Our results unveil that the CL&#8208;thickness largely determines the PdH formation trends calling for the minimization of the CL&#8208;thickness in such experiments.







Abstract
In recent years, operando/in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) has become an important tool in the electrocatalysis community. However, the high catalyst loadings often required to acquire XA&#8208;spectra with a satisfactory signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio frequently imply the use of thick catalyst layers (CLs) with large ion&#8208; and mass&#8208;transport limitations. To shed light on the impact of this variable on the spectro&#8208;electrochemical results, in this study we investigate Pd&#8208;hydride formation in carbon&#8208;supported Pd&#8208;nanoparticles (Pd/C) and an unsupported Pd&#8208;aerogel with similar Pd surface areas but drastically different morphologies and electrode packing densities. Our in situ XAS and rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements with different loadings unveil that the CL&#8208;thickness largely determines the hydride formation trends inferred from spectro&#8208;electrochemical experiments, therewith calling for the minimization of the CL&#8208;thickness in such experiments and the use of complementary thin&#8208;film control measurements.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Hydrophosphinylation of 2&#8208;Vinylazaarenes to Access P&#8208;Chiral 2&#8208;Azaaryl&#8208;Ethylphosphine Oxides</title>

         <dc:description>
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalysed asymmetric hydrophosphinylation of 2&#8208;vinylazaarenes is developed. The method provides a modular and efficient access to P&#8208;chiral 2&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;ethylphosphine oxides while also realizing the precise kinetic resolution of secondary phosphine oxides. Given the verified promise of the chiral phosphines as the chiral ligands, this work considerably enriches the toolkit of asymmetric metal catalysis.







Abstract
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalysed asymmetric hydrophosphinylation of 2&#8208;vinylazaarenes by secondary phosphine oxides is described. A variety of P&#8208;chiral 2&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;ethylphosphine oxides are synthesized with high yields and ees, of which both the substituents of phosphines and azaarenes can be flexibly modulated, underscoring an exceptionally broad scope of substrates. These adducts are valuable to asymmetric metal catalysis since the resultant P&#8208;chiral tertiary phosphines from the reduction of them are verified as a kind of effective C1&#8208;symmetric chiral 1,5&#8208;hybrid P,N&#8208;ligands. Importantly, this catalysis platform enables the generic and efficient kinetic resolution of P&#8208;chiral secondary phosphine oxides. It thus provides an expedient approach to access the enantiomers of the P&#8208;chiral tertiary phosphine oxides derived from asymmetric hydrophosphinylation, further improving the utility of the method.

         <title>Novel Strategy to Drive the Intracellular Uptake of Lipid Nanoparticles for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report a novel aminopolycarboxylic acid lipid&#8208;embedded porphyrin nanoparticle and elucidated its unique cellular delivery mechanism that affords its enhanced intracellular uptake, fast fluorescence activation, and superior photodynamic therapeutic (PDT) efficacy. By exploiting this enhanced delivery strategy, we might overcome challenges associated with intracellular drug delivery to advance therapeutic outcomes.







Abstract
Nanoparticles&#8217; uptake by cancer cells upon reaching the tumor microenvironment is often the rate&#8208;limiting step in cancer nanomedicine. Herein, we report that the inclusion of aminopolycarboxylic acid conjugated lipids, such as EDTA&#8208; or DTPA&#8208;hexadecylamide lipids in liposome&#8208;like porphyrin nanoparticles (PS) enhanced their intracellular uptake by 25&#8208;fold, which was attributed to these lipids&#8217; ability to fluidize the cell membrane in a detergent&#8208;like manner rather than by metal chelation of EDTA or DTPA. EDTA&#8208;lipid&#8208;incorporated&#8208;PS (ePS) take advantage of its unique active uptake mechanism to achieve &gt;95&#8201;% photodynamic therapy (PDT) cell killing compared to &lt;5&#8201;% cell killing by PS. In multiple tumor models, ePS demonstrated fast fluorescence&#8208;enabled tumor delineation within minutes post&#8208;injection and increased PDT potency (100&#8201;% survival rate) compared to PS (60&#8201;%). This study offers a new nanoparticle cellular uptake strategy to overcome challenges associated with conventional drug delivery.

         <title>Systematic Enzymatic Synthesis of dTDP&#8208;Activated Sugar Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the basis of the de novo and salvage biosynthetic pathways, diverse dTDP&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides, which are important but difficult to access, were successfully prepared on a large scale from readily available starting materials. This high&#8208;yielding synthetic strategy avoids the need for complicated purification procedures.







Abstract
Deoxythymidine diphosphate (dTDP)&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides are the most diverse sugar nucleotides in nature. They serve as the glycosylation donors of glycosyltransferases to produce various carbohydrate structures in living organisms. However, most of the dTDP&#8208;sugars are difficult to obtain due to synthetic difficulties. The limited availability of dTDP&#8208;sugars has hindered progress in investigating the biosynthesis of carbohydrates and exploring new glycosyltransferases in nature. In this study, based on the de novo and salvage biosynthetic pathways, a variety of dTDP&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides were successfully prepared in high yields and on a large scale from readily available starting materials. The produced sugar nucleotides could provide effective tools for fundamental research in glycoscience.

         <title>ATRP Enhances Structural Correlations In Polymerization&#8208;Induced Phase Separation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled&#8208;radical polymerization in the solid state is used to induce and arrest the phase separation of highly structurally correlated inclusions. The obtained solid structure is durable and has low size dispersity. It is possible to tune the length scale spontaneously emerging in the system by modifying the synthesis parameters.







Abstract
Synthetic methods to control the structure of materials at sub&#8208;micron scales are typically based on the self&#8208;assembly of structural building blocks with precise size and morphology. On the other hand, many living systems can generate structure across a broad range of length scales in one step directly from macromolecules, using phase separation. Here, we introduce and control structure at the nano&#8208; and microscales through polymerization in the solid state, which has the unusual capability of both triggering and arresting phase separation. In particular, we show that atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) enables control of nucleation, growth, and stabilization of phase&#8208;separated poly&#8208;methylmethacrylate (PMMA) domains in a solid polystyrene (PS) matrix. ATRP yields durable nanostructures with low size dispersity and high degrees of structural correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the length scale of these materials is controlled by the synthesis parameters.

         <title>Transforming Inert Cycloalkanes into &#945;,&#969;&#8208;Diamines by Designed Enzymatic Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general one&#8208;pot in vivo biocatalytic cascade for the production of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diamines as important nylon monomers was developed, starting from cheap and readily available cycloalkanes. The desired &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diamines were successfully produced with the highest biosynthesis productivity to date, thus providing an ecologically viable alternative to the current industrial process for manufacturing &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diamines.







Abstract
Aliphatic &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diamines (DAs) are important monomer precursors that are industrially produced by energy&#8208;intensive, multistage chemical reactions that are harmful to the environment. Therefore, the development of sustainable green DA synthetic routes is highly desired. Herein, we report an efficient one&#8208;pot in vivo biocatalytic cascade for the transformation of cycloalkanes into DAs with the aid of advanced techniques, including the RetroBioCat tool for biocatalytic route design, enzyme mining for finding appropriate enzymes and microbial consortia construction for efficient pathway assembly. As a result, DAs were successfully produced by the designed microbial consortia&#8208;based biocatalytic system. In particular, the highest biosynthesis productivity record of 1,6&#8208;hexanediamine was achieved when using either cyclohexanol or cyclohexane as a substrate. Thus, the developed biocatalytic process provides a promising alternative to the dominant industrial process for manufacturing DAs.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Imaging of Cells and Sub&#8208;Cellular Entities by Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report on label&#8208;free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy using exceptionally low concentrations (nano&#8208; to picomolar) of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ luminophore. This work addresses the central issue of the minimal concentration of the ECL luminophore required to image single entities such as cells or mitochondria.







Abstract
Here we report on a label&#8208;free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy using exceptionally low concentrations of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ luminophore. This work addresses the central point of the minimal concentration of the ECL luminophore required to image single entities. We demonstrate the possibility to record ECL images of cells and mitochondria at concentrations down to nM and pM. This is 7 orders of magnitude lower than classically&#8208;used concentrations and corresponds to a few hundreds of luminophores diffusing around the biological entities. Yet, it produces remarkably sharp negative optical contrast ECL images, as demonstrated by structural similarity index metric analyses and supported by predictions of the ECL image covering time. Finally, we show that the reported approach is a simple, fast, and highly sensitive method, which opens new avenues for ultrasensitive ECL imaging and ECL reactivity at the single molecule level.

         <title>1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Acetylene Enabled by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is the regio&#8208; and stereoselective light&#8208;enabled installation of two distinct sulfides into acetylene. The resulting S&#8208;containing vinyl frameworks are important and versatile scaffolds that can be easily transformed into diverse functionalized molecules and chiral sulfoxide&#8208;containing bidentate ligands. Experimental and theoretical data on the mechanism are reported.







Abstract
Although the direct conversion of gaseous acetylene into value&#8208;added liquid commodity chemicals is becoming increasingly attractive, the majority of the established methodologies are focused on cross&#8208;coupling, hydro&#8208;functionalization, and polymerization. Herein, we describe a 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization method that inserts acetylene directly into readily available bifunctional reagents. This method provides access to diverse C2&#8208;linked 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;heteroatom products in high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity along with opening up previously unexplored synthetic directions. In addition, we demonstrate this method's synthetic potential by converting the obtained products into diverse functionalized molecules and chiral sulfoxide&#8208;containing bidentate ligands. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods, the mechanism for this insertion reaction was investigated.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Activation of Carbon Monoxide: Ketenyl Anions by PPh3/CO Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article highlights the recent findings reported by Gessner and co&#8208;workers in the synthesis of valuable ketenyl anions by an exchange of triphenylphosphine with carbon monoxide at a metaled ylide. The metal ketenyl/ynolate was structurally characterized and used as a reagent in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Ketenes (R2C=C=O) are important reactive intermediates in organic chemistry which are often challenging to access in stable form due to their polarized cumulenic structure and inherent high reactivity. Ketenyl anions (R(M)C=C=O) or metal ynolates (R&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;OM) represent alternative, highly attractive synthetic targets, but are typically prepared in situ and their structure and synthetic access are little investigated. Now, a fundamentally new strategy utilizing an exchange reaction of a phosphine with carbon monoxide at a metalated ylide gives rise to a series of novel ketenyl anions. These compounds are flexible reagents and can easily be transferred with electrophiles into more complex building blocks for synthetic applications. Since carbon monoxide is an inexpensive C1 building block, the new exchange strategy is an elegant concept and a valuable new entry in the synthetic toolbox of organic synthesis.

         <title>Chemical Validation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Phosphopantetheine Adenylyltransferase Using Fragment Linking and CRISPR Interference
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fragment screen yielded three series of Mycobacterium tuberculosis phosphopantetheinyl adenylyltransferase (MtbPPAT) ligands that bind to distinct regions within the active site. This presented a unique opportunity for fragment linking that was exploited for the design of higher affinity ligands, shown, using CRISPR interference, to possess on&#8208;target antimycobacterial activity.







Abstract
The coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis pathway has attracted attention as a potential target for much&#8208;needed novel antimicrobial drugs, including for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), the lethal disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Seeking to identify inhibitors of Mtb phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (MtbPPAT), the enzyme that catalyses the penultimate step in CoA biosynthesis, we performed a fragment screen. In doing so, we discovered three series of fragments that occupy distinct regions of the MtbPPAT active site, presenting a unique opportunity for fragment linking. Here we show how, guided by X&#8208;ray crystal structures, we could link weakly&#8208;binding fragments to produce an active site binder with a KD &lt;20&#8197;&#956;M and on&#8208;target anti&#8208;Mtb activity, as demonstrated using CRISPR interference. This study represents a big step toward validating MtbPPAT as a potential drug target and designing a MtbPPAT&#8208;targeting anti&#8208;TB drug.

&lt;p&gt;A fragment screen yielded three series of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; phosphopantetheinyl adenylyltransferase (&lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;PPAT) ligands that bind to distinct regions within the active site. This presented a unique opportunity for fragment linking that was exploited for the design of higher affinity ligands, shown, using CRISPR interference, to possess on-target antimycobacterial activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis pathway has attracted attention as a potential target for much-needed novel antimicrobial drugs, including for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), the lethal disease caused by &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;). Seeking to identify inhibitors of &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt; phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (&lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;PPAT), the enzyme that catalyses the penultimate step in CoA biosynthesis, we performed a fragment screen. In doing so, we discovered three series of fragments that occupy distinct regions of the &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;PPAT active site, presenting a unique opportunity for fragment linking. Here we show how, guided by X-ray crystal structures, we could link weakly-binding fragments to produce an active site binder with a &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt;20&#8197;&#956;M and on-target anti-&lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt; activity, as demonstrated using CRISPR interference. This study represents a big step toward validating &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;PPAT as a potential drug target and designing a &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;PPAT-targeting anti-TB drug.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spontaneous Proton Chemistry Enables Ultralow&#8208;temperature and Long&#8208;life Aqueous Copper Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu(BF4)2 electrolyte that spontaneously generates protons is developed for ultralow&#8208;temperature copper metal batteries. Benefiting from the excellent thermodynamic stability and low temperature resistance of the electrolyte, the assembled full battery exhibits a extra&#8208;long and stable cycling lifespan over 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C and works well even at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Aqueous copper metal batteries with acidic electrolytes are regarded as promising candidates for low&#8208;temperature energy storage, benefiting from fast kinetics of protons and acid resistance of copper. Here, a Cu(BF4)2 electrolyte that spontaneously generates protons is developed for ultralow&#8208;temperature copper metal batteries. Systematic studies demonstrate that the hydrolysis of BF4&#8722; generates more protons, rendering the Cu(BF4)2 among the most effective aqueous electrolyte capable of breaking hydrogen bonds in water molecules. This electrolyte endows a polyaniline/Cu battery to deliver a short charging time of 21&#8197;s and a charge/discharge capability of up to 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C, along with a high discharge specific capacity of 70&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a supercapacitor&#8208;comparable power density of 3000&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Furthermore, it can exhibit a long and stable cycling lifespan over 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C and works well at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides an opportunity for intrinsically acidic electrolytes.

         <title>Electrically Switchable Persistent Spin Texture in a Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We implement electrically switchable persistent spin texture (PST) in a 2D perovskite ferroelectric, which highlights the potential of 2D ferroelectric PST&#8208;active materials for spin manipulation and facilitates high&#8208;performed spintronic device application.







Abstract
As a momentum&#8208;independent spin configuration, persistent spin texture (PST) could avoid spin relaxation and play an advantageous role in spin lifetime. Nevertheless, manipulation of PST is a challenge due to the limited materials and ambiguous structure&#8211;property relationships. Herein, we present electrically switchable PST in a new 2D perovskite ferroelectric, (PA)2CsPb2Br7 (where PA is n&#8208;pentylammonium), which has a high Curie temperature of 349&#8197;K, evident spontaneous polarization (3.2&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a low coercive electric field of 5.3&#8197;kV&#8201;cm&#8722;1. The combination of symmetry&#8208;breaking in ferroelectrics and effective spin&#8208;orbit field facilitates intrinsic PST in the bulk and monolayer structure models. Strikingly, the directions of spin texture are reversible by switching the spontaneous electric polarization. This electric switching behavior relates to the tilting of PbBr6 octahedra and the reorientation of organic PA+ cations. Our studies on ferroelectric PST of 2D hybrid perovskites afford a platform for electrical spin texture manipulation.

         <title>RAFT&#8208;Mediated Emulsion Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly for the Synthesis of Core&#8208;Degradable Waterborne Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emulsion copolymerization of dibenzo[c,e]oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) with either styrene or n&#8208;butyl acrylate was carried out in water to produce block copolymer nanoparticles via RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA in emulsion. Hydrophilic blocks are either poly(N&#8208;acryloylmorpholine) or poly(ethylene glycol), two polymers largely used for their known biocompatibility. The degradability of the hydrophobic core block is ensured by in&#8208;chain cleavable thioester functions.







Abstract
Poly(N&#8208;acryloylmorpholine) (PNAM)&#8208;decorated waterborne nanoparticles comprising a core of either degradable polystyrene (PS) or poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate) (PBA) were synthesized by polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) in water. A PNAM bearing a trithiocarbonate chain end (PNAM&#8208;TTC) was extended via reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)&#8208;mediated emulsion copolymerization of either styrene (S) or n&#8208;butyl acrylate (BA) with dibenzo[c,e]oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT). Well&#8208;defined amphiphilic block copolymers were obtained. The in situ self&#8208;assembly of these polymers resulted in the formation of stable nanoparticles. The insertion of thioester units in the vinylic blocks enabled their degradation under basic conditions. The same strategy was then applied to the emulsion copolymerization of BA with DOT using a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) equipped with a trithiocarbonate end group, resulting in PEG&#8208;decorated nanoparticles with degradable PBA&#8208;based cores.

         <title>Mitigating Swelling of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase using an Inorganic Anion Switch for Low&#8208;temperature Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inclusion of difluorophosphate anion in the primary solvation sheath of a weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte helps to switch the swelling properties of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on a graphite (Gr) composite anode. By forming a low&#8208;swelling, Li3PO4&#8208;enriched SEI, reversible Li+ (de)intercalation was enabled at a stable Gr&#8208;electrolyte interface, contributing to improved low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance of a Li&#8208;ion battery.







Abstract
In overcoming the Li+ desolvation barrier for low&#8208;temperature battery operation, a weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte based on carboxylate solvent has shown promises. In case of an organic&#8208;anion&#8208;enriched primary solvation sheath (PSS), we found that the electrolyte tends to form a highly swollen, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that shows a high permeability to the electrolyte components, accounting for quickly declined electrochemical performance of graphite&#8208;based anode. Here we proposed a facile strategy to tune the swelling property of SEI by introducing an inorganic anion switch into the PSS, via LiDFP co&#8208;solute method. By forming a low&#8208;swelling, Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI, the electrolyte&#8208;consuming parasitic reactions and solvent co&#8208;intercalation at graphite&#8208;electrolyte interface are suppressed, which contributes to efficient Li+ transport, reversible Li+ (de)intercalation and stable structural evolution of graphite anode in high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries at a low temperature of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Near&#8208;Stoichiometric and Homogenized Perovskite Films for Solar Cells with Minimized Performance Variation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delaying initialized crystallization and manipulating crystal growth of mixed&#8208;cation alloyed perovskites by pre&#8208;seeding colloidal chemistry realized reproducible fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with homogenized chemical compositions and improved optoelectronic properties, delivering a record efficiency up to 24.31&#8201;% for blade&#8208;coated solar cells with minimized performance variation and extended lifespan.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;cation, small band&#8208;gap perovskites via rationally alloying formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA) together have been widely employed for blade&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells with satisfied efficiencies. One of the stringent challenges lies in difficult control of the nucleation and crystallization kinetics of the perovskites with mixed ingredients. Herein, a pre&#8208;seeding strategy by mixing FAPbI3 solution with pre&#8208;synthesized MAPbI3 microcrystals has been developed to smartly decouple the nucleation and crystallization process. As a result, the time window of initialized crystallization has been greatly extended by 3 folds (i.e. from 5&#8197;s to 20&#8197;s), which enables the formation of uniform and homogeneous alloyed&#8208;FAMA perovskite films with designated stoichiometric ratios. The resultant blade&#8208;coated solar cells achieved a champion efficiency of 24.31&#8201;% accompanied by outstanding reproducibility with more than 87&#8201;% of the devices showing efficiencies higher than 23&#8201;%.

         <title>Targeted Protein Upregulation of STING for Boosting the Efficacy of Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we demonstrated that targeted protein upregulation of STING potentiates immunotherapy agents. Using a luminescence&#8208;based cellular assay, we discovered a novel protein&#8208;protein interaction modulator, SB24011, that inhibited the STING&#8208;TRIM29 E3 ligase interaction and upregulated cellular STING levels. As a result, SB24011 boosted STING immunity and improved the in vivo efficacy of immunotherapy with a STING agonist and an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody.







Abstract
Modulating target proteins via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system has recently expanded the scope of pharmacological inventions. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an auspicious target for immunotherapy. Seminal studies envisioned the importance of STING as well as the utility of its agonists in immunotherapy outcomes. Herein, we suggest UPPRIS (upregulation of target proteins by protein&#8208;protein interaction strategy) to pharmacologically increase cellular STING levels for improved immunotherapy. We discovered the small molecule SB24011 that inhibits STING&#8208;TRIM29 E3 ligase interaction, thus blocking TRIM29&#8208;induced degradation of STING. SB24011 enhanced STING immunity by upregulating STING protein levels, which robustly potentiated the immunotherapy efficacy of STING agonist and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody via systemic anticancer immunity. Overall, we demonstrated that targeted protein upregulation of STING can be a promising approach for immuno&#8208;oncology.

         <title>Divergent Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Voacafricines A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented 8&#8208;alkyl octahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;5,8&#8208;methanofuro[2,3&#8208;b]azepin&#8208;8&#8208;ium motif was generated by intramolecular nucleophilic addition of the tertiary amine nitrogen atom to the oxonium generated in situ from a hemiacetal. A squaramide&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction of an &#945;&#8208;ketoester was used to control the C1 configuration of the 1,1&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboline.







Abstract
A divergent asymmetric total synthesis of voacafricines A and B, hexacyclic monoterpene indole alkaloids, has been accomplished featuring the following key steps: a)&#8197;a catalyst&#8208;controlled asymmetric Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction of 6&#8208;methoxytryptamine with a chiral &#945;&#8208;ketoester affording a 1,1&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboline in excellent yield and diastereoselectivity; b)&#8197;oxidative cleavage of a 3,5&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentene furnishing a dialdehyde intermediate, which was effectively differentiated through spontaneous cyclization with the neighboring hydroxy and secondary amine functions; c)&#8197;intramolecular nucleophilic addition of a tertiary amino nitrogen atom to the in situ generated oxonium species generating stereoselectively an unprecedented 8&#8208;alkyl octahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;5,8&#8208;methanofuro[2,3&#8208;b]azepin&#8208;8&#8208;ium motif bearing five contiguous stereocenters. The synthesis confirmed the absolute configuration of these two natural products.

         <title>A Double&#8208;Walled Tetrahedron with AgI4 Vertices Binds Different Guests in Distinct Sites
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically precise [Ag4X]3+ (X=I, Br, or Cl) clusters have been incorporated at the vertices of a double&#8208;walled tetrahedron. The cage binds guests in two distinct modes: small aromatic guests bind externally, and anionic guests bind in the central cavity. Halide ions bound to the silver clusters were observed to exchange in a well&#8208;defined hierarchy, with a preference found for the softer halides.







Abstract
A double&#8208;walled tetrahedral metal&#8208;organic cage assembled in solution from silver(I), 2&#8208;formyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine, halide, and a threefold&#8208;symmetric triamine. The AgI4X clusters at its vertices each bring together six naphthyridine&#8208;imine moieties, leading to a structure in which eight tritopic ligands bridge four clusters in an (AgI4X)4L8 arrangement. Four ligands form an inner set of tetrahedron walls that are surrounded by the outer four. The cage has significant interior volume, and was observed to bind anionic guests. The structure also possesses external binding clefts, located at the edges of the cage, which bound small aromatic guests. Halide ions bound to the silver clusters were observed to exchange in a well&#8208;defined hierarchy, allowing modulation of the cavity volume. The principles uncovered here may allow for increasingly more sophisticated cages with silver&#8208;cluster vertex architectures, with post&#8208;assembly tuning of the interior cavity volume enabling targeted binding behavior.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State THz Vibrations in Aggregates of PtII Complexes Contribute to the Enhancement of Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Efficiencies
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of aggregate PtII complexes exhibits low&#8208;frequency (THz) excited&#8208;state vibrations measured by femtosecond&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy and transient grating photoluminescence spectroscopy. These significant low&#8208;frequency vibronic displacements suppress non&#8208;radiative decay and enhance near&#8208;infrared emission efficiencies.







Abstract
The exploration of deactivation mechanisms for near&#8208;infrared(NIR)&#8208;emissive organic molecules has been a key issue in chemistry, materials science and molecular biology. In this study, based on transient absorption spectroscopy and transient grating photoluminescence spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the aggregated PtII complex 4H (efficient NIR emitter) exhibits collective out&#8208;of&#8208;plane motions with a frequency of 32&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (0.96&#8197;THz) in the excited states. Importantly, similar THz characteristics were also observed in analogous PtII complexes with prominent NIR emission efficiency. The conservation of THz motions enables excited&#8208;state deactivation to proceed along low&#8208;frequency vibrational coordinates, contributing to the suppression of nonradiative decay and remarkable NIR emission. These novel results highlight the significance of excited&#8208;state vibrations in nonradiative processes, which serve as a benchmark for improving device performance.

         <title>Hydride&#8208;containing 2&#8208;Electron Pd/Cu Superatoms as Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acid treatment in PdH2Cu14 leads to the transformation of a bicapped icosahedral Cu14 core into an uncomplete Cu11 (in PdHCu11) and a Cu12 (in PdHCu12) cuboctahedron, both of which are 2e superatoms. Electrochemical HER experiments indicate while PdHCu11, PdHCu12, and PdH2Cu14 are active catalysts, the stability and efficiency of PdHCu11 is much higher than those of PdHCu12 and PdH2Cu14.







Abstract
The first hydride&#8208;containing 2&#8208;electron palladium/copper alloys, [PdHCu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)4] (PdHCu11) and [PdHCu12{S2P(OiPr)2}5{S2PO(OiPr)} (C&#8801;CPh)4] (PdHCu12), are synthesized from the reaction of [PdH2Cu14{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)6] (PdH2Cu14) with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the PdHCu11 and PdHCu12 kernels consist of a central PdH unit encapsulated within a vertex&#8208;missing Cu11 cuboctahedron and complete Cu12 cuboctahedron, respectively. DFT calculations indicate that both PdHCu11 and PdHCu12 can be considered as axially&#8208;distorted 2&#8208;electron superatoms. PdHCu11 shows excellent HER activity, unprecedented within metal nanoclusters, with an onset potential of &#8722;0.05&#8197;V (at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a Tafel slope of 40&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and consistent HER activity during 1000&#8197;cycles in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4. Our study suggests that the accessible central Pd site is the key to HER activity and may provide guidelines for correlating catalyst structures and HER activity.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Switchable Selective Oxidations of Styrene Over Covalent Triazine Frameworks in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent triazine frameworks were designed as metal&#8208;free and recyclable photocatalysts for visible light&#8208;driven switchable selective styrene oxidation into benzaldehyde or styrene oxide. As reported by Kai&#8197;A.&#8197;I. Zhang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202216159), the product formation selectivity was achieved by activation or deactivation of the specific photogenerated oxygen species in pure water.

         <title>Ruthenium/TiO2&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenolysis of Polyethylene Terephthalate: Reaction Pathways Dominated by Coordination Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrogenolysis can produce benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX), where the selectivity control is challenging. Here, we report a &#8220;Ru coordination environment&#8221; dictated reaction pathway by examining adsorbates binding geometries on differently coordinated Ru and their evolution during PET hydrogenolysis. A BTX yield of 77% was obtained using a Ru/TiO2 with a Ru coordination number of ~5.0 where edge/corner sites are dominant, while more gas and saturated products were formed for Ru/TiO2 mainly containing terrace sites. Density function theory and isotopic labelling revealed that under&#8208;coordinated Ru edge sites favor &#8220;upright&#8221; adsorption of aromatic adsorbates while well&#8208;coordinated Ru sites favor &#8220;flat&#8208;lying&#8221; one, where the former mitigates ring hydrogenation and opening. This study demonstrates reaction pathways can be directed through controlled reactant/intermediate binding via tuning &#8220;Ru coordination environment&#8221; for efficient conversion of PET to BTX.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes actuate catalysis through a combination of transition state stabilization and ground state destabilization, inducing enantioselectivity through chiral binding sites. Here, we present a supramolecular model system which employs these basic principles to catalyze the enantiomerization of [5]helicene. Catalysis is hereby mediated not through a network of functional groups but through &#960;&#8722;&#960; catalysis exerted from the curved aromatic framework of a chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) cyclophane offering a binding pocket that is intricately complementary with the enantiomerization transition&#8208;state structure. Although transition state stabilization originates simply from dispersion and electrostatic interactions, enantiomerization kinetics are accelerated by a factor of ~700 at 295 K. Comparison with the meso&#8208;congener of the catalytically active cyclophane shows that upon configurational inversion in only one PBI moiety the catalytic effect is lost, highlighting the importance of precise transition&#8208;state structure recognition in supramolecular enzyme mimics.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR Light&#8208;Mediated Mitochondrial RNA Modification for Cancer RNA Interference Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) plays a critical role in synthesis of mitochondrial proteins. Interfering mtRNA is a highly effective way to induce cell apoptosis. Herein, we report a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated mitochondrial RNA modification approach for long&#8208;term imaging and effective suppression of tumors. A tumor&#8208;targetable NIR fluorescent probe f&#8208;CRI consisting of a cyclic RGD peptide, a NIR fluorophore IR780, and a singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;labile furan group for RNA modification was rationally designed and synthesized. This probe was demonstrated to dominantly accumulate in cellular mitochondria and could be covalently conjugated onto mtRNA upon 808 nm irradiation resulting in prolonged retention in tumors. More notably, thie covalent modification of mtRNA by f&#8208;CRI could perturb the function of mitochondria leading to remarkable tumor suppression. We thus envision that our current approach would offer a potential approach for cancer RNA interference therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hydrazine&#8208;Nitrate Flow Battery Catalyzed by a Bimetallic RuCo Precatalyst for Wastewater Purification along with Simultaneous Generation of Ammonia and Electricity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The traditional technologies for industrial and agricultural effluent treatment are often energy&#8208;intensive. Herein, we suggest an electrochemical redox strategy for spontaneous and simultaneous decontamination of wastewater and generation of both fuels and electricity at low cost. Using hydrazine and nitrate effluents as a demonstration, we propose a hydrazine&#8208;nitrate flow battery (HNFB) that can efficiently purify the wastewater and meanwhile generate both ammonia fuel and electricity with the assistance of our developed bimetallic RuCo precatalyst. Specifically, the battery delivers a peak power density of 12 mW cm&#8208;2 and continuously operates for 20 h with an ammonia yield rate of ca. 0.38 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 under 100 mA cm&#8208;2. The generated electricity can drive a hydrazine electrolyzer to produce hydrogen fuel. Our work provides an alternative pathway to purify wastewater and generate high value&#8208;added fuels at low cost.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Development of Sn(II), Sb(III)&#8208;based Birefringent Material: Crystal Chemistry and Investigation of Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of Sn(II) or Sb(III) with &#960;, non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated units has produced some birefringent crystals with birefringence ranging from 0.005 to 0.468@1064 nm. And it is proven that introducing Sn(II) or Sb(III) into crystals is a feasible strategy to enlarge the birefringence, which not only promotes the miniaturization of fabricated devices, but also effectively modulates polarized light. Herein, recently discovered Sn(II), Sb(III)&#8208;based birefringent crystals with birefringence investigated are summarized, including their crystal structure, and optical properties, especially birefringence. This review also presents the influence of Sn(II), Sb(III) with stereochemical activity lone pair on the optical anisotropy. We hope that this work will acquire a clear perspective on the crystal chemistry of Sn(II), Sb(III)&#8208;based optical functional crystal and promote the development of new birefringent crystal with large optical anisotropy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Spectroscopic Study on Nitrogen Electrooxidation to Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a potential substitute technique for conventional nitrate production, electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) is gaining more and more attention. But, the pathway of this reaction is still unknown owing to the lack of understanding on key reaction intermediates. Herein, electrochemical in situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and isotope&#8208;labeled online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) are employed to study the NOR mechanism over a Rh catalyst. Based on the detected asymmetric NO2&#8208; bending, NO3&#8208; vibration, N=O stretching, and N&#8208;N stretching as well as isotope&#8208;labeled mass signals of N2O and NO, it can be deduced that the NOR undergoes an associative mechanism (distal approach) and the strong N&#8801;N bond in N2 prefers to break concurrently with the hydroxyl addition in distal N.</dc:description>

         <title>Influencing Factors on Li&#8208;ion Conductivity and Interfacial Stability of Solid Polymer Electrolytes, Exampled by Polycarbonates, Polyoxalates and Polymalonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three families of ester&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes consisting of polycarbonate, polyoxalate and polymalonate were prepared and investigated on their Li+&#8208;conductivity and antioxidation ability. The performances of solid polymer electrolytes are affected by the coordinating capability with Li+, molecular asymmetry and existing modes of elemental F.







Abstract
The application of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state(ASS) batteries is hindered by lower Li+&#8208;conductivity and narrower electrochemical window. Here, three families of ester&#8208;based F&#8208;modified SPEs of poly&#8208;carbonate (PCE), poly&#8208;oxalate (POE) and poly&#8208;malonate (PME) were investigated. The Li+&#8208;conductivity of these SPEs prepared from pentanediol are all higher than the counterparts made of butanediol, owing to the enhanced asymmetry and flexibility. Because of stronger chelating coordination with Li+, the Li+&#8208;conductivity of PME and POE is around 10 and 5&#8197;times of PCE. The trifluoroacetyl&#8208;units are observed more effective than &#8722;O&#8722;CH2&#8722;CF2&#8722;CF2&#8722;CH2&#8722;O&#8722; during the in situ passivation of Li&#8208;metal. Using trifluoroacetyl terminated POE and PCE as SPE, the interfaces with Li&#8208;metal and high&#8208;voltage&#8208;cathode are stabilized simultaneously, endowing stable cycling of ASS Li/LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cells. Owing to an enol isomerization of malonate, the cycling stability of Li/PME/NCM622 is deteriorated, which is recovered with the introduce of dimethyl&#8208;group in malonate and the suppression of enol isomerization. The coordinating capability with Li+, molecular asymmetry and existing modes of elemental F, are all critical for the molecular design of SPEs.

&lt;p&gt;Three families of ester-based solid polymer electrolytes consisting of polycarbonate, polyoxalate and polymalonate were prepared and investigated on their Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-conductivity and antioxidation ability. The performances of solid polymer electrolytes are affected by the coordinating capability with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, molecular asymmetry and existing modes of elemental F.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) in all-solid-state(ASS) batteries is hindered by lower Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-conductivity and narrower electrochemical window. Here, three families of ester-based F-modified SPEs of poly-carbonate (PCE), poly-oxalate (POE) and poly-malonate (PME) were investigated. The Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-conductivity of these SPEs prepared from pentanediol are all higher than the counterparts made of butanediol, owing to the enhanced asymmetry and flexibility. Because of stronger chelating coordination with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-conductivity of PME and POE is around 10 and 5&#8197;times of PCE. The trifluoroacetyl-units are observed more effective than &#8722;O&#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;O&#8722; during the in situ passivation of Li-metal. Using trifluoroacetyl terminated POE and PCE as SPE, the interfaces with Li-metal and high-voltage-cathode are stabilized simultaneously, endowing stable cycling of ASS Li/LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM622) cells.

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Design of Chain&#8208;Growth Click Polymerization Based on a Thiol&#8208;Michael Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of chain&#8208;growth click polymerization has been developed that can proceed quickly under ambient conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest the Michael addition controls the kinetics of the propagation process. In addition, this new polymerization can be spatiotemporally regulated by ultraviolet light, and the resulting polymers can be directly used for polymer ligations.







Abstract
The development of chain&#8208;growth click polymerization is challenging yet desirable in modern polymer chemistry. In this work, we reported a novel chain&#8208;growth click polymerization based on the thiol&#8208;Michael reaction. This polymerization could be performed efficiently under ambient conditions and spatiotemporally regulated by ultraviolet light, allowing the synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers in excellent yields and high molecular weights. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the thiolate addition to the Michael acceptor is the rate&#8208;determining step, and introducing the phenyl group could facilitate the chain&#8208;growth process. This polymerization is a new type of chain&#8208;growth click polymerization, which will provide a unique approach to creating functional polymers.

         <title>Atomic Structural Origin of Fictive Temperature Revealed by AZnP3O9 (A=K, Rb) Glasses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new evaluation method is provided to judge the glass stability and glass&#8208;forming ability. As an example, the reported novel glass KZnP3O9 exhibits the highest &#948; (&#948;=1, nglass=8) that quantitatively identifies the short&#8208;range order similarity to its crystalline counterpart. The inverse &#948;&#8208;Tf correlation gives the direct evidence for the structural origin of fictive temperature revealing the relaxation thermodynamics.







Abstract
The fictive temperature (Tf) is widely applied to understand the relaxation thermodynamics of a glass; however, its atomic structural origin is still unclear. Here, we report two novel AZnP3O9 glasses obtained by melting the composition identical single crystals. These glasses exhibit structural inheritance within 5&#8197;&#197; from the single crystal counterparts that is quantified by &#948;=nglass/ncry (0&#8804;&#948;&#8804;1, n is the number of pair correlation functions). Among the available glass&#8208;formers, glassKZnP3O9 exhibits the highest structural inheritance (&#948;=1, nglass=8). More insightfully, a reverse correlation between &#948; and the relaxation thermodynamic parameters is observed in glassAZnP3O9, revealing for the first time the atomic structural origin of fictive temperature.

         <title>Ring Expansion Strategies for the Synthesis of Medium Sized Ring and Macrocyclic Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two ring expansion strategies are reported for the synthesis of medium sized and macrocyclic sulfonamides. Both methods proceed without using classical protecting groups, initiated by nitro reduction and amine conjugate addition respectively, to make diversely functionalised cyclic sulfonamides in a range of ring sizes. The ring size dependency of the synthetic reactions is in good agreement with the outcomes modelled by Density Functional Theory.







Abstract
Two new ring expansion strategies are reported for the synthesis of medium sized ring and macrocyclic sulfonamides. Both methods can be performed without using classical protecting groups, with the key ring expansion step initiated by nitro reduction and amine conjugate addition respectively. Each method can be used to make diversely functionalised cyclic sulfonamides in good to excellent yields, in a range of ring sizes. The ring size dependency of the synthetic reactions is in good agreement with the outcomes modelled by Density Functional Theory calculations.

         <title>Fluorescent Probes Based on AIEgen&#8208;Mediated Polyelectrolyte Assemblies for Manipulating Intramolecular Motion and Magnetic Relaxivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we break the bottleneck of uncontrollable inner microenvironment from the hydrophobicity&#8208;driven assembling strategy, and present a fluorescent probe based AIEgen&#8208;mediated polyelectrolyte nanoassemblies (APN) strategy. By modulating a &#8220;soft&#8221; and water&#8208;rich inner microenvironment in nanotheranostics, APN strategy has for the first time synergistically manipulated both intramolecular motion and magnetic relaxivity.







Abstract
Uniting photothermal therapy (PTT) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) holds great potential in nanotheranostics. However, the extensively utilized hydrophobicity&#8208;driven assembling strategy not only restricts the intramolecular motion&#8208;induced PTT, but also blocks the interactions between MR agents and water. Herein, we report an aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;mediated polyelectrolyte nanoassemblies (APN) strategy, which bestows a unique &#8220;soft&#8221; inner microenvironment with good water permeability. Femtosecond transient spectra verify that APN well activates intramolecular motion from the twisted intramolecular charge transfer process. This de novo APN strategy uniting synergistically three factors (rotational motion, local motion, and hydration number) brings out high MR relaxivity. For the first time, APN strategy has successfully modulated both intramolecular motion and magnetic relaxivity, achieving fluorescence lifetime imaging of tumor spheroids and spatio&#8208;temporal MRI&#8208;guided high&#8208;efficient PTT.

         <title>Pore&#8208;Environment&#8208;Dependent Photoresponsive Oxidase&#8208;Like Activity in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>

Structurally explicit hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) were used to mimic photo&#8208;responsive oxidase. It is shown by constructing isostructural HOFs that the pore environments play an important role in mediating the oxidase&#8208;like activity. The enzyme&#8208;like activity of the HOFs is associated with the substrate&#8208;pore interaction, reminiscent of the binding effect of the native enzyme pocket.







Abstract
Mimicking the bioactivity of native enzymes through synthetic chemistry is an efficient means to advance the biocatalysts in a cell&#8208;free environment, however, remains long&#8208;standing challenges. Herein, we utilize structurally explicit hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) to mimic photo&#8208;responsive oxidase, and uncover the important role of pore environments on mediating oxidase&#8208;like activity by means of constructing isostructural HOFs. We discover that the HOF pore with suitable geometry can stabilize and spatially organize the catalytic substrate into a favorable catalytic route, as with the function of the native enzyme pocket. Based on the desirable photo&#8208;responsive oxidase&#8208;like activity, a visual and sensitive HOFs biosensor is established for the detection of phosphatase, an important biomarker of skeletal and hepatobiliary diseases. This work demonstrates that the pore environments significantly influence the nanozymes&#8217; activity in addition to the active center.

         <title>Total Biosynthesis of Mutaxanthene Unveils a Flavoprotein Monooxygenase Catalyzing Xanthene Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel aromatic polyketide containing a xanthene framework and belonging to the mutaxanthene family was discovered through genome mining. The total biosynthesis of this natural product was successfully accomplished using 14 reconstituted enzymes, revealing that a flavoprotein monooxygenase catalyzes a key ring rearrangement and generates the required xanthene ring through a multistep transformation.







Abstract
Flavoprotein monooxygenases (FPMOs) play important roles in generating structural complexity and diversity in natural products biosynthesized by type&#8197;II polyketide synthases (PKSs). In this study, we used genome mining to discover novel mutaxanthene analogues and investigated the biosynthesis of these aromatic polyketides and their unusual xanthene framework. We determined the complete biosynthetic pathway of mutaxathene through in vivo gene deletion and in vitro biochemical experiments. We show that a multifunctional FPMO, MtxO4, catalyzes ring rearrangement and generates the required xanthene ring through a multistep transformation. In addition, we successfully obtained all necessary enzymes for in vitro reconstitution and completed the total biosynthesis of mutaxanthene in a stepwise manner. Our results revealed the formation of a rare xanthene ring in type&#8197;II polyketide biosynthesis, and demonstrate the potential of using total biosynthesis for the discovery of natural products synthesized by type&#8197;II PKSs.

         <title>Engineering a Copper Single&#8208;Atom Electron Bridge to Achieve Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper single&#8208;atom electron bridges (SAEB) were constructed at the contact interface between Cu1/MoS2 and MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2 to achieve a highly active and stable catalyst for CO2 photoreduction. Empowered by the N&#8722;Cu1&#8722;S SAEB species, the Z&#8208;Scheme charge&#8208;transfer process was significantly promoted, leading to enhancement of the photocatalytic CO2RR.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient and stable photocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) remains a great challenge. We designed a Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalyst with N&#8722;Cu1&#8722;S single&#8208;atom electron bridge (denoted as Cu&#8208;SAEB), which was used to mediate the CO2RR. The production of CO and O2 over Cu&#8208;SAEB is as high as 236.0 and 120.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in the absence of sacrificial agents, respectively, outperforming most previously reported photocatalysts. Notably, the as&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;SAEB is highly stable throughout 30 reaction cycles, totaling 300&#8197;h, owing to the strengthened contact interface of Cu&#8208;SAEB, and mediated by the N&#8722;Cu1&#8722;S atomic structure. Experimental and theoretical calculations indicated that the SAEB greatly promoted the Z&#8208;scheme interfacial charge&#8208;transport process, thus leading to great enhancement of the photocatalytic CO2RR of Cu&#8208;SAEB. This work represents a promising platform for the development of highly efficient and stable photocatalysts that have potential in CO2 conversion applications.

         <title>A Compound I Mimic Reveals the Transient Active Species of a Cytochrome P450 Enzyme: Insight into the Stereoselectivity of P450&#8208;Catalysed Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Obtaining snapshots of cytochrome P450s with their substrates in catalytically relevant poses has been a longstanding challenge. By exploiting the properties of a synthetic porphyrin that closely mimics the highly unstable P450 active species, styrene could be captured in poses that align with the experimental evidence. This approach shows great promise as a tool in the targeted design of more efficient P450 biocatalysts.







Abstract
Catching the structure of cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzymes in flagrante is crucial for the development of P450 biocatalysts, as most structures collected are found trapped in a precatalytic conformation. At the heart of P450 catalysis lies Cpd&#8201;I, a short&#8208;lived, highly reactive intermediate, whose recalcitrant nature has thwarted most attempts at capturing catalytically relevant poses of P450s. We report the crystal structure of P450BM3 mimicking the state in the precise moment preceding epoxidation, which is in perfect agreement with the experimentally observed stereoselectivity. This structure was attained by incorporation of the stable Cpd&#8201;I mimic oxomolybdenum mesoporphyrin IX into P450BM3 in the presence of styrene. The orientation of styrene to the Mo&#8208;oxo species in the crystal structures sheds light onto the dynamics involved in the rotation of styrene to present its vinyl group to Cpd&#8201;I. This method serves as a powerful tool for predicting and modelling the stereoselectivity of P450 reactions.

         <title>Triggered Functional Dynamics of AsLOV2 by Time&#8208;Resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance at High Magnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>

We took advantage of site&#8208;directed spin labeling of Gd&#8208;sTPATCN to track qualitative mechanical movement in the protein AsLOV2. Experiments were done in vitro at room temperature, allowing us to elucidate mutation&#8208;induced inhibited refolding of the J&#945;&#8208;helix.







Abstract
We present time&#8208;resolved Gd&#8722;Gd electron paramagnetic resonance (TiGGER) at 240&#8197;GHz for tracking inter&#8208;residue distances during a protein's mechanical cycle in the solution state. TiGGER makes use of Gd&#8208;sTPATCN spin labels, whose favorable qualities include a spin&#8208;7/2 EPR&#8208;active center, short linker, narrow intrinsic linewidth, and virtually no anisotropy at high fields (8.6&#8197;T) when compared to nitroxide spin labels. Using TiGGER, we determined that upon light activation, the C&#8208;terminus and N&#8208;terminus of AsLOV2 separate in less than 1&#8197;s and relax back to equilibrium with a time constant of approximately 60&#8197;s. TiGGER revealed that the light&#8208;activated long&#8208;range mechanical motion is slowed in the Q513A variant of AsLOV2 and is correlated to the similarly slowed relaxation of the optically excited chromophore as described in recent literature. TiGGER has the potential to valuably complement existing methods for the study of triggered functional dynamics in proteins.

&lt;p&gt;We present time-resolved Gd&#8722;Gd electron paramagnetic resonance (TiGGER) at 240&#8197;GHz for tracking inter-residue distances during a protein's mechanical cycle in the solution state. TiGGER makes use of Gd-sTPATCN spin labels, whose favorable qualities include a spin-7/2 EPR-active center, short linker, narrow intrinsic linewidth, and virtually no anisotropy at high fields (8.6&#8197;T) when compared to nitroxide spin labels. Using TiGGER, we determined that upon light activation, the C-terminus and N-terminus of AsLOV2 separate in less than 1&#8197;s and relax back to equilibrium with a time constant of approximately 60&#8197;s. TiGGER revealed that the light-activated long-range mechanical motion is slowed in the Q513A variant of AsLOV2 and is correlated to the similarly slowed relaxation of the optically excited chromophore as described in recent literature. TiGGER has the potential to valuably complement existing methods for the study of triggered functional dynamics in proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bending Actuation of Hydrogels through Rotation of Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of light&#8208;driven rotary motors in polymer networks leads to active hydrogels that can be engineered as macroscopic bending actuators. In this configuration, lifting experiments reveal that a single molecular motor can pick up loads of 200 times its own molecular weight.







Abstract
The unidirectional rotation of chemically crosslinked light&#8208;driven molecular motors is shown to progressively shift the swelling equilibrium of hydrogels. The concentration of molecular motors and the initial strand density of the polymer network are key parameters to modulate the macroscopic contraction of the material, and both parameters can be tuned using polymer chains of different molecular weights. These findings led to the design of optimized hydrogels revealing a half&#8208;time contraction of approximately 5&#8197;min. Furthermore, under inhomogeneous stimulation, the local contraction event was exploited to design useful bending actuators with an energy output 400 times higher than for previously reported self&#8208;assembled systems involving rotary motors. In the present configuration, we measure that a single molecular motor can lift up loads of 200 times its own molecular weight.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Formal Double C&#8722;H Oxidation of Prenylated Molecules to Alkylidene Oxetanes and Azetidines by Strain&#8208;Enabled Cross&#8208;Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant, mild, formal double C&#8722;H oxidation protocol has been developed that can be used for the selective late&#8208;stage derivatization of prenylated compounds and natural products. This exocyclic&#8208;strain&#8208;driven cross&#8208;metathesis protocol allows the efficient coupling of highly substituted and electron&#8208;rich olefins.







Abstract
Prenylation is a ubiquitous late&#8208;stage modification in nature that often confers significantly improved bioactivity for secondary metabolites. While this lipophilic modification renders enhanced potency, the lipophilic tag(s) can diminish bioavailability and adversely alter drug transportation and metabolism. Thus, a functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant, mild, and selective late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization of prenyl tags would present a great potential in drug discovery programs but could also impact other fields, such as agrochemistry and chemical biology. Herein we report an exocyclic&#8208;strain&#8208;driven cross&#8208;metathesis reaction of prenyl tags, a formal double C&#8722;H oxidation protocol, that can be used for the selective late&#8208;stage derivatization of prenylated compounds and natural products. This methodology avoids the need for prefunctionalization of target molecules and affords ready access to an unprecedented library of oxo&#8208; and aza&#8208;prenylated complex molecules. Thus, in a broader context, this methodology extends late&#8208;stage functionalization beyond that available to nature.

         <title>Xanthene&#8208;Based Nitric Oxide&#8208;Responsive Nanosensor for Photoacoustic Imaging in the SWIR Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A panel of new SWIR dyes based on the xanthene core was synthesized using C&#8722;H activation chemistry. We showcased the biomedical utility of these imaging agents by selecting one example for the development of a ratiometric nanosensor, which we employed to detect elevated levels of nitric oxide in a murine model of drug&#8208;induced liver injury via SWIR PA imaging.







Abstract
Shortwave infrared (SWIR) dyes are characterized by their ability to absorb light from 900 to 1400&#8197;nm, which is ideal for deep tissue imaging owing to minimized light scattering and interference from endogenous pigments. An approach to access such molecules is to tune the photophysical properties of known near&#8208;infrared dyes. Herein, we report the development of a series of easily accessible (three steps) SWIR xanthene dyes based on a dibenzazepine donor conjugated to thiophene (SCR&#8208;1), thienothiophene (SCR&#8208;2), or bithiophene (SCR&#8208;3). We leverage the fact that SCR&#8208;1 undergoes a bathochromic shift when aggregated for in vivo studies by developing a ratiometric nanoparticle for NO (rNP&#8208;NO), which we employed to successfully visualize pathological levels of nitric oxide in a drug&#8208;induced liver injury model via deep tissue SWIR photoacoustic (PA) imaging. Our work demonstrates how easily this dye series can be utilized as a component in nanosensor designs for imaging studies.

         <title>Dynamic Lone Pair Expression as Chemical Bonding Origin of Giant Phonon Anharmonicity in Thermoelectric InTe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For thermoelectric InTe, we reveal dynamic lone&#8208;pair expression as the chemical&#8208;bonding origin of giant phonon anharmonicity and intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity. Our study provides a first detailed microscopic picture connecting dynamical chemical bonding with giant phonon anharmonicity and ultralow thermal conductivity.







Abstract
Loosely bonded (&#8220;rattling&#8221;) atoms with s2 lone pair electrons are usually associated with strong anharmonicity and unexpectedly low thermal conductivity, yet their detailed correlation remains largely unknown. Here we resolve this correlation in thermoelectric InTe by combining chemical bonding analysis, inelastic X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering, and first principles phonon calculations. We successfully probe soft low&#8208;lying transverse phonons dominated by large In1+ z&#8208;axis motions, and their giant anharmonicity. We show that the highly anharmonic phonons arise from the dynamic lone pair expression with unstable occupied antibonding states induced by the covalency between delocalized In1+ 5s2 lone pair electrons and Te 5p states. This work pinpoints the microscopic origin of strong anharmonicity driven by rattling atoms with stereochemical lone pair activity, important for designing efficient materials for thermoelectric energy conversion.

         <title>Sterically Hindered and Deconjugative &#945;&#8208;Regioselective Asymmetric Mannich Reaction of Meinwald Rearrangement&#8208;Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sterically hindered and deconjugative &#945;&#8208;regioselective asymmetric Mannich reaction of Meinwald rearrangement&#8208;intermediates was realized by using chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/ ScIII catalysts, offering chiral &#945;&#8208;quaternary allyl aldehydes and alcohols in high efficiency. Experimental and computational studies showed that the steric hindrance of the ligand and the protecting group on the imine are critical factors influencing the &#945;/&#947;&#8208;regioselectivity.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A sterically hindered and deconjugative &#945;-regioselective asymmetric Mannich reaction of Meinwald rearrangement-intermediates was realized by using chiral &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;-dioxide/ Sc&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; catalysts, offering chiral &#945;-quaternary allyl aldehydes and alcohols in high efficiency.

         <title>Structural Determination and Chemical Synthesis of the N&#8208;Glycan from the Hyperthermophilic Archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation, structural determination, and chemical synthesis of an N&#8208;glycan from the hyper&#8208;thermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis are reported. The identified N&#8208;glycan possesses a highly glycosylated myo&#8208;inositol moiety, which is linked to a disaccharide unit through a phosphodiester. Although myo&#8208;inositol is ubiquitous in archaea and eukaryotes, inositol&#8208;containing N&#8208;glycans were unknown until now.







Abstract
Asparagine&#8208;linked protein glycosylations (N&#8208;glycosylations) are one of the most abundant post&#8208;translational modifications and are essential for various biological phenomena. Herein, we describe the isolation, structural determination, and chemical synthesis of the N&#8208;glycan from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis. The N&#8208;glycan from the organism possesses a unique structure including myo&#8208;inositol, which has not been found in previously characterized N&#8208;glycans. In this structure, myo&#8208;inositol is highly glycosylated and linked with a disaccharide unit through a phosphodiester. The straightforward synthesis of this glycan was accomplished through diastereoselective phosphorylation and phosphodiester construction by SN2 coupling. Considering the early divergence of hyperthermophilic organisms in evolution, this study can be expected to open the door to approaching the primitive function of glycan modification at the molecular level.

         <title>Surface Engineering Stabilizes Rhombohedral Sodium Manganese Hexacyanoferrates for High&#8208;Energy Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>

The sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate full&#8208;cell configurations show comparable energy density to that of the well&#8208;known LiFePO4 full cells.







Abstract
The rhombohedral sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) only containing cheap Fe and Mn metals was regarded as a scalable, low&#8208;cost, and high&#8208;energy cathode material for Na&#8208;ion batteries. However, the unexpected Jahn&#8208;teller effect and significant phase transformation would cause Mn dissolution and anisotropic volume change, thus leading to capacity loss and structural instability. Here we report a simple room&#8208;temperature route to construct a magical CoxB skin on the surface of MnHCF. Benefited from the complete coverage and the buffer effect of CoxB layer, the modified MnHCF cathode exhibits suppressed Mn dissolution and reduced intergranular cracks inside particles, thereby demonstrating thousands&#8208;cycle level cycling lifespan. By comparing two key parameters in the real energy world, i.e., cost per kilowatt&#8208;hours and cost per cycle&#8208;life, our developed CoxB coated MnHCF cathode demonstrates more competitive application potential than the benchmarking LiFePO4 for Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Discovery of Norbornene as a Novel Hydrophobic Tag Applied in Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel norbornene&#8208;based hydrophobic tag was developed that expands the clinical potential of targeted protein degradation technologies. The degrader Hyt&#8208;9, which was obtained by connecting an ALK ligand with norbornene, exhibited potent antiproliferative and degradative activities in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, norbornene could be used to degrade EZH2 when tagged with the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat in degrader Hyt&#8208;13.







Abstract
Hydrophobic tagging (HyT) is a potential therapeutic strategy for targeted protein degradation (TPD). Norbornene was discovered as an unprecedented hydrophobic tag in this study and was used to degrade the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion protein by linking it to ALK inhibitors. The most promising degrader, Hyt&#8208;9, potently reduced ALK levels through Hsp70 and the ubiquitin&#8722;proteasome system (UPS) in vitro without compensatory upregulation of ALK. Furthermore, Hyt&#8208;9 exhibited a significant tumor&#8208;inhibiting effect in vivo with moderate oral bioavailability. More importantly, norbornene can also be used to degrade the intractable enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) when tagged with the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat. Thus, the discovery of novel hydrophobic norbornene tags shows promise for the future development of TPD technology.

         <title>A Tetrahedral Bisacridine Donor Enables Fast Radiative Decay in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bisacridine donor enables both quasi&#8208;equatorial and quasi&#8208;axial geometries in TADF emitter, ensuring an efficient reversed intersystem crossing and an enhanced radiative decay, which results in high&#8208;performance OLEDs.







Abstract
Achieving high efficiency and low efficiency roll&#8208;off simultaneously is of great significance for further application of thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters. A balance between radiative decay and reversed intersystem crossing must be carefully established. Herein, we propose a qunolino&#8208;acridine (QAc) donor composing two acridine with both planar (pAc) and bended (bAc) geometries. Combining with triazine, a TADF emitter QAc&#8208;TRZ is assembled. The pAc provides a well interaction with triazine which ensures a decent TADF behavior, while the bAc offers a delocalization of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) which guarantees an enhancement of radiative decay. Remarkably, QAc&#8208;TRZ enables a highly efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.3&#8201;%. More importantly, the efficiencies under 100/1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 stay 36.3&#8201;% and 31.7&#8201;%, respectively, and remain 21.5&#8201;% even under 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

Record ultralarge&#8208;pores (47&#8197;&#197;), low density (0.106&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) three&#8208;dimensional non&#8208;interpenetrated stp net COF, TUS&#8208;64, was obtained by reticulating a 6&#8208;connected triptycene&#8208;based linker with a 4&#8208;connected porphyrin&#8208;based linker. TUS&#8208;64 displayed the significant qualities of a drug delivery vehicle: controlled release kinetics, sustained delivery, and site&#8208;specific targeting.







Abstract
The unique structural characteristics of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) like high surface areas, interconnected pore system and readily accessible active sites render them promising platforms for a wide set of functional applications. Albeit promising, the reticular construction of 3D COFs with large pores is a very demanding task owing to the formation of interpenetrated frameworks. Herein we report the designed synthesis of a 3D non&#8208;interpenetrated stp net COF, namely TUS&#8208;64, with the largest pore size of all 3D COFs (47&#8197;&#197;) and record&#8208;low density (0.106&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) by reticulating a 6&#8208;connected triptycene&#8208;based linker with a 4&#8208;connected porphyrin&#8208;based linker. Characterized with a highly interconnected mesoporous scaffold and good stability, TUS&#8208;64 shows efficient drug loading and controlled release for five different drugs in simulated body fluid environment, demonstrating the competency of TUS&#8208;64 as drug nanocarriers.

         <title>Tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles: Straightforward Access to Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Polyaromatics from s&#8208;Tetrazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The straightforward access to a new class of aza&#8208;polyaromatics is reported starting from fluorinated s&#8208;tetrazine. The tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles display solid&#8208;state &#960;&#8208;stacking, low reduction potential, absorption in the visible range up to the near&#8208;infrared and intense fluorescence, depending on the molecular structure.







Abstract
The straightforward access to a new class of aza&#8208;polyaromatics is reported. Starting from readily available fluorinated s&#8208;tetrazine, a cyclization process with azide leads to the formation of an unprecedented tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazole or a bis&#8208;tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazole (cis and trans conformers). Based on the new nitrogen core, further N&#8208;directed palladium&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H bond functionalization allows the introduction of halides or acetates. The physicochemical properties of these compounds were studied by a joint experimental/theoretical approach. The tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles display solid&#8208;state &#960;&#8208;stacking, low reduction potential, absorption in the visible range up to the near&#8208;infrared, and intense fluorescence, depending on the molecular structure.

         <title>Understanding Synergistic Catalysis on Cu&#8208;Se Dual Atom Sites via Operando X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic oxygen reduction reaction that occurrs on the Cu1&#8208;N4 and Se1&#8208;C3 dual&#8208;hetero&#8208;atom sites is revealed by the operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy under realistic Zn&#8208;air battery conditions, in which OOH*&#8208;(Cu1&#8208;N4) obtains one electron and is further transformed into the O*&#8208;(Se1&#8208;C2) intermediate.







Abstract
The construction and understanding of synergy in well&#8208;defined dual&#8208;atom active sites is an available avenue to promote multistep tandem catalytic reactions. Herein, we construct a dual&#8208;hetero&#8208;atom catalyst that comprises adjacent Cu&#8208;N4 and Se&#8208;C3 active sites for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy coupled with theoretical calculations provide in&#8208;depth insights into this dual&#8208;atom synergy mechanism for ORR under realistic device operation conditions. The heteroatom Se modulator can efficiently polarize the charge distribution around symmetrical Cu&#8208;N4 moieties, and serve as synergistic site to facilitate the second oxygen reduction step simultaneously, in which the key OOH*&#8208;(Cu1&#8208;N4) transforms to O*&#8208;(Se1&#8208;C2) intermediate on the dual&#8208;atom sites. Therefore, this designed catalyst achieves satisfied alkaline ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.905&#8197;V vs. RHE and a maximum power density of 206.5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in Zn&#8208;air battery.

         <title>A Practical and Robust Zwitterionic Cooperative Lewis Acid/Acetate/Benzimidazolium Catalyst for Direct 1,4&#8208;Additions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular cooperation of CuII, coordinated acetate and a benzimidazolium unit in the catalyst periphery allows for unprecedented catalyst productivity and high stereocontrol in direct 1,4&#8208;additions to maleimides and a number of other Michael acceptors. Next to the sophisticated activation principle, the catalyst is readily prepared and has robust reactivity. Moreover, it is shown to be reusable multiple times.







Abstract
A catalyst type is disclosed allowing for exceptional efficiency in direct 1,4&#8208;additions. The catalyst is a zwitterionic entity, in which acetate binds to CuII, which is formally negatively charged and serving as counterion for benzimidazolium. All 3 functionalities are involved in the catalytic activation. For maleimides productivity was increased by a factor &gt;300 compared to literature (TONs up to 6700). High stereoselectivity and productivity was attained for a broad range of other Michael acceptors as well. The polyfunctional catalyst is accessible in only 4 steps from N&#8208;Ph&#8208;benzimidazole with an overall yield of 96&#8201;% and robust during catalysis. This allowed to reuse the same catalyst multiple times with nearly constant efficiency. Mechanistic studies, in particular by DFT, give a detailed picture how the catalyst operates. The benzimidazolium unit stabilizes the coordinated enolate nucleophile and prevents that acetate/acetic acid dissociate from the catalyst.

         <title>Amphoteric Cellulose&#8208;Based Double&#8208;Network Hydrogel Electrolyte Toward Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a flexible amphoteric cellulose&#8208;based double&#8208;network hydrogel electrolyte. The amphoteric groups not only promoted the desolvation process of [Zn(H2O)6]2+ to eliminate side reactions, but also guided the Zn2+ deposition to inhibit dendrite growth, thus resulting in a ultra&#8208;stable Zn anode.







Abstract
Zinc (Zn) metal anode suffers from uncontrollable Zn dendrites and parasitic side reactions at the interface, which restrict the practical application of aqueous rechargeable zinc batteries (ARZBs). Herein, an amphoteric cellulose&#8208;based double&#8208;network is introduced as hydrogel electrolyte to overcome these obstacles. On one hand, the amphoteric groups build anion/cation transport channels to regulate electro&#8208;deposition behavior on Zn (002) crystal plane enabled by homogenizing Zn2+ ions flux. On the other hand, the strong bonding between negatively charged carboxyl groups and Zn2+ ions promote the desolvation process of [Zn(H2O)6]2+ to eliminate side reactions. Based on the above two functions, the hydrogel electrolyte enables an ultra&#8208;stable cycling with a cumulative capacity of 7&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Zn cell. This work provides significant concepts for developing hydrogel electrolytes to realize stable anode for high&#8208;performance ARZBs.

         <title>Dredging the Charge&#8208;Carrier Transfer Pathway for Efficient Low&#8208;Dimensional Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of low&#8208;dimensional Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper perovskites (GABA)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n=1, 2, 3, 4, MA+=CH3NH3+) with inhibited dielectric confinement were constructed with &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) as the spacer cation. The hydrogen bonds&#160;between the spacers link the adjacent spacing sheets, enabling the charges localized in the van der Waals gap. The power conversion efficiency of (GABA)2MA4Pb5I16 solar cells with excellent carrier transport properties is up to 18.73&#8201;%.







Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (LDRP) perovskites still suffer from inferior carrier transport properties. Here, we demonstrate that efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer can be achieved in LDRP perovskite by introducing &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a spacer. The hydrogen bonding links adjacent spacing sheets in (GABA)2MA3Pb4I13 (MA=CH3NH3+), leading to the charges localized in the van der Waals gap, thereby constructing &#8220;charged&#8208;bridge&#8221; for charge transfer through the spacing region. Additionally, the polarized GABA weakens dielectric confinement, decreasing the (GABA)2MA3Pb4I13 exciton binding energy as low as &#8776;73&#8197;meV. Benefiting from these merits, the resultant GABA&#8208;based solar cell yields a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.73&#8201;% with enhanced carrier transport properties. Furthermore, the unencapsulated device maintains 92.8&#8201;% of its initial PCE under continuous illumination after 1000&#8197;h and only lost 3&#8201;% of its initial PCE under 65&#8201;&#176;C for 500&#8197;h.

         <title>Engineering Cytochrome P450BM3 Enzymes for Direct Nitration of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The peroxidase activity of a dual&#8208;functional small&#8208;molecule (DFSM)&#8208;facilitated P450BM3&#8208;H2O2 system was drastically improved through mechanism&#8208;guided protein engineering for the P450&#8208;mediated direct nitration of phenols, anilines, and styrenes using nitrite as the nitrating agent. Co&#8208;crystal structures revealed the crucial role of the steric effect introduced by site&#8208;directed mutations of proximal residues in the regulation of substrate access.







Abstract
Applications of the peroxidase activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes in synthetic chemistry remain largely unexplored. We present herein a protein engineering strategy to increase cytochrome P450BM3 peroxidase activity for the direct nitration of aromatic compounds and terminal aryl&#8208;substituted olefins in the presence of a dual&#8208;functional small molecule (DFSM). Site&#8208;directed mutations of key active&#8208;site residues allowed the efficient regulation of steric effects to limit substrate access and, thus, a significant decrease in monooxygenation activity and increase in peroxidase activity. Nitration of several phenol and aniline compounds also yielded ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;nitration products with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high total turnover numbers. Besides direct aromatic nitration by P450 variants using nitrite as a nitrating agent, we also demonstrated the use of the DFSM&#8208;facilitated P450 peroxidase system for the nitration of the vinyl group of styrene and its derivatives.

         <title>Visible Helicity Induction and Memory in Polyallene toward Circularly Polarized Luminescence, Helicity Discrimination, and Enantiomer Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of racemic polymers were induced into one&#8208;handed helices which were memorized after the chiral inducer was removed. The enantiomeric excess of one handed helix (eeh) is up to 98&#8201;%. Interestingly, the switchable helix&#8208;induction is visible with the naked eye. Moreover, the one&#8208;handed helices exhibit enhanced stability with helicity discrimination and enantiomer separation abilities.







Abstract
Inspired by biological helices (e.g., DNA), artificial helical polymers have attracted intense attention. However, precise synthesis of one&#8208;handed helices from achiral materials remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a series of achiral poly(biphenyl allene)s with controlled molar mass and low dispersity were prepared and induced into one&#8208;handed helices using chiral amines and alcohols. The induced one&#8208;handed helix was simultaneously memorized, even after the chiral inducer was removed. The switchable induction processes were visible to naked eye; the achiral polymers exhibited blue emission (irradiated at 365&#8197;nm), whereas the induced one&#8208;handed helices exhibited cyan emission with clear circularly polarized luminescence. The induced helices formed stable gels in various solvents with helicity discrimination ability: the same&#8208;handed helix gels were self&#8208;healing, whereas the gels of opposite&#8208;handed helicity were self&#8208;sorted. Moreover, the induced helices could separate enantiomers via enantioselective crystallization with high efficiency and switchable enantioselectivity.

         <title>Simultaneous co&#8208;Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction and Ethanol Oxidation towards Synergistic Acetaldehyde Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoredox system that can simultaneous use photoinduced electrons and holes for solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction coupled with selective ethanol oxidation to one identical value&#8208;added CH3CHO product is realized on Rb and K co&#8208;modified carbon nitride catalyst, with a benchmark C2 product yield and near&#8208;ideal atomic economy.







Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 is of great interest but it often suffers sluggish oxidation half reaction and undesired by&#8208;products. Here, we report for the first the simultaneous co&#8208;photocatalytic CO2 reduction and ethanol oxidation towards one identical value&#8208;added CH3CHO product on a rubidium and potassium co&#8208;modified carbon nitride (CN&#8208;KRb). The CN&#8208;KRb offers a record photocatalytic activity of 1212.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1g&#8722;1 with a high selectivity of 93.3&#8201;% for CH3CHO production, outperforming all the state&#8208;of&#8208;art CO2 photocatalysts. It is disclosed that the introduced Rb boosts the *OHCCHO fromation and facilitates the CH3CHO desorption, while K promotes ethanol adsorption and activation. Moreover, the H+ stemming from ethanol oxidation is confirmed to participate in the CO2 reduction process, endowing near ideal overall atomic economy. This work provides a new strategy for effective use of the photoexcited electron and hole for high selective and sustainable conversion of CO2 paired with oxidation reaction into identical product.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Radical 1,2&#8208;Carbophosphonylation of Styrenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and enantioselective radical 1,2&#8208;carbophosphonylation of styrenes from readily available alkyl halides and dialkyl phosphites is developed. The key to the success of the strategy lies in not only the proper choice of phosphorus reagents to suppress the reverse chemoselectivity but also the utilization of a chiral N,N,N&#8208;ligand to forge chiral C(sp3)&#8722;P bond.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective radical difunctionalization of alkenes from readily available alkyl halides and organophosphorus reagents possessing a P&#8722;H bond provides an appealing approach for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral alkyl phosphorus compounds. The major challenge arises from the easy generation of a P&#8208;centered radical from the P&#8722;H&#8208;type reagent and its facile addition to the terminal side of alkenes, leading to reverse chemoselectivity. We herein disclose a radical 1,2&#8208;carbophosphonylation of styrenes in a highly chemo&#8208; and enantioselective manner. The key to the success lies in not only the implementation of dialkyl phosphites with a strong bond dissociation energy to promote the desired chemoselectivity but also the utilization of an anionic chiral N,N,N&#8208;ligand to forge the chiral C(sp3)&#8722;P bond. The developed Cu/N,N,N&#8208;ligand catalyst has enriched our library of single&#8208;electron transfer catalysts in the enantioselective radical transformations.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Conductive Supramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Superstructures for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic superstructures are designed, which empower high&#8208;kinetics Grotthuss proton conduction to deeply access built&#8208;in protophilic oxygen motifs via a two&#8208;step nine&#8208;electron (de)coordination reaction, endowing the assembled Zn&#8208;organic battery ultrahigh energy density, superior rate capacity and ultra&#8208;stable cyclability.







Abstract
With fast (de)coordination kinetics, the smallest and the lightest proton stands out as the most ideal charge carrier for aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). Hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks with rapid Grotthuss proton conduction is particularly suitable for organic cathodes, yet not reported. We report the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of cyanuric acid and 1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triamine into organic superstructures through in&#8208;plane H&#8208;bonds and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction. The supramolecular superstructures exhibit highly stable lock&#8208;and&#8208;key H&#8208;bonding networks with an ultralow activation energy for protonation (0.09&#8197;eV vs. 0.25&#8197;eV of zincification). Then, high&#8208;kinetics H+ coordination is prior to Zn2+ into protophilic C=O sites via a two&#8208;step nine&#8208;electron reaction. The assembled ZOBs show high&#8208;rate capability (135&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 150&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), high energy density (267&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1cathode) and ultra&#8208;long life (50&#8201;000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), becoming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZOBs in comprehensive performances.

         <title>Plasmonic Cu Nanoparticles for the Low&#8208;temperature Photo&#8208;driven Water&#8208;gas Shift Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
A layered double hydroxide&#8208;derived plasmonic Cu catalyst was synthesized for the photo&#8208;driven water&#8208;gas shift reaction (WGSR). Light&#8208;induced hot electrons led to efficient *H2O activation and *H combination via a carboxyl pathway. High hydrogen production rate (114.35&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) was realized at 200&#8201;&#176;C through the plasmonic Cu&#8208;mediated strategy, representing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance for (photo&#8208;)thermal WGSR catalyst at low temperatures.







Abstract
The activation of water molecules in thermal catalysis typically requires high temperatures, representing an obstacle to catalyst development for the low&#8208;temperature water&#8208;gas shift reaction (WGSR). Plasmonic photocatalysis allows activation of water at low temperatures through the generation of light&#8208;induced hot electrons. Herein, we report a layered double hydroxide&#8208;derived copper catalyst (LD&#8208;Cu) with outstanding performance for the low&#8208;temperature photo&#8208;driven WGSR. LD&#8208;Cu offered a lower activation energy for WGSR to H2 under UV/Vis irradiation (1.4&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) compared to under dark conditions. Detailed experimental studies revealed that highly dispersed Cu nanoparticles created an abundance of hot electrons during light absorption, which promoted *H2O dissociation and *H combination via a carboxyl pathway, leading to the efficient production of H2. Results demonstrate the benefits of exploiting plasmonic phenomena in the development of photo&#8208;driven low&#8208;temperature WGSR catalysts.

         <title>Boosting Electroreduction Kinetics of Nitrogen to Ammonia via Atomically Dispersed Sn Protuberance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric Sn atomically dispersed protuberance (ADP) having a special coordination with substrate C and O atoms was designed. This unique structure could induce positive charge accumulation on Sn site for improving its N2 adsorption, activation and thus the N2 reduction reaction (NRR) performance. As a result, the obtained Sn ADPs displayed an outstanding electrocatalytic activity, high selectivity stability, and durability in the NRR.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal catalysts show potential advantages in N2 reduction reaction (NRR) due to their excellent activity and efficient metal utilization. Unfortunately, the reported catalysts usually exhibit unsatisfactory NRR activity due to their poor N2 adsorption and activation. Herein, we report a novel Sn atomically dispersed protuberance (ADP) by coordination with substrate C and O to induce positive charge accumulation on Sn site for improving its N2 adsorption, activation and NRR performance. The extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra confirmed the local coordination structure of the Sn ADPs. NRR activity was significantly promoted via Sn ADPs, exhibiting a remarkable NH3 yield (RNH3) of 28.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 (7447&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgSn&#8722;1) at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V. Furthermore, the enhanced N2Hx intermediates was verified by in situ experiments, yielding consistent results with DFT calculation. This work opens a new avenue to regulate the activity and selectivity of N2 fixation.

     alt="Boosting Electroreduction Kinetics of Nitrogen to Ammonia via Atomically Dispersed Sn Protuberance"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An asymmetric Sn atomically dispersed protuberance (ADP) having a special coordination with substrate C and O atoms was designed. This unique structure could induce positive charge accumulation on Sn site for improving its N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption, activation and thus the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (NRR) performance. As a result, the obtained Sn ADPs displayed an outstanding electrocatalytic activity, high selectivity stability, and durability in the NRR.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically dispersed metal catalysts show potential advantages in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (NRR) due to their excellent activity and efficient metal utilization. Unfortunately, the reported catalysts usually exhibit unsatisfactory NRR activity due to their poor N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and activation. Herein, we report a novel Sn atomically dispersed protuberance (ADP) by coordination with substrate C and O to induce positive charge accumulation on Sn site for improving its N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption, activation and NRR performance. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra confirmed the local coordination structure of the Sn ADPs. NRR activity was significantly promoted via Sn ADPs, exhibiting a remarkable NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;NH3&lt;/sub&gt;) of 28.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (7447&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;Sn&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V. Furthermore, the enhanced N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates was verified by in situ experiments, yielding consistent results with DFT calculation.

         <title>Directed Asymmetric Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive 1,2&#8208;Diarylation of Electronically Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly diastereoselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive 1,2&#8208;diarylation of unactivated internal alkenes was developed. Additionally, the enantioselective variant with unactivated terminal and challenging internal alkenes was also achieved, delivering various polyarylalkanes bearing benzylic stereocenters with good to high enantioselectivities and excellent diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;diarylation of electronically unactivated alkenes has emerged as an extensive research topic in organic synthesis. However, most examples are mainly limited to terminal alkenes. Furthermore, transition&#8208;metal catalyzed asymmetric 1,2&#8208;diarylation of unactivated alkenes still remains unsolved and is a formidable challenge. Herein, we describe a highly efficient directed nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive 1,2&#8208;diarylation of unactivated internal alkenes with high diastereoselectivities. More importantly, our further effort towards enantioselective 1,2&#8208;diarylation of the unactivated terminal and challenging internal alkenes is achieved, furnishing various polyarylalkanes featuring benzylic stereocenters in high yields and with good to high enantioselectivities and high diastereoselectivities. Interestingly, the generation of cationic Ni&#8208;catalyst by adding alkali metal fluoride is the key to increased efficiency of this enantioselective reaction.

         <title>Chemically Recyclable Polyethylene&#8208;like Sulfur&#8208;Containing Plastics from Sustainable Feedstocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a new family of chemically recyclable polymers in a large scale from the sustainable monomers H2O, COS, and diacrylates. Such resultant polymers manifest impressive toughness and ductility comparable to commodity polyethylene. The chemical recycling of these polymers can be readily achieved through two closed loops.







Abstract
The green revolution in plastics should be accelerated due to growing sustainability concerns. Here, we develop a series of chemically recyclable polymers from the first reported cascade polymerization of H2O, COS, and diacrylates. In addition to abundant feedstocks, the method is efficient and air&#8208;tolerant, uses common organic bases as catalysts, and yields polymers with high molecular weights under mild conditions. Such polymers, structurally like polyethylene with low&#8208;density in&#8208;chain polar groups, manifest impressive toughness and ductility comparable to high&#8208;density polyethylene. The in&#8208;chain ester group acts as a breaking point, enabling these polymers to undergo chemical recycling through two loops. The structures and properties of these polymers also have an immeasurably expanded range owing to the versatility of our method. The readily available raw materials, facile synthesis, and high performance make these polymers promising prospects as sustainable materials in practice.

A globally robust HOF with both rigidity and flexibility was constructed. The non&#8208;crystalline and crystalline phases of the HOF could be easily and reversibly switched at will with the specific solvent molecule. Furthermore, the obtained HOF exhibits excellent separation efficiency for benzene and cyclohexane (94.4&#8201;%).







Abstract
A weak CH/O hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) with both rigidity and flexibility that could easily and reversibly switch from a non&#8208;crystalline to a crystalline phase was constructed. The specific solvent molecule acts as a &#8220;key&#8221; to control the crystallinity, while the highly rigid triangle macrocycle as the building block is the &#8220;lock&#8221;. The introduction and removal of the &#8220;key&#8221; could influence the local flexibility of the whole framework and lead to switchable crystallinity. Furthermore, the obtained HOF exhibits excellent separation efficiency for benzene and cyclohexane (94.4&#8201;%).

         <title>Towards Axially Chiral Pyrazole&#8208;Based Phosphorus Scaffolds by Dipeptide&#8208;Phosphonium Salt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective reaction has been developed for the construction of axially chiral arylpyrazole skeletons with phosphorus unit. The reaction proceeds through a sequential Huisgen&#8208;type cycloaddition/aromatization process with central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion using a dipeptide&#8208;phosphonium salt catalyst. Arylpyrazole&#8208;based atropisomeric phosphorus compounds are obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Given the comparatively lower rotational barriers, the catalytic asymmetric construction of axially chiral biaryl structures, especially those containing a five&#8208;membered heterocycle, still remains a challenge. Herein, we described a general and modular protocol to access atropisomeric arylpyrazole scaffolds containing a phosphorus unit by a dipeptide phosphonium salt catalyzed reaction involving an oxidative central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion. This reaction features excellent yields and enantioselectivities, broad substrate scope, and a low catalyst loading, delivering axially chiral phosphine compounds.

         <title>Alloying&#8208;Triggered Phase Engineering of NiFe System via Laser&#8208;Assisted Al Incorporation for Full Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;standing hybrid system consisting of Ni2Al3 and Ni3Fe phases was constructed by laser&#8208;assisted aluminum incorporation on nickel foam (NF) for full water splitting. Ni18Fe12Al70 (Ni2Al3 and Ni3Fe) delivers an extremely low overpotential to trigger HER and OER processes with better performance than individual Ni60Fe40 (Ni3Fe phase) and individual Ni30Al70 (Ni2Al3 phase), allowing a design strategy of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.







Abstract
It is challenging to design one non&#8208;noble material with balanced bifunctional performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for commercial sustainability at a low cost since the different electrocatalytic mechanisms are not easily matchable for each other. Herein, a self&#8208;standing hybrid system Ni18Fe12Al70, consisting of Ni2Al3 and Ni3Fe phases, was constructed by laser&#8208;assisted aluminum (Al) incorporation towards full water splitting. It was found that the incorporation of Al could effectively tune the morphologies, compositions and phases. The results indicate that Ni18Fe12Al70 delivers an extremely low overpotential to trigger both HER (&#951;100=188&#8197;mV) and OER (&#951;100=345&#8197;mV) processes and maintains a stable overpotential for 100&#8197;h, comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The synergistic effect of Ni2Al3 and Ni3Fe alloys on the HER process is confirmed based on theoretical calculation.

         <title>Chemical Enhancement and Quenching in Single&#8208;Molecule Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We find that the tip&#8208;molecule point contact can dramatically increase the molecular tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) signal via a combined physico&#8208;chemical mechanism induced by the ground&#8208;state charge transfer (GSCT). In contrast, the TERS signal from a planar molecule chemisorbed flatly on the silver substrate is significantly quenched, mainly due to the polarizability screening induced by the interfacial dynamic charge transfer (IDCT).







Abstract
Despite intensive research in surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), the influence mechanism of chemical effects on Raman signals remains elusive. Here, we investigate such chemical effects through tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) of a single planar ZnPc molecule with varying but controlled contact environments. TERS signals are found dramatically enhanced upon making a tip&#8211;molecule point contact. A combined physico&#8208;chemical mechanism is proposed to explain such an enhancement via the generation of a ground&#8208;state charge&#8208;transfer induced vertical Raman polarizability that is further enhanced by the strong vertical plasmonic field in the nanocavity. In contrast, TERS signals from ZnPc chemisorbed flatly on substrates are found strongly quenched, which is rationalized by the Raman polarizability screening effect induced by interfacial dynamic charge transfer. Our results provide deep insights into the understanding of the chemical effects in TERS/SERS enhancement and quenching.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopentadiene and Methylcyclopentadiene with Xylose or Extracted Hemicellulose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly integrated two&#8208;step strategy was developed for the selective synthesis of renewable cyclopentadiene (CPD) and methylcyclopentadiene (MCPD) with xylose or the hemicelluloses extracted from real biomass. Compared with the conventional fossil route, the new synthetic strategy has evident advantages in the renewability and higher availability of feedstock.







Abstract
Cyclopentadiene (CPD) and methylcyclopentadiene (MCPD) are important intermediates that have been widely used in the production of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rocket fuels, polymers and valuable chemicals. Currently, CPD and MCPD are produced from fossil energies at very low yields, which greatly limits their application. As a solution to this problem, we disclose an alternative two&#8208;step bio&#8208;route to access CPD and MCPD using xylose or extracted hemicellulose as the feedstock. In the first step, cyclopentanone (CPO) was directly produced by the selective hydrogenolysis of xylose or extracted hemicellulose over a commercial Ru/C catalyst in an acid&#8208;free toluene/NaCl aqueous solution biphasic system. In the second step, CPO was selectively converted to CPD by a cascade hydrodeoxygenation/dehydrogenation reaction over zinc molybdate catalysts. When methanol was introduced with CPO and hydrogen, MCPD was selectively obtained by a cascade dehydrogenation/aldol condensation/selective hydrodeoxygenation reaction over zinc molybdate catalysts.

         <title>Highly Twisted Conformation Thiopyrylium Photosensitizers for In Vivo Near Infrared&#8208;II Imaging and Rapid Inactivation of Coronavirus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between molecular configuration and charge transfer process in NIR&#8208;II chromophores has been revealed, which informed the engineering of an efficient NIR photosensitizer (PS), SP@HD&#8208;PEG2K. The dramatic improvement of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) quantum yield of the PSs enabled NIR&#8208;II image&#8208;guided in vivo pulmonary coronavirus photoablation for the first time and created a convenient paradigm for the development of NIR heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PSs.







Abstract
Despite significant effort, a majority of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers have short excitation wavelengths, thereby hampering their biomedical applications. Here, we present a facile approach for developing efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers. Based on a series of thiopyrylium&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II (1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) dyads, we found that the star dyad HD with a sterically bulky and electron&#8208;rich moiety exhibited configuration torsion and significantly enhanced intersystem crossing (ISC) compared to the parent dyad. The electron excitation characteristics of HD changed from local excitation (LE) to charge transfer (CT)&#8208;domain, contributing to a &#8776;6&#8208;fold reduction in energy gap (&#916;EST), a &#8776;10&#8208;fold accelerated ISC process, and a &#8776;31.49&#8208;fold elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) quantum yield. The optimized SP@HD&#8208;PEG2K lung&#8208;targeting dots enabled real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II lung imaging, which precisely guided rapid pulmonary coronavirus inactivation.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Independent and Cell&#8208;Free Biosynthesis of &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids Using Vinyl Esters as Smart Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4&#8208;enzyme cell&#8208;free system transforms vinyl esters into &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids in the absence of ATP and ancillary electron donors through concurrent abiotic thiolysis, non&#8208;decarboxylating Claisen condensation, ketone reduction and hydrolysis steps. The same substrate provides the energy to activate the acyl group and the redox power to reduce the condensed ketone.







Abstract
In vitro biosynthetic pathways that condense and reduce molecules through coenzyme A (CoASH) activation demand energy and redox power in the form of ATP and NAD(P)H, respectively. These coenzymes must be orthogonally recycled by ancillary reactions that consume chemicals, electricity, or light, impacting the atom economy and/or the energy consumption of the biosystem. In this work, we have exploited vinyl esters as dual acyl and electron donor substrates to synthesize &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids through a non&#8208;decarboxylating Claisen condensation, reduction and hydrolysis stepwise cascade, including a NADH recycling step, catalyzed by a total of 4 enzymes. Herein, the chemical energy to activate the acyl group with CoASH and the redox power for the reduction are embedded into the vinyl esters. Upon optimization, this self&#8208;sustaining cascade reached a titer of (S)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy butyrate of 24&#8197;mM without requiring ATP and simultaneously recycling CoASH and NADH. This work illustrates the potential of in vitro biocatalysis to transform simple molecules into multi&#8208;functional ones.

This work illustrates the potential of in vitro biocatalysis to transform simple molecules into multi-functional ones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We report an iridium&#8208;catalyzed highly chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective allyl&#8208;allyl coupling between branched allyl alcohols and &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters resulting in enantioenriched (E)&#8208;1&#8208;boryl&#8208;substituted 1,5&#8208;dienes. All four stereoisomers with two adjacent chiral centers were obtained by chirality pairing. Mechanistic studies were conducted to understand the high levels of selectivity.







Abstract
Here, we report a highly chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective allyl&#8208;allyl coupling between branched allyl alcohols and &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters, catalyzed by a chiral iridium complex. The &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters can be chemoselectively coupled with allyl electrophiles, affording a diverse set of enantioenriched (E)&#8208;1&#8208;boryl&#8208;substituted 1,5&#8208;dienes in good yields, with excellent stereoselectivity. By permuting the chiral iridium catalysts and the substrates, we efficiently and selectively obtained all four stereoisomers bearing two consecutive chiral centers. Mechanistic studies via density functional theory calculations revealed the origins of the diastereo&#8208; and chemoselectivities, indicating the pivotal roles of the steric interaction, the &#946;&#8208;silicon effect, and a rapid desilylation process. Additional synthetic modifications for preparing a variety of enantioenriched compounds containing contiguous chiral centers are also included.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;long Near&#8208;infrared Repeatable Photochemical Afterglow Mediated by Reversible Storage of Singlet Oxygen for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated a general strategy to realize repeatable photochemical afterglow (RPA) based on the reversible storage of singlet oxygen. Ultra&#8208;long near&#8208;infrared afterglow was achieved via the singlet oxygen&#8208;sensitized fluorescence approach, and its intensity shows no significant reduction over 50 excitation cycles. The RPA system was further applied for attacker&#8208;misleading information encryption, presenting a repeatable read&#8208;out.







Abstract
Photochemical afterglow systems have drawn considerable attention in recent years due to their regulable photophysical properties and charming application potential. However, conventional photochemical afterglow suffered from its unrepeatability due to the consumption of energy cache units as afterglow photons are emitted. Here we report a novel strategy to realize repeatable photochemical afterglow (RPA) through the reversible storage of 1O2 by 2&#8208;pyridones. Near&#8208;infrared afterglow with a lifetime over 10&#8197;s is achieved, and its initial intensity shows no significant reduction over 50 excitation cycles. A detailed mechanism study was conducted and confirmed the RPA is realized through the singlet oxygen&#8208;sensitized fluorescence emission. Furthermore, the generality of this strategy is demonstrated and tunable afterglow lifetimes and colors are achieved by rational design. The developed RPA is further applied for attacker&#8208;misleading information encryption, presenting a repeatable&#8208;readout.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Molecule&#8208;Regulated Core&#8208;Shell&#8208;Solvation Electrolyte for Li&#8208;Metal Batteries at Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature</title>

         <dc:description>
A new amphiphilic solvent is rationally designed to induce self&#8208;assembly of the electrolyte solution to form a peculiar core&#8208;shell&#8208;solvation structure. Such unique solvation structure bestows improved ionic conductivity, low desolvation energy, and highly robust and conductive SEI, which overcomes the long&#8208;standing Li compatibility and deposition kinetic challenges, enabling the stable operation of Li&#8208;metal battery under ultra&#8208;low temperature.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries hold great promise for promoting energy density and operating at low temperatures, yet they still suffer from insufficient Li compatibility and slow kinetic, especially at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. Herein, we rationally design and synthesize a new amphiphilic solvent, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;3&#8208;methoxypropane, for use in battery electrolytes. The lithiophilic segment is readily to solvate Li+ to induce self&#8208;assembly of the electrolyte solution to form a peculiar core&#8208;shell&#8208;solvation structure. Such unique solvation structure not only largely improves the ionic conductivity to allow fast Li+ transport and lower the desolvation energy to enable facile desolvation, but also leads to the formation of a highly robust and conductive inorganic SEI. The resulting electrolyte demonstrates high Li efficiency and superior cycling stability from room temperature to &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C at high current densities. Meanwhile, anode&#8208;free high&#8208;voltage cell retains 87&#8201;% capacity after 100 cycles.

         <title>Vanadium Oxides with Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Heterointerface Network for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium oxide materials with the unique amorphous&#8208;crystalline heterostructure are fabricated using an electrochemical method for the first time. The electrode displays good electrochemical performances as cathode for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Experimental and simulation results suggest that the amorphous&#8208;crystalline heterostructure exhibits the favourable cation adsorption and ion diffusion properties compared to other modelling structures.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;VOx batteries are attracting attention in large scale energy storage applications. Yet, the sluggish Zn2+ diffusion kinetics and ambiguous structure&#8211;property relationship are always challenging to fulfil the great potential of the batteries. Here we electrodeposit vanadium oxide nanobelts (VO&#8208;E) with highly disordered structure. The electrode achieves high capacities (e.g., &#8776;5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 516&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), good rate and cycling performances. Detailed structure analysis indicates VO&#8208;E is composed of integrated amorphous&#8208;crystalline nanoscale domains, forming an efficient heterointerface network in the bulk electrode, which accounts for the good electrochemical properties. Theoretical calculations indicate that the amorphous&#8208;crystalline heterostructure exhibits the favorable cation adsorption and lower ion diffusion energy barriers compared to the amorphous and crystalline counterparts, thus accelerating charge carrier mobility and electrochemical activity of the electrode.

The electron reduction of diamido&#8208;naphthyl aluminum iodide in benzene produces dialuminyl substituted Birch&#8208;type reduction product. Time dependent EPR experiments in combination with DFT calculations suggest a reaction mechanism where stable AlII radical intermediates play a crucial role for the reaction outcome. The aluminum radical stability is a consequence of a rigid supporting ligand with silyl protective substituents.







Abstract
Electrophilic AlIII species have long dominated the aluminum reactivity towards arenes. Recently, nucleophilic low&#8208;valent AlI aluminyl anions have showcased oxidative additions towards arenes C&#8722;C and/or C&#8722;H bonds. Herein, we communicate compelling evidence of an AlII radical addition reaction to the benzene ring. The electron reduction of a ligand stabilized precursor with KC8 in benzene furnishes a double addition to the benzene ring instead of a C&#8722;H bond activation, producing the corresponding cyclohexa&#8208;1,3(orl,4)&#8208;dienes as Birch&#8208;type reduction product. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, EPR spectroscopy, and DFT results suggest this reactivity proceeds through a stable AlII radical intermediate, whose stability is a consequence of a rigid scaffold in combination with strong steric protection.

         <title>Electrochemical Interfacial Polymerization toward Ultrathin COF Membranes for Brine Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy, which actively manipulates the self&#8208;healing effect and self&#8208;inhibiting effect during electrochemical process, is developed for fabricating ultrathin and robust COF membranes for efficient brine desalination.







Abstract
Ultrathin covalent organic framework (COF) membranes are urgently demanded in molecular/ionic separations. Herein, we reported an electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy to fabricate ultrathin COF membranes with thickness of 85&#8197;nm, by actively manipulate self&#8208;healing effect and self&#8208;inhibiting effect. The resulting COF membrane exhibited superior performance in brine desalination with the permeation flux of 92&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and the rejection of 99.96&#8201;%. Our electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy enriches the fabrication approach of COF membranes and facilitates the rational design of ultrathin membranes.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Rigid&#8208;Flexible Hybrid Porous Molecular Crystals with Guest&#8208;Induced Reversible Crystallinity (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 13/2023)</title>

         <dc:description>
A rigid&#8208;flexible hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) with guest&#8208;induced reversible crystallinity was designed by Yingjie Zhao and Danbo Wang in their Research Article (e202217903). A specific compound, such as hexane, acts as a &#8220;key&#8221; to control the crystallinity, while the triangle macrocycle as the building module is the &#8220;lock&#8221;. The introduction and removal of the &#8220;key&#8221; molecule affects the local flexibility of the whole framework and leads to switchable crystallinity.

A specific compound, such as hexane, acts as a &#8220;key&#8221; to control the crystallinity, while the triangle macrocycle as the building module is the &#8220;lock&#8221;. The introduction and removal of the &#8220;key&#8221; molecule affects the local flexibility of the whole framework and leads to switchable crystallinity.

         <title>Inside Cover: Bending Actuation of Hydrogels through Rotation of Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motors (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 13/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven molecular motors were used as photoactive crosslinks in hydrogels. Their unidirectional rotation under UV light triggers a shift in the equilibrium swelling of the networks because of the creation of new entanglements. In their Research Article (e202300263), Nicolas Giuseppone and co&#8208;workers exploit this actuation to perform mechanical work and show that individual motors can lift loads at least 200 times heavier than their own molecular weight, reminiscent of ants in the macroscopic world.

The relationship between molecular configuration and charge transfer processes in near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) chromophores was studied, and subsequently instructed the engineering of an efficient NIR photosensitizer (PS), as reported by Wenbo Hu, Yuliang Xiao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202214875). The resulting NIR&#8208;II PS not only enables NIR&#8208;II image&#8208;guided in&#8197;vivo pulmonary coronavirus photo&#8208;ablation but also demonstrates a facile approach for the development of NIR heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PSs.

         <title>Towards Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy Exploration of Plasmonic&#8208;Mediated Phenomena at the Single&#8208;Nanoparticle Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemiluminescence microscopy is emerging as a high&#8208;throughput spectroscopic technique capable of elucidating plasmonic&#8208;related phenomena in operando conditions. In a recent work, Wei et&#8197;al. combine electrochemiluminescence microscopy and high resolution scanning electron microscopy to explore the plasmon&#8208;enhanced luminescence in gold nanostructures arrays, identifying two different enhancement mechanisms for isolated and coupled nanostructures.







Abstract
The rational design of functional plasmonic metasurfaces and metamaterials requires the development of high&#8208;throughput characterization techniques compatible with operando conditions and capable of addressing single&#8208;nanostructures. In their work, Wei et&#8197;al. demonstrate the use of electrochemiluminescence microscopy to investigate the mechanism behind plasmon&#8208;enhanced luminescence induced by gold nanostructures. The use of gold plasmonic arrays was exploited to achieve the rapid spectroscopic evaluation of all the individual nanostructures, and the correlation of the results with high&#8208; resolution electron microscopy analysis, guaranteeing a strict one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence. The authors were able to identify two different mechanisms for the enhancement of [Ru(bpy)3]2+&#8208;tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine electrochemiluminescence mediated by single gold nanoparticles and by small plasmonic clusters. In the future, the proposed characterization could be used for the rapid and in situ spectroscopic analysis of more complex plasmonic nanostructures and metasurfaces.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Chemistries Towards High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent work from Guo and co&#8208;workers who proposed a hybrid electrolyte strategy obtained by mixing H2O and dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) as solvents to build up a high&#8208;quality phosphate&#8208;based solid&#8208;state interphase layer is highlighted. This new solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) protects Zn metal anodes from corrosion and dendrite formation. Thus, ultrahigh Coulombic efficiencies and extended lifespan can be achieved.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) are deemed a promising technology for electrochemical energy storage due to their high safety, low cost, and high energy density. However, AZMBs still suffer from severe side reactions, including Zn dendrite formation and intrinsic hydrogen evolution reaction. In contrast to the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer that stabilizes Li/Na/K metal anodes in organic electrolytes, it is difficult to form an SEI layer on the Zn surface because of the difficulty in decomposing the salt anions within the narrow electrochemical potential window of water. A team from the University of Adelaide reports a novel pure or hybrid electrolyte with H2O by using dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) as solvent or co&#8208;solvent to construct a uniform and stable phosphate&#8208;based SEI layer (ZnP2O6 and Zn3(PO4)2). As a result, high Coulombic efficiencies and improved capacity retentions are obtained.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Bioactive Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein chemistry has evolved remarkably in the past decade, which has enabled the effective production of new molecules with novel physicochemical properties for biomedical research, and therapeutic applications. This minireview summarizes recent developments in chemical protein synthesis to produce bioactive proteins, with emphasis on novel analogs with promising in vitro and in vivo activity.







Abstract
Nature has developed a plethora of protein machinery to operate and maintain nearly every task of cellular life. These processes are tightly regulated via post&#8208;expression modifications&#8212;transformations that modulate intracellular protein synthesis, folding, and activation. Methods to prepare homogeneously and precisely modified proteins are essential to probe their function and design new bioactive modalities. Synthetic chemistry has contributed remarkably to protein science by allowing the preparation of novel biomacromolecules that are often challenging or impractical to prepare via common biological means. The ability to chemically build and precisely modify proteins has enabled the production of new molecules with novel physicochemical properties and programmed activity for biomedical research, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications. This minireview summarizes recent developments in chemical protein synthesis to produce bioactive proteins, with emphasis on novel analogs with promising in vitro and in vivo activity.

         <title>Characterization and Application of Supramolecular Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents an overview of supramolecular electronics, an emerging and rapidly growing field that converges supramolecular chemistry and single&#8208;molecule electronics. Intensive attention is paid to depicting the electrical properties of various individual supramolecular assemblies and the unique quantum effects during intermolecular charge transport. Moreover, the dynamic monitoring of the supramolecular assembly processes at the single&#8208;molecule scale and the application of supramolecular electronics are also discussed.







Abstract
The convergence of supramolecular chemistry and single&#8208;molecule electronics offers a new perspective on supramolecular electronics, and provides a new avenue toward understanding and application of intermolecular charge transport at the molecular level. In this review, we will provide an overview of the advances in the characterization technique for the investigation of intermolecular charge transport, and summarize the experimental investigation of several non&#8208;covalent interactions, including &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, hydrogen bonding, host&#8208;guest interactions and &#963;&#8208;&#963; interactions at the single&#8208;molecule level. We will also provide a perspective on supramolecular electronics and discuss the potential applications and future challenges.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Oxycarbenes: New Synthetic and Catalytic Applications beyond Group 6 Fischer Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxycarbenes have emerged as useful intermediates in synthetic chemistry. This Minireview summarizes early synthetic and catalytic applications of late&#8208;transition&#8208;metal oxycarbene complexes and highlights recent advances in free oxycarbene reactions and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving oxycarbenes.







Abstract
Oxycarbenes have emerged as useful intermediates in synthetic chemistry. Compared to the widely studied oxycarbene metal complexes bearing Group 6 metals, the synthetic and catalytic applications of oxycarbenes beyond Group 6 Fischer carbene complexes are less explored because of the difficulty in controlling their reactivity and the need to use a stoichiometric amount of a presynthesized Group 6 metal carbene complex as the starting material. This Minireview summarizes early synthetic and catalytic applications of late&#8208;transition&#8208;metal oxycarbene complexes and highlights recent advances in free oxycarbene reactions and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving oxycarbenes. We hope this Minireview will inspire further developments in this emerging area.

         <title>2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamentals of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), their synthesis, their advantages in photocatalysis, and the strategies for boosting their photocatalytic performance are summarized in this review. Current problems and their solutions are presented.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), a rising star in the post&#8208;graphene era, are fundamentally and technologically intriguing for photocatalysis. Their extraordinary electronic, optical, and chemical properties endow them as promising materials for effectively harvesting light and catalyzing the redox reaction in photocatalysis. Here, we present a tutorial&#8208;style review of the field of 2D TMDs for photocatalysis to educate researchers (especially the new&#8208;comers), which begins with a brief introduction of the fundamentals of 2D TMDs and photocatalysis along with the synthesis of this type of material, then look deeply into the merits of 2D TMDs as co&#8208;catalysts and active photocatalysts, followed by an overview of the challenges and corresponding strategies of 2D TMDs for photocatalysis, and finally look ahead this topic.

         <title>A Bidentate Ligand Featuring Ditopic Lewis Acids in the Second Sphere for Selective Substrate Capture and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of a bidentate ligand featuring secondary sphere ditopic Lewis acids. We verify a Lewis acid additivity effect for the ditopic boranes compared to a monotopic analogue using hydride ion affinity and competition studies. We show chemoselective nitrite capture in the presence of other anions. Pre&#8208;organized hydrazine adducts in the second sphere of Zn and Fe are functionalized to hydrazido and diazene ligands, respectively.







Abstract
We present a ligand platform featuring appended ditopic Lewis acids to facilitate capture/activation of diatomic substrates. We show that incorporation of two 9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9&#8208;BBN) units on a single carbon tethered to a pyridine pyrazole scaffold maintains a set of unquenched nitrogen donors available to coordinate FeII, ZnII, and NiII. Using hydride ion affinity and competition experiments, we establish an additive effect for ditopic secondary sphere boranes, compared to the monotopic analogue. These effects are exploited to achieve high selectivity for binding NO2&#8722; in the presence of competitive anions such as F&#8722; and NO3&#8722;. Finally, we demonstrate hydrazine capture within the second&#8208;sphere of metal complexes, followed by unique activation pathways to generate hydrazido and diazene ligands on Zn and Fe, respectively.

         <title>Ion Co&#8208;storage in Porous Organic Frameworks through On&#8208;site Coulomb Interactions for High Energy and Power Density Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Coulomb interaction&#8208;promoted ion kinetics enables a dual&#8208;ion co&#8208;storage electrode with high energy and power densities.







Abstract
Fast and continuous ion insertion is blocked in the common electrodes operating with widely accepted single&#8208;ion storage mechanism, primarily due to Coulomb repulsion between the same ions. It results in an irreconcilable conflict between capacity and rate performance. Herein, we designed a porous organic framework with novel multiple&#8208;ion co&#8208;storage modes, including PF6&#8722;/Li+, OTF&#8722;/Mg2+, and OTF&#8722;/Zn2+ co&#8208;storage. The Coulomb interactions between cationic and anionic carriers in the framework can significantly promote electrode kinetics, by rejuvenating fast ion carrier migration toward framework interior. Consequently, the framework via PF6&#8722;/Li+ co&#8208;storage mode shows a high energy density of 878&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 cycled more than 20&#8201;000 cycles, with an excellent power density of 28&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 that is already comparable to commercial supercapacitors. The both greatly improved energy and power densities via the co&#8208;storage mode may pave a way for exploring new electrodes that are not available from common single&#8208;ion electrodes.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Investigation, Storage, and Separation of Pyrophoric PH3 and P2H4 with &#945;&#8208;Mg Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>

Phosphane, PH3, is a highly pyrophoric and toxic gas that is often contaminated with H2 and P2H4. The inexpensive &#945;&#8208;Mg formate MOF adsorbs up to 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% of PH3 and allows safe handling of phosphane in air. This MOF is moreover a candidate for PH3 purification and longtime P2H4 storage in air and at room temperature.







Abstract
Phosphane, PH3&#8212;a highly pyrophoric and toxic gas&#8212;is frequently contaminated with H2 and P2H4, which makes its handling even more dangerous. The inexpensive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) magnesium formate, &#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2], can adsorb up to 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% of PH3. The PH3&#8208;loaded MOF, PH3@&#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2], is a non&#8208;pyrophoric, recoverable material that even allows brief handling in air, thereby minimizing the hazards associated with the handling and transport of phosphane. &#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2] further plays a critical role in purifying PH3 from H2 and P2H4: at 25&#8201;&#176;C, H2 passes through the MOF channels without adsorption, whereas PH3 adsorbs readily and only slowly desorbs under a flow of inert gas (complete desorption time&#8776;6&#8197;h). Diphosphane, P2H4, is strongly adsorbed and trapped within the MOF for at least 4&#8197;months. P2H4@&#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2] itself is not pyrophoric and is air&#8208; and light&#8208;stable at room temperature.

         <title>Tetranuclear CuII Cluster as the Ten Node Building Unit for the Construction of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ten&#8208;connected tetranuclear copper&#8208;based cluster node [Cu4(PO3)2(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)2(CO2)4] formed by the organic ligand H4L (3,5&#8208; dicarboxyphenylphosphonic acid) leads to a novel metal&#8211;organic framework FJU&#8208;112. BPE (1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane) divides the larger pore space of FJU&#8208;112 into a structure with smaller aperture size and infinite cages which greatly enhances the adsorption and selective separation performance for C2H2/CO2 mixtures.







Abstract
Rational design of high nuclear copper cluster&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks has not been established yet. Herein, we report a novel MOF (FJU&#8208;112) with the ten&#8208;connected tetranuclear copper cluster [Cu4(PO3)2(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)2(CO2)4] as the node which was capped by the deprotonated organic ligand of H4L (3,5&#8208;Dicarboxyphenylphosphonic acid). With BPE (1,2&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane) as the pore partitioner, the pore spaces in the structure of FJU&#8208;112 were divided into several smaller cages and smaller windows for efficient gas adsorption and separation. FJU&#8208;112 exhibits a high separation performance for the C2H2/CO2 separation, which were established by the temperature&#8208;dependent sorption isotherms and further confirmed by the lab&#8208;scale dynamic breakthrough experiments. The grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) studies show that its high C2H2/CO2 separation performance is contributed to the strong &#960;&#8208;complexation interactions between the C2H2 molecules and framework pore surfaces, leading to its more C2H2 uptakes over CO2 molecules.

The Ir&#8208;catalyzed borylation of porphine has led to the synthesis of the useful synthon 2,7,12,17&#8208;tetrakis(pinacolatoboryl) NiII porphyrin. This synthon was used for the preparation of tetraarylated NiII porphyrins, octaarylated NiII porphyrins, a quadruply bridged non&#8208;offset face&#8208;to&#8208;face porphyrin dimer, single&#8208;linked cross&#8208;shaped porphyrin pentamers and nonamers, as well as pentameric porphyrin tapes.







Abstract
2,7,12,17&#8208;Tetrakis(pinacolatoboryl) NiII porphyrin 5&#8201;Ni was synthesized in 75&#8201;% yield by Ir&#8208;catalyzed borylation of porphine followed by NiII metalation and has been demonstrated to be a useful synthon, giving 2,7,12,17&#8208;tetraaryated NiII porphyrins 6&#8201;a&#8211;d, peripherally octaarylated NiII porphyrins 8&#8201;a&#8211;d, quadruply bridged face&#8208;to&#8208;face non&#8208;offset NiII&#8208;porphyrin dimer 12, and cross&#8208;shaped &#946;&#8208;meso singly linked porphyrin pentamers and nonamers. Oxidation of cross&#8208;shaped &#946;&#8208;meso singly linked porphyrin pentamers 14&#8201;Ni and 14&#8201;Zn gave fused pentameric tapes 15&#8201;Ni and 15&#8201;Zn. The structures of 12, 14&#8201;Zn, and 15&#8201;Ni have been revealed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Optical separation of 12 has been accomplished, showing a bisignate coupling pattern for exciton&#8208;coupled blue&#8208;shifted Soret band. Pentameric porphyrin tape 15&#8201;Zn exhibits a red&#8208;shifted absorption band at 1156&#8197;nm and seven reversible redox waves.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Centered Lewis Superacid through Redox&#8208;Active Ligands: Application in C&#8722;F and S&#8722;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of ferrocenyl&#8208;substituted boranes and boronic esters allows for the straightforward synthesis of strong boron&#8208;centered Lewis superacids. The Lewis superacids were characterized by NMR, XRD and FIA computation. The ferrocenium&#8208;substituted boranes were applied in catalytic C&#8722;F and S&#8722;F bond activations.







Abstract
A series of redox&#8208;responsive ferrocenyl&#8208;substituted boranes and boronic esters were synthesized. Oxidation of the ferrocenyl ligand to the ferrocenium resulted in a drastic increase in the Lewis acidity beyond the strength of SbF5, which was investigated experimentally and computationally. The resulting highly Lewis acidic boron compounds were used for catalytic C&#8722;F and S&#8722;F bond activation.

&lt;p&gt;The oxidation of ferrocenyl-substituted boranes and boronic esters allows for the straightforward synthesis of strong boron-centered Lewis superacids. The Lewis superacids were characterized by NMR, XRD and FIA computation. The ferrocenium-substituted boranes were applied in catalytic C&#8722;F and S&#8722;F bond activations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of redox-responsive ferrocenyl-substituted boranes and boronic esters were synthesized. Oxidation of the ferrocenyl ligand to the ferrocenium resulted in a drastic increase in the Lewis acidity beyond the strength of SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, which was investigated experimentally and computationally. The resulting highly Lewis acidic boron compounds were used for catalytic C&#8722;F and S&#8722;F bond activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halide Layer Cathodes for Compatible and Fast&#8208;Charged Halides&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lithium intercalation chemistry in layered VX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) enabled by compatible halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes was explored for the first time. The electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial stability can be achieved in a thermodynamic manner instead of by passivation, ensured by the good chemical stability between the VX3 cathode and halide electrolytes as well as the wide electrochemical stability windows.







Abstract
Insertion&#8208;type compounds based on oxides and sulfides have been widely identified and well&#8208;studied as cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, halides have rarely been used due to their high solubility in organic liquid electrolytes. Here, we reveal the insertion electrochemistry of VX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) by introducing a compatible halide solid&#8208;state electrolyte with a wide electrochemical stability window. X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure analyses reveal a two&#8208;step lithiation process and the structural transition of typical VCl3. Fast Li+ insertion/extraction in the layered VX3 active materials and favorable interface guaranteed by the compatible electrode&#8208;electrolyte design enables high rate capability and stable operation of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;VX3 batteries. The findings from this study will contribute to developing intercalation insertion electrochemistry of halide materials and exploring novel electrode materials in viable energy storage systems.

         <title>Dendronized DNA Chimeras Harness Scavenger Receptors To Degrade Cell Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient dendronized DNA chimera (DENTAC) strategy for targeted membrane protein degradation is reported. DENTAC comprises a protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest (POI) binder linked with a dendritic DNA, which engages cell surface scavenger receptors (SRs) to transport the POI into the lysosome for degradation.







Abstract
Bispecific chimeras bridging cell membrane proteins with lysosome&#8208;trafficking receptors (LTRs) provide an effective therapeutic approach through lysosomal degradation of disease&#8208;relevant targets. Here, we report a novel dendronized DNA chimera (DENTAC) strategy that uses a dendritic DNA to engage cell surface scavenger receptors (SRs) as LTR. Using bioorthogonal strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition to conjugate the dendritic DNA with protein binder, the resulting DENTAC is able to traffic the protein target into the lysosome for elimination. We demonstrated the utility of DENTAC by degrading oncogenic membrane nucleolin (NCL) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The anti&#8208;cancer application of NCL&#8208;targeting DENTAC was validated in a mouse xenograft model of lung cancer. This work thus presents a new avenue for rapid development of potent degraders against membrane proteins, with also broad research and therapeutic prospects.

         <title>Enantioselective Intermolecular Radical Amidation and Amination of Benzylic C&#8722;H Bonds via Dual Copper and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for enantioselective intermolecular benzylic C&#8722;H amidation and amination is reported. This dehydrogenative C&#8722;N bond formation displays broad substrate scope and good atom economy, is amenable to late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization, and enables easy access to 15N&#8208;labeling from cheap [15N]&#8208;NH4Cl.







Abstract
A method for direct access to enantioenriched benzylic amides and carbamate&#8208;protected primary benzylamines by C&#8722;H functionalization is reported. The C&#8722;H substrate is used as limiting reagent with only a small excess of the unactivated amide or carbamate nucleophile. The enantioselective intermolecular dehydrogenative C&#8722;N bond formation is enabled by a combination of a chiral copper catalyst, a photocatalyst, and an oxidant, and it takes place under mild conditions, which allow for a broad substrate scope. The method is compatible with late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization, and it provides easy access to 15N&#8208;labeled amides and amines starting from cheap 15NH4Cl.

         <title>Pulsed Electrocatalysis Enabling High Overall Nitrogen Fixation Performance for Atomically Dispersed Fe on TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Fe was designed on TiO2 and explored as a Janus electrocatalyst for both nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) in a two&#8208;electrode system. Pulsed electrochemical catalysis (PE) was further involved to inhibit the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for superior nitrogen fixation performance.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed Fe was designed on TiO2 and explored as a Janus electrocatalyst for both nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) in a two&#8208;electrode system. Pulsed electrochemical catalysis (PE) was firstly involved to inhibit the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Excitingly, an unanticipated yield of 7055.81&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1cat. and 12&#8201;868.33&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1cat. were obtained for NOR and NRR at 3.5&#8197;V, respectively, 44.94 times and 7.8 times increase in FE than the conventional constant voltage electrocatalytic method. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the single&#8208;atom Fe could stabilize the oxygen vacancy, lower the energy barrier for the vital rupture of N&#8801;N, and result in enhanced N2 fixation performance. More importantly, PE could effectively enhance the N2 supply by reducing competitive O2 and H2 agglomeration, inhibit the electrocatalytic by&#8208;product formation for longstanding *OOH and *H intermediates, and promote the non&#8208;electrocatalytic process of N2 activation.

Preferential adsorption of ethylene oxide on Fe and chlorine on Ni enabled the electrosynthesis of ethylene chlorohydrin (ECH) with high conversion and selectivity. Scalable production of 185.1&#8197;mmol of ECH with 92.5&#8201;% yield at 55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;h, paired synthesis of ECH and 4&#8208;amino&#8208;3,6&#8208;dichloropyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid (an herbicide), and successful fabrication of a series of other chloro&#8208; and bromoethanols highlight the potential utilities.







Abstract
Industrial manufacturing of ethylene chlorohydrin (ECH) critically requires excess corrosive hydrochloric acid or hypochlorous acid with dealing with massive by&#8208;products and wastes. Here we report a green and efficient electrosynthesis of ECH from ethylene oxide (EO) with NaCl over a NiFe2O4 nanosheet anode. Theoretical results suggest that EO and Cl preferentially adsorb on Fe and Ni sites, respectively, collaboratively promoting the ECH synthesis. A Cl radical&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening process is proposed and confirmed, and the key Cl and carbon radical species are identified by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. This strategy can enable scalable electrosynthesis of 185.1&#8197;mmol of ECH in 1&#8197;h with 92.5&#8201;% yield at a 55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density. Furthermore, a series of other chloro&#8208; and bromoethanols with good to high yields and paired synthesis of ECH and 4&#8208;amino&#8208;3,6&#8208;dichloropyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylicacid via respectively loading and unloading Cl are achieved, showing the promising potential of this strategy.

         <title>Enabled Efficient Ammonia Synthesis and Energy Supply in a Zinc&#8211;Nitrate Battery System by Separating Nitrate Reduction Process into Two Stages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>

For the efficient electrocatalytic conversion of NO3&#8722; to NH3, a two&#8208;stage process following the [2+6]&#8208;electron pathway is proposed inspired by biological nitrate respiration. This system produces NO2&#8722; and NH3 at low overpotentials (&gt;+0.1 vs. RHE), resulting in a low energy consumption of 17.7&#8197;kWh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 for NH3 production and high energy density of 566.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery.







Abstract
The aqueous electrocatalytic reduction of NO3&#8722; into NH3 (NitrRR) presents a sustainable route applicable to NH3 production and potentially energy storage. However, the NitrRR involves a directly eight&#8208;electron transfer process generally required a large overpotential (&lt;&#8722;0.2&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE)) to reach optimal efficiency. Here, inspired by biological nitrate respiration, the NitrRR was separated into two stages along a [2+6]&#8208;electron pathway to alleviate the kinetic barrier. The system employed a Cu nanowire catalyst produces NO2&#8722; and NH3 with current efficiencies of 91.5&#8201;% and 100&#8201;%, respectively at lower overpotentials (&gt;+0.1 vs. RHE). The high efficiency for such a reduction process was further explored in a zinc&#8208;nitrate battery. This battery could be specified by a high output voltage of 0.70&#8197;V, an average energy density of 566.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a power density of 14.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is well beyond all previously reported similar concepts.

         <title>Optically Controlled Recovery and Recycling of Homogeneous Organocatalysts Enabled by Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable organocatalysts have been generated that undergo reversible dissolution and precipitation upon photo&#8208;irradiation. The insoluble solid&#8208;state catalysts are photo&#8208;switched to form soluble isomers that activate and complete two types of base&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Irradiation with visible light promotes the precipitation of the catalyst with a recovery rate of 87&#8201;%, which can be reused in multiple rounds of subsequent reactions.







Abstract
We address a critical challenge of recovering and recycling homogeneous organocatalysts by designing photoswitchable catalyst structures that display a reversible solubility change in response to light. Initially insoluble catalysts are UV&#8208;switched to a soluble isomeric state, which catalyzes the reaction, then back&#8208;isomerizes to the insoluble state upon completion of the reaction to be filtered and recycled. The molecular design principles that allow for the drastic solubility change over 10 times between the isomeric states, 87&#8201;% recovery by the light&#8208;induced precipitation, and multiple rounds of catalyst recycling are revealed. This proof of concept will open up opportunities to develop highly recyclable homogeneous catalysts that are important for the synthesis of critical compounds in various industries, which is anticipated to significantly reduce environmental impact and costs.

Here, we discover new lithium&#8208;metal&#8208;oxy&#8208;halide materials, LiMOCl4 (M=Nb, Ta). They exhibit extremely high ionic conductivities of 10.4&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for M=Nb and 12.4&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for M=Ta, respectively, even in cold&#8208;pressed powder forms at room temperature, which are comparable to or surpass those of organic liquid electrolytes used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) with inorganic solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted significant interest as next&#8208;generation energy storage. Halides such as Li3YCl6 are promising candidates for SE because they combine high oxidation stability and deformability. However, the ionic conductivities of halide SEs are not as high as those of other SEs, especially sulfides. Here, we discover new lithium&#8208;metal&#8208;oxy&#8208;halide materials, LiMOCl4 (M=Nb, Ta). They exhibit extremely high ionic conductivities of 10.4&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for M=Nb and 12.4&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for M=Ta, respectively, even in cold&#8208;pressed powder forms at room temperature, which are comparable to or surpass those of organic liquid electrolytes used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Bulk&#8208;type ASSB cells using the oxyhalides as the cathode SE demonstrate an outstanding rate capability with a capacity retention of 80&#8201;% at 5&#8197;C/0.1&#8197;C. We believe that the proposed oxyhalides are promising SE candidates for the practical applications of ASSBs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise separation of Ca2+, Mg2+ and Li+ has been achieved by liquid&#8208;liquid extraction employing a series of advanced 4&#8208;phosphoryl pyrazolone ligands together with TOPO (trioctylphosphine oxide) as co&#8208;ligand via pH regulation. X&#8208;ray crystal structure determinations of selected complexes revealed diverse binding modes across all three metal species.







Abstract
Ensuring continuous and sustainable lithium supply requires the development of highly efficient separation processes such as LLE (liquid&#8208;liquid extraction) for both primary sources and certain waste streams. In this work, 4&#8208;phosphoryl pyrazolones are used in an efficient pH&#8208;controlled stepwise separation of Li+ from Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+. The factors affecting LLE process, such as the substitution pattern of the extractant, diluent/water distribution, co&#8208;ligand, pH, and speciation of the metal complexes involved, were systematically investigated. The maximum extraction efficiency of Li+ at pH&#8197;6.0 was 94&#8201;% when Mg2+ and Ca2+ were previously separated at pH&lt;5.0, proving that the separation of these ions is possible by simply modulating the pH of the aqueous phase. Our study points a way to separation of lithium from acid brine or from spent lithium ion battery leaching solutions, which supports the future supply of lithium in a more environmentally friendly and sustainable manner.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Arylation of Cyclobutenone Ketals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report bench&#8208;stable cyclobutenone surrogates that undergo Rh&#8208;catalyzed addition of aryl&#8208; and vinylboronic acids to yield cyclobutenyl enol ethers in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities. This transformation proceeds via enantioselective carbometalation to give cyclobutyl&#8208;rhodium intermediates, followed by &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination. The reaction is fast and proceeds under mild conditions.







Abstract
Complex cyclobutanes are important motifs in both bioactive molecules and natural products, yet their enantioselective preparation has not been widely explored. In this work, we describe rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective additions of aryl and vinyl boronic acids to cyclobutenone ketals. This transformation involves enantioselective carbometalation to give cyclobutyl&#8208;rhodium intermediates, followed by &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination to afford enantioenriched enol ethers. Overall, this addition serves as a surrogate for Rh&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;additions to cyclobutenone.

         <title>Tandem Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia on MBenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 13, March 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MBenes are demonstrated to be a new class of tandem catalysts for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR). Taking FeB2 as the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept paradigm, mechanistic studies unveil that the synergistic tandem effect of Fe and B atoms promotes NO3&#8722; activation and intermediate hydrogenation to enhance the NO3RR activity and selectivity.







Abstract
We demonstrate the great feasibility of MBenes as a new class of tandem catalysts for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR). As a proof of concept, FeB2 is first employed as a model MBene catalyst for the NO3RR, showing a maximum NH3&#8208;Faradaic efficiency of 96.8&#8201;% with a corresponding NH3 yield of 25.5&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. RHE. Mechanistic studies reveal that the exceptional NO3RR activity of FeB2 arises from the tandem catalysis mechanism, that is, B sites activate NO3&#8722; to form intermediates, while Fe sites dissociate H2O and increase *H supply on B sites to promote the intermediate hydrogenation and enhance the NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion.

         <title>Transformation of Imine Cage to Covalent Organic Framework Film at the Liquid&#8208;Liquid Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) opens up a fascinating route for the construction of well&#8208;organized supramolecular architectures, starting from organic molecular cages to crystalline macromolecular covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Herein, for the first time, we have manifested a facile room&#8208;temperature DCC&#8208;directed transformation of discrete organic imine cage&#8208;to&#8208;COF film at the liquid&#8208;liquid interface. The unfolding of the cage leading to the generation of imine intermediates, followed by their interface&#8208;assisted preorganization and subsequent growth of the COF film, are elucidated through detailed spectroscopic and microscopic investigations. The interfacial cage&#8208;to&#8208;COF transformation provides a facile route for the faster fabrication of free&#8208;standing COF films with high porosity and crystallinity, demonstrating excellent performance towards molecular sieving and high solvent permeance. Thus, the current study opens up a new route for structural interconversion between two crystalline entities with diverse dimensionality employing DCC at the confined interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Microenvironment in Monolayer MgAl Layered Double Hydroxide for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Electrocatalysis in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide provides a feasibility to achieve a carbon&#8208;neutral energy cycle. However, there are a number of bottleneck issues to be resolved before industrial application, such as the low conversion efficiency, selectivity and reaction rate, etc. Engineering local environment is a critical way to address these challenges. Here, a monolayer MgAl&#8208;LDH was proposed to optimize the local environment of Cu for stimulating industrial&#8208;current&#8208;density CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 electroreduction in neutral media. In situ spectroscopic results and theoretical study demonstrated that the Cu electrode modified by MgAl&#8208;LDH (MgAl&#8208;LDH/Cu) displayed a much higher surface pH value compared to the bare Cu, which could be attributed to the decreased energy barrier for hydrolysis on MgAl&#8208;LDH sites with more OH&#8208; ions on the surface of the electrode. As a result, MgAl&#8208;LDH/Cu achieved a C2H4 Faradaic efficiency of 55.1% at a current density up to 300 mA cm&#8208;2 in 1.0 M KHCO3 electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of the Orthorhombic Sn3O4 Polymorph</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unexplored tin oxide crystal phase (Sn3O4) was experimentally synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. After tuning the often&#8208;neglected parameters for the hydrothermal synthesis, namely the degree of filling of the precursor solution and the gas composition in the reactor head space, an unreported X&#8208;ray diffraction pattern was discovered. Through various characterization studies, such as Rietveld analysis, energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, and first&#8208;principles calculations, this novel material was characterized as orthorhombic mixed&#8208;valence tin oxide with the composition Sn(II)2Sn(IV)O4. This orthorhombic tin oxide is a new polymorph of Sn3O4, which differs from the reported conventional monoclinic structure. Computational and experimental analyses showed that orthorhombic Sn3O4 has a smaller bandgap (2.0 eV), enabling greater absorption of visible light. This study is expected to improve the accuracy of hydrothermal synthesis and aid the discovery of new oxide materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Polydopamine as a visible&#8208;light photosensitiser for photoinitiated polymerisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polydopamine (PDA) is a synthetic model for melanin and has a wide range of opto&#8208;electronic properties that underpin its utility in applied and biological settings, from broadband light absorbance to possessing stable free radical species. Here, we show that PDA free radicals are photo&#8208;responsive under visible light irradiation, enabling PDA to serve as a photo&#8208;redox catalyst. Steady&#8208;state and transient electron spin resonance spectroscopy reveals a reversible amplification in semiquinone radical population within PDA under visible irradiation. This photo&#8208;response modifies the redox potential of PDA and supports sensitisation of exogenous species via photoinduced electron transfer (PET). We demonstrate the utility of this discovery by employing PDA nanoparticles to photosensitise a common diaryliodonium photoinitiator and initiate free&#8208;radical polymerisation (FRP) of vinylic monomers. In situ1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals an interplay between PDA&#8208;driven photosensitising and radical quenching during FRP under blue, green, and red light. This work provides crucial insights into the photoactive free radical properties of melanin&#8208;like materials and reveals a promising new application for polydopamine as a photosensitiser.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Anchored Molybdenum Oxide Nanoclusters as Efficient Catalysts for the Electrosynthesis of Ammonia and Urea</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical NO3&#8208; reduction and its coupling with CO2 can provide novel and clean routes to synthesize NH3 and urea, respectively. However, their practical application is still impeded by the lack of efficient catalysts with desirable Faradaic efficiency (FE) and yield rate. Herein, we report the synthesis of molybdenum oxide nanoclusters anchored on carbon black (MoOx/C) as electrocatalyst. It affords an outstanding FE of 98.14% and NH3 yield rate of 91.63 mg h&#8208;1 mgcat.&#8208;1 in NO3&#8208; reduction. Besides, the highest FE of 27.7% with a maximum urea yield rate of 1431.5 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mgcat.&#8208;1 toward urea is also achieved. The formation of electron&#8208;rich MoOx nanoclusters with highly unsaturated metal sites in the MoOx/C heterostructure is beneficial for enhanced catalytic performance. Studies on the mechanism reveal that the stabilization of *NO and *CO2NOOH intermediates are critical for the NH3 and urea synthesis, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient Opal&#8208;Suppressor Tryptophanyl Pair Creates New Routes for Simultaneously Incorporating up to Three Distinct Noncanonical Amino Acids into Proteins in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific incorporation of multiple distinct noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in mammalian cells is a promising technology, where each ncAA must be assigned to a different orthogonal aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/tRNA pair that read a distinct nonsense codon. Available pairs suppress TGA or TAA codons at a considerably lower efficiency than TAG, limiting the scope of this technology. Here we show that the E. coli tryptophanyl (EcTrp) pair is an excellent TGA&#8208;suppressor in mammalian cells, which can be combined with the three other established pairs to develop three new routes for dual&#8208;ncAA incorporation. Using these platforms, we site&#8208;specifically incorporated two different bioconjugation handles into an antibody with excellent efficiency, and subsequently labeled it with two distinct cytotoxic payloads. Additionally, we combined the EcTrp pair with other pairs to site&#8208;specifically incorporate three distinct ncAAs into a reporter protein in mammalian cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Gd(III)&#8208;19F Distance Measurements of Proteins in Cells by Electron&#8208;Nuclear Double Resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Studies of protein structure and dynamics are usually carried out in dilute buffer solutions, conditions that differ significantly from the crowded environment in the cell. The double electron&#8208;electron resonance (DEER) technique can track proteins&#8217; conformations in the cell by providing distance distributions between two attached spin labels. This technique, however, cannot access distances below 1.8 nm. Here we show that Gd(III)&#8208;19F Mims electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) measurements can cover part of this short range. Low temperature solution and in&#8208;cell ENDOR measurements, complemented with room temperature solution and in&#8208;cell Gd(III)&#8208;19F PRE (paramagnetic relaxation enhancement) NMR measurements were performed on fluorinated GB1 and ubiquitin (Ub), spin&#8208;labeled with rigid Gd(III) tags. The proteins were delivered into human cells via electroporation. The solution and in&#8208;cell derived Gd(III)&#8208;19F distances were essentially identical and lie in the 1&#8208;1.5 nm range revealing that both, GB1 and Ub, retained their overall structure in the cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical&#8208;Mediated Regenerable Fe(II) Active Sites for Efficient Uranium Extraction at Ultra&#8208;Low Cell Voltage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient extraction of uranium from seawater or wastewater has attracted great attention due to the increasing demand for nuclear energy. Nano&#8208;reduced iron (NRI) is a promising uranium adsorbent due to its strong reducibility and good selectivity but it still faces the challenges of slow kinetics, limited and non&#8208;renewable active sites. In this work, we realized high efficiency uranium extraction under ultra&#8208;low cell voltage (&#8208;0.1 V) in seawater with 20 ppm UO2(NO3)2&#160;solution by coupling electrochemical mediated Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox and uranium extraction.&#160;The adsorption capacity and extraction efficiency of NRI after electrochemical uranium extraction (EUE) could reach 456.37 mg/g and ~100 %, respectively. The excellent EUE property was attributed to the rich chloride ions in seawater promoting the formation of chlorine intermediate species which boosted the formation of iron oxides (Fe2O3&#160;and FeOOH), thus accelerating the reduction of U(VI), release of adsorption sites (M&#8208;OH groups) and regeneration of Fe(II) active sites. Combined with quasi&#8208;operando/operando characterization technologies, we clarified the mechanism&#160;of EUE and revealed that continuously regenerating Fe(II) active sites by electroreduction could significantly enhance the property of EUE. This work here provides a new electrochemical mediated and low energy consumption uranium extraction strategy which also provides a reference for other metal resource recovery.</dc:description>

Nano-reduced iron (NRI) is a promising uranium adsorbent due to its strong reducibility and good selectivity but it still faces the challenges of slow kinetics, limited and non-renewable active sites.

The excellent EUE property was attributed to the rich chloride ions in seawater promoting the formation of chlorine intermediate species which boosted the formation of iron oxides (Fe2O3&#160;and FeOOH), thus accelerating the reduction of U(VI), release of adsorption sites (M-OH groups) and regeneration of Fe(II) active sites. Combined with quasi-operando/operando characterization technologies, we clarified the mechanism&#160;of EUE and revealed that continuously regenerating Fe(II) active sites by electroreduction could significantly enhance the property of EUE.

         <title>Targeting the Dark Lipid Kinase PIP4K2C with a&#160;Potent and Selective Binder and Degrader</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphatidylinositol 5&#8208;phosphate 4&#8208;kinase, type II, gamma (PIP4K2C) remains a poorly understood lipid kinase with minimal enzymatic activity but potential scaffolding roles in immune modulation and autophagy&#8208;dependent catabolism. Achieving potent and selective agents for PIP4K2C while sparing other lipid and non&#8208;lipid kinases has been challenging. Here, we report the discovery of the highly potent PIP4K2C binder TMX&#8208;4102, which shows exclusive binding selectivity for PIP4K2C. Furthermore, we elaborated this molecule into TMX&#8208;4153, a bivalent degrader capable of rapidly and selectively degrading endogenous PIP4K2C. Collectively, our work demonstrates that PIP4K2C is a tractable and a degradable target, and that TMX&#8208;4102 and TMX&#8208;4153 are useful leads to further interrogate the biological roles and therapeutic potential of PIP4K2C</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely Slight Regulation of Emission Maxima and Construction of Highly Efficient Electroluminescent Materials with High Color Purity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advanced multiple resonance induced thermally activated delayed &#64258;uorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters have emerged as a privileged motif for applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), because they furnish highly tunable bandgap with emission ranges spanning the visible light region, and have the intrinsic properties of outstanding TADF characteristics and high color purity emission. One of the typical construction paradigms of MR&#8208;TADF molecule is based on polycyclization of MR parent core and a representative target model molecule BN&#8208;TP has been prepared. Herein, based on the unique nitrogen&#8208;atom embedding molecular engineering (NEME) strategy, a series of congeners of BN&#8208;TP, namely BN&#8208;TP&#8208;Nx (x = 1, 2, 3, 4), have been customized. The nitrogen&#8208;atom anchored at different position of triphenylene hexagonal lattice entails varying degrees of perturbation to the electronic structure. The newly&#8208;constructed emitters have demonstrated the precisely slight regulation of emission maxima of MR&#8208;TADF emitters to meet the actual industrial demand, and further enormously enriched the MR&#8208;TADF molecular reservoir. The BN&#8208;TP&#8208;N3&#8208;based OLED exhibits ultrapure green emission, with peak of 524 nm, full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 33 nm, Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.23, 0.71), and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.3%.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Isodesmic C&#8211;H Iodination of Phenylacetic Weinreb Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isodesmic reactions represent mild alternatives to other chemical transformations that require harsh oxidizing agents or highly reactive intermediates. However, enantioselective isodesmic C&#8211;H functionalization is unknown and enantioselective direct iodination of inert C&#8211;H bond is very rare. Rapid synthesis of chiral aromatic iodides is of significant importance for synthetic chemistry. Herein, we report an unprecedented highly enantioselective isodesmic C&#8211;H functionalization to access chiral iodinated phenylacetic Weinreb amides via desymmetrization and kinetic resolution with PdII catalysis. Importantly, further transformations of the enantioenriched products are readily available at the iodinated or the Weinreb amide position, paving the way of related studies for synthetic and medicinal chemists.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four highly porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) containing pyrene units were prepared and explored for photocatalytic H2O2 production. The experimental studies are complemented by density functional theory calculations, proving that the pyrene unit is more active for H2O2 production than the bipyridine and (diarylamino)benzene units reported previously. H2O2 decomposition experiments verified that the distribution of pyrene units over a large surface area of COFs plays an important role in catalytic performance. The Py&#8208;Py&#8208;COF, though contains more pyrene units than other COFs, induces a high H2O2 decomposition due to a dense concentration of pyrene in small proximity over a limited surface area. Therefore, a two&#8208;phase reaction system (water&#8208;benzyl alcohol) was employed to&#160;inhibit H2O2 decomposition. This is the first report on applying pyrene&#8208;based COFs in a two&#8208;phase system for photocatalytic H2O2 generation.</dc:description>

         <title>From Dinitrogen to N&#8208;Containing Organic Compounds: Using Li2CN2 as a Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By synergizing the heterogeneous synthetic approach with the homogeneous synthetic methodology, N&#8208;containing organic compounds can be synthesized via activated N&#8208;containing species prepared from N2 gas and suitable carbon sources. From N2, carbon, and LiH, we have previously succeeded in the high&#8208;yield preparation of Li2CN2 as the activated N&#8208;containing species. In this work, we applied Li2CN2 as a novel synthetic synthon for constructing N&#8208;containing organic compounds. A series of reaction models, including substitution reaction, cycloaddition reaction, and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction, were successfully performed using Li2CN2 under mild conditions. Various valuable cyanamides, carbodiimides, N&#8208;aryl cyanamides and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives were readily synthesized in moderate to excellent yields. With this method, the 15N&#8208;labeled products, including oxazolidine derivatives with anti&#8208;cancer activity, could also be facilely prepared from 15N2 gas.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mismatched fast&#8208;electron&#8208;slow&#8208;proton process in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) severely restricts the catalytic efficiency.

Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the metal units and TA2-, the optimized catalyst delivers superior activity with a low overpotential of 270 mV at 200 mA cm-2 and excellent cycling stability over 300 h. A proton-transfer-promotion mechanism is proposed by in-situ Raman, catalytic tests, and theoretical calculations. The TA2- (proton acceptor) can mediate proton transfer pathways by preferentially accepting protons, which optimizes the O-H adsorption/activation process and reduces the kinetic barrier for O-O bond formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonylation of Aryl Bromides Enabled by Potassium Metabisulfite as a Uniquely Effective SO2 Surrogate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development and mechanistic investigation of a nickel&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of aryl bromides is disclosed. The reaction proceeds in good yields for a variety of substrates and utilizes an inexpensive, stench&#8208;free, inorganic sulfur salt (K2S2O5) as a uniquely effective SO2 surrogate. The active oxidative addition complex was synthesized, isolated, and fully characterized by a combination of NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis. The use of the isolated oxidative addition complex in both stoichiometric and catalytic reactions revealed that SO2 insertion occurs via dissolved SO2, likely released upon thermal decomposition of K2S2O5. Key to the success of the reaction is the role of K2S2O5 as a reservoir of SO2 that is slowly released, thus preventing catalyst poisoning.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Synthesis of Benzotriazulene with Three Embedded Azulene Units and Large Stokes Shifts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here the one&#8208;pot synthesis of benzo[1,2&#8208;a:3,4&#8208;a':5,6&#8208;a'']triazulene (BTA), wherein three azulene units are embedded through a tandem reaction comprising of two steps involving Suzuki coupling and Knoevenagel condensation between a readily available triborylated truxene precursor and 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde. Its nitration leads to a regioselective trinitrated product, namely, BTA&#8208;NO2. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed that the superstructure of BTA consists of a dimer stacked by two enantiomeric helicene conformers, while that of BTA&#8208;NO2 consists of an unprecedented p&#8208;tetramer stacked from two enantiomeric dimers, that is, four distinct helicene conformers. Both compounds show excellent stability and fluorescence with large Stokes shifts of up to 174 nm. In addition, BTA&#8208;NO2 exhibits unique solvatochromic effect in different solvents and hydrogen bonding&#8208;induced emission transfer in different ratios of THF/H2O solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unsupervised Learning&#8208;Guided Accelerated Discovery of Alkaline Anion Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Without insight into the correlation between the structure and properties, anion exchange membranes (AEMs) for fuel cells are developed usually using the empirical trial and error method or simulation methods. Here, a virtual module compound enumeration screening (V&#8208;MCES) approach, which does not require the establishment of expensive training databases and can search the chemical space containing more than 4.2&#215;105 candidates was proposed. The accuracy of the V&#8208;MCES model was considerably improved when the model was combined with supervised learning for the feature selection of molecular descriptors. Techniques from V&#8208;MCES, correlating the molecular structures of the AEMs with the predicted chemical stability, generated a ranking list of potential high stability AEMs. Under the guidance of V&#8208;MCES, highly stable AEMs were synthesized. With understanding of AEM structure and performance by machine learning, AEM science may enter a new era of unprecedented levels of architectural design.</dc:description>

         <title>Cd/Pt Precursor Solution for Solar H2 Production and in situ Photochemical Synthesis of Pt Single&#8208;atom Decorated CdS Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the use of Cd/Pt precursor solutions for substantially higher photocatalytic H2 production (154.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), thereby eliminating the need for pre&#8208;synthesized photocatalysts for H2 production. Furthermore, in parallel to H2 production, a simplified solar light&#8208;assisted in situ synthesis of Pt single&#8208;atom anchored CdS nanoparticles (PtSA&#8208;CdSIS) has also been demonstrated.







Abstract
Despite extensive efforts to develop high&#8208;performance H2 evolution catalysts, this remains a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate the use of Cd/Pt precursor solutions for significant photocatalytic H2 production (154.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), removing the need for a pre&#8208;synthesized photocatalyst. In addition, we also report simultaneous in situ synthesis of Pt single&#8208;atoms anchored CdS nanoparticles (PtSA&#8208;CdSIS) during photoirradiation. The highly dispersed in situ incorporation of extensive Pt single atoms on CdSIS enables the enhancement of active sites and suppresses charge recombination, which results in exceptionally high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of &#8776;1&#8201;% and an apparent quantum yield of over 91&#8201;% (365&#8197;nm) for H2 production. Our work not only provides a promising strategy for maximising H2 production efficiency but also provides a green process for H2 production and the synthesis of highly photoactive PtSA&#8208;CdSIS nanoparticles.

Here, we demonstrate the use of Cd/Pt precursor solutions for significant photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production (154.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), removing the need for a pre-synthesized photocatalyst. In addition, we also report simultaneous in situ synthesis of Pt single-atoms anchored CdS nanoparticles (Pt&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;-CdS&lt;sub&gt;IS&lt;/sub&gt;) during photoirradiation. The highly dispersed in situ incorporation of extensive Pt single atoms on CdS&lt;sub&gt;IS&lt;/sub&gt; enables the enhancement of active sites and suppresses charge recombination, which results in exceptionally high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of &#8776;1&#8201;% and an apparent quantum yield of over 91&#8201;% (365&#8197;nm) for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. Our work not only provides a promising strategy for maximising H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production efficiency but also provides a green process for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production and the synthesis of highly photoactive Pt&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;-CdS&lt;sub&gt;IS&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Application of a Water&#8208;soluble Photocage for Aqueous Cyclopentadiene&#8208;based Diels&#8208;Alder Photoclick Chemistry in Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble cyclopentadienone&#8208;norbornadiene adduct is disclosed as a photocage for cyclopentadiene&#8208;based Diels&#8208;Alder photoclick chemistry. We show that this scalable CPD&#8211;NBD derivative can be incorporated into hydrogel formulations and commercial 3D printing resins, providing biocompatible hydrogels that can be patterned with maleimide bearing species upon 365&#8197;nm uncaging of cyclopentadiene.







Abstract
Spatiotemporally functionalized hydrogels have exciting applications in tissue engineering, but their preparation often relies on radical&#8208;based strategies that can be deleterious in biological settings. Herein, the computationally guided design, synthesis, and application of a water&#8208;soluble cyclopentadienone&#8208;norbornadiene (CPD&#8208;NBD) adduct is disclosed as a diene photocage for radical&#8208;free Diels&#8208;Alder photopatterning. We show that this scalable CPD&#8208;NBD derivative is readily incorporated into hydrogel formulations, providing gels that can be patterned with dienophiles upon 365&#8197;nm uncaging of cyclopentadiene. Patterning is first visualized through conjugation of cyanine dyes, then biological utility is highlighted by patterning peptides to direct cellular adhesion. Finally, the ease of use and versatility of this CPD&#8208;NBD derivative is demonstrated by direct incorporation into a commercial 3D printing resin to enable the photopatterning of structurally complex, printed hydrogels.

         <title>Suppressive Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions on Ruthenium/TiO2 Promote Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal CO2 Reduction with Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) of has gained great attention in the heterogeneous catalysis, but its negative role in regulating light&#8208;induced electrons transfer is rarely explored. Herein,&#160;SMSI significantly restrains the activity of Ru/TiO2 in light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction by CH4 due to the photo&#8208;induced electrons transfer from TiO2 to Ru. In contrast, benefiting from the suppressive SMSI, Ru/TiO2&#8208;H2 achieves a 46&#8208;fold CO2 conversion rate than Ru/TiO2. For Ru/TiO2&#8208;H2, considerable photo&#8208;excited hot electrons from Ru nanoparticles (NPs) migrate to oxygen vacancies (OVs) and facilitate the CO2 activation under illumination, simultaneously leaving an electron&#8208;deficient status of Ru&#948;+ to accelerate CH4 decomposition. Consequently, the photothermal catalysis over Ru/TiO2&#8208;H2 lowers the activation energy and overcomes limitations of a purely thermal system. This work offers a novel strategy for designing efficient photothermal catalysts via regulating two&#8208;phase interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Late&#8208;Stage Modifications Enable Downstream Click&#8208;Mediated Fluorescent Tagging of Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The promiscuity of N1&#8208;tryptophan prenyltransferase AcyF was screened with 22 unnatural pyrophosphates, which exhibited reactive groups suitable for copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition, metathesis, and inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reactions. A 10&#8208;mer tryptophan&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptide was tailored by AcyF, and the resulting modified peptide was successfully labelled with a tetrazine&#8211;fluorescein conjugate by IEDDA.







Abstract
Aromatic prenyltransferases from cyanobactin biosynthetic pathways catalyse the chemoselective and regioselective intramolecular transfer of prenyl/geranyl groups from isoprene donors to an electron&#8208;rich position in these macrocyclic and linear peptides. These enzymes often demonstrate relaxed substrate specificity and are considered useful biocatalysts for structural diversification of peptides. Herein, we assess the isoprene donor specificity of the N1&#8208;tryptophan prenyltransferase AcyF from the anacyclamide A8P pathway using a library of 22 synthetic alkyl pyrophosphate analogues, of which many display reactive groups that are amenable to additional functionalization. We further used AcyF to introduce a reactive moiety into a tryptophan&#8208;containing cyclic peptide and subsequently used click chemistry to fluorescently label the enzymatically modified peptide. This chemoenzymatic strategy allows late&#8208;stage modification of peptides and is useful for many applications.

The [3s,5s]&#8208;sigmatropic shift is a pericyclic reaction that is forbidden according to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules. Density functional theory calculations are used to show that systems utilizing transition&#8208;state complexation to a metal catalyst and strategically placed substituents engaging in key stereoelectronic effects can select for the [3s,5s] process and outcompete both allowed [3s,3s]&#8208; and [3s,5a]&#8208;shifts.

         <title>When It's Heavier: Interfacial and Solvation Chemistry of Isotopes in Aqueous Electrolytes for Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical effect of isotope of water is introduced into a Zn&#8208;ion battery electrolyte to control severe side reactions and massive gas production. Due to the low diffusion and strong coordination of ions in D2O, the possibility of side reaction is decreased, resulting in a broader electrochemically stable potential window, less pH change, less zinc hydroxide sulfate (ZHS) generation and pure phase ZHS precipitation during cycling.







Abstract
The electrochemical effect of isotope (EEI) of water is introduced in the Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) electrolyte to deal with the challenge of severe side reactions and massive gas production. Due to the low diffusion and strong coordination of ions in D2O, the possibility of side reactions is decreased, resulting in a broader electrochemically stable potential window, less pH change, and less zinc hydroxide sulfate (ZHS) generation during cycling. Moreover, we demonstrate that D2O eliminates the different ZHS phases generated by the change of bound water during cycling because of the consistently low local ion and molecule concentration, resulting in a stable interface between the electrode and electrolyte. The full cells with D2O&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrated more stable cycling performance which displayed &#8764;100&#8201;% reversible efficiencies after 1,000 cycles with a wide voltage window of 0.8&#8211;2.0&#8197;V and 3,000 cycles with a normal voltage window of 0.8&#8211;1.9&#8197;V at a current density of 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Alternating Metal&#8208;Ligand Coordination Improves Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction by a Mononuclear Ru Catalyst
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;overpotential mechanistic route is proposed for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. One metal center acts as both Lewis base and Lewis acid at different stages of the catalytic cycle. This ambivalent behavior of the metal along with the flexibility of the ligands allows for the formation of a 5&#8208;membered metallacyclic intermediate by intramolecular cyclization.







Abstract
Molecular electrocatalysts for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion often operate at large overpotentials, due to the large barrier for C&#8722;O bond cleavage. Illustrated with ruthenium polypyridyl catalysts, we herein propose a mechanistic route that involves one metal center that acts as both Lewis base and Lewis acid at different stages of the catalytic cycle, by density functional theory in corroboration with experimental FTIR. The nucleophilic character of the Ru center manifests itself in the initial attack on CO2 to form [Ru&#8208;CO2]0, while its electrophilic character allows for the formation of a 5&#8208;membered metallacyclic intermediate, [Ru&#8208;CO2CO2]0,c, by addition of a second CO2 molecule and intramolecular cyclization. The calculated activation barrier for C&#8722;O bond cleavage via the metallacycle is decreased by 34.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 as compared to the non&#8208;cyclic adduct in the two electron reduced state of complex 1. Such metallacyclic intermediates in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction offer a new design feature that can be implemented consciously in future catalyst designs.

         <title>Direct N&#8722;H Activation to Generate Nitrogen Radical for Arylamine Synthesis via Quantum Dots Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct activation of amine N&#8722;H bonds is realized to provide N&#8208;radicals in a redox&#8208;neutral and site&#8208;selective manner. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation of quantum dots, the N&#8208;radicals are successfully applied to the synthesis of aromatic amines. The high efficiency and broad functional&#8208;group tolerance demonstrate the potential of photocatalytic N&#8208;radicals in the construction of valuable arylamines.







Abstract
Represented herein is the first example of N&#8208;radical generation direct from N&#8722;H bond activation under mild and redox&#8208;neutral conditions. The in situ generated N&#8208;radical intercepts a reduced heteroarylnitrile/aryl halide for C&#8722;N bond formation under visible&#8208;light irradiation of quantum dots (QDs). A series of aryl and alkylamines with heteroarylnitriles/aryl halides exhibit high efficiency, site&#8208;selectivity and good functional&#8208;group tolerance. Moreover, consecutive C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formation using benzylamines as substrates is also achieved, producing N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines with H2 evolution. The redox&#8208;neutral conditions, broad substrate scope, and efficiency of N&#8208;radical formation are advantageous for organic synthesis.

         <title>Alkyne Insertion Enabled Vinyl to Acyl 1,5&#8208;Palladium Migration: Rapid Access to Substituted 5&#8208;Membered&#8208;Dihydrobenzofurans and Indolines</title>

         <dc:description>
We herein report a novel 1,5&#8208;palladium/hydrogen shift pattern between a vinyl and an acyl group, which provides a divergent access to substituted 5&#8208;membered&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans and indolines. Further studies unveiled a novel relayed decarbonylative Catellani&#8208;type reaction. Mechanistic investigations including DFT calculations have shed light on the reaction pathway.







Abstract
&#8220;Through space&#8221; palladium/hydrogen shift is an efficient strategy to achieve selective functionalization of a specific remote C&#8722;H bond. Compared with relatively extensive exploited 1,4&#8208;palladium migration process, the relevant 1,5&#8208;Pd/H shift was far less investigated. We herein report a novel 1,5&#8208;Pd/H shift pattern between a vinyl and an acyl group. Through the pattern, rapid access to 5&#8208;membered&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran and indoline derivatives has been achieved. Further studies have unveiled an unprecedented trifunctionalization (vinylation, alkynylation and amination) of a phenyl ring through 1,5&#8208;palladium migration relayed decarbonylative Catellani type reaction. A series of mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations have provided insights into the reaction pathway. Notably, it was unveiled that the 1,5&#8208;palladium migration in our case prefers a stepwise mechanism involving a PdIV intermediate.

         <title>Chemoselective 1,2&#8208;Reduction and Regiodivergent Deuteration of Chromium&#8208;Bound Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient protocol for chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;reduction of arenes via &#951;6&#8208;coordination to chromium has been reported for the first time. The versatility of this strategy further leads to a regiodivergent reductive deuteration that enables precise control of the deuteration sites as well as the degrees of deuterium incorporation.







Abstract
Herein, a general strategy for chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;reduction of chromium&#8208;bound arenes was developed, thus providing rapid access to 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes. Selective arene activation via &#960;&#8208;complexation along with the use of mild hydride Ph3SiH can overcome the inherently low reactivity of arene &#960;&#8208;bonds while tolerating various reduction&#8208;sensitive functional groups. Its versatility further enables a regiodivergent deuteration. Using different sequences of (non)deuterated hydride and acid reagents, the deuterated positions as well as the degrees of deuterium incorporation can be controlled precisely, which leads to a large and previously inaccessible chemical space for 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene isotopologues. A reasonable mechanism was proposed based on intermediate capture and control experiments. The synthetic value of this selective 1,2&#8208;reduction was demonstrated in the formal total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;galanthamine and (&#177;)&#8208;lycoramine.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Nanobeacons Redirect Innate Immune Killing towards Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly imprinted nanobeacons (MINBs) were developed for redirecting innate immune killing towards cancer. The MINBs target the cancer cells and provide navigation for recruiting hapten&#8208;specific antibodies. The recruited antibodies further gather natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages, triggering specific antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody&#8208;dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) to kill the tagged cancer cells.







Abstract
Harnessing innate immunity is an appealing strategy for cancer treatment. Herein, we report a new strategy called molecularly imprinted nanobeacons (MINBs) for redirecting innate immune killing towards triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC). The MINBs were molecularly imprinted nanoparticles with the N&#8208;epitope of glycoprotein nonmetastatic B (GPNMB) as the template and grafted with plentiful fluorescein moieties as the hapten. The MINBs could tag the TNBC cells via binding with GPNMB and thereby provide navigation for recruiting hapten&#8208;specific antibodies. The gathered antibodies could further trigger effective Fc&#8208;domain&#8208;mediated immune killing towards the tagged cancer cells. In vivo experiments showed that the TNBC growth was significantly inhibited after MINBs treatment by intravenous injection as compared with control groups. This study not only opens a new access for redirecting innate immunity towards TNBC but also paves the way for innate immunity&#8208;based therapy of other diseases.

&lt;p&gt;Molecularly imprinted nanobeacons (MINBs) were developed for redirecting innate immune killing towards cancer. The MINBs target the cancer cells and provide navigation for recruiting hapten-specific antibodies. The recruited antibodies further gather natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages, triggering specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) to kill the tagged cancer cells.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Isolated Tin(IV) Active Sites for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 to CH4 in Neutral Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;based catalysts are known for their high yield of formate or CO in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, but here we report for the first time that a new Sn&#8208;based catalyst can achieve exceptional partial current density for the CH4 product.







Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts with non&#8208;copper metal sites for electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (eCO2RR) to hydrocarbons and oxygenates is highly desirable, but still a great challenge. Herein, a stable metal&#8211;organic framework (DMA)4[Sn2(THO)2] (Sn&#8208;THO, THO6&#8722; = triphenylene&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexakis(olate), DMA = dimethylammonium) with isolated and distorted octahedral SnO62&#8722; active sites is reported as an electrocatalyst for eCO2RR, showing an exceptional performance for eCO2RR to the CH4 product rather than the common products formate and CO for reported Sn&#8208;based catalysts. The partial current density of CH4 reaches a high value of 34.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing most reported copper&#8208;based and all non&#8208;Cu metal&#8208;based catalysts. Our experimental and theoretical results revealed that the isolated SnO62&#8722; active site favors the formation of key *OCOH species to produce CH4 and can greatly inhibit the formation of *OCHO and *COOH species to produce *HCOOH and *CO, respectively.

         <title>Supercritical CO2&#8208;Induced Amorphization in 2D Materials: Mechanism and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent achievements in the fabrication of amorphous nanomaterials with the assistance of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2) and discusses the underlying amorphization mechanism. The application of amorphous nanomaterials in different fields is summarized, thus demonstrating the prospects of SC CO2.







Abstract
Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2)&#8208;assisted chemical and material processing has shown great success in the fabrication of 2D amorphous materials, while the amorphization mechanism in SC CO2 is quite complicated to be understand. In this review, we introduce different kinds of 2D amorphous materials prepared with SC CO2 and discuss the possible amorphization mechanism and how they affect the structures and properties of 2D materials. Their applications are further presented and discussed. In addition, the prospective of future development of SC CO2&#8208;assisted fabrication of 2D amorphous materials is also involved. The investigation of SC CO2 induced amorphization not only provides theoretic understanding of amorphization process, but also directs to the preparation and application of 2D amorphous materials with specific structure and property, suggesting the promising future of SC CO2&#8208;assisted process in material design and engineering.

         <title>Reversible Live&#8208;Cell Labeling with Retro&#8208;engineered HaloTags Enables Long&#8208;Term High&#8208; and Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Retro&#8208;engineered HaloTag (reHaloTags) show substrate exchange in the seconds&#8208;to&#8208;minutes regime due to their restored dehalogenase activity. Using fluorogenic substrates, reHaloTags outperform the standard HaloTag7 in bleaching resistance and control of labeling density. Single molecule tracking and localization microscopy particularly benefits from these new tags, opening exciting possibilities for untangling protein dynamics over extended time.







Abstract
Self&#8208;labeling enzymes (SLE) such as the HaloTag have emerged as powerful tools in high and super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy. Newly developed fluorogenic SLE substrates enable imaging in the presence of excess dye. To exploit this feature for reversible labeling, we engineered two variants of HaloTag7 with restored dehalogenase activity. Kinetic studies in vitro showed different turnover kinetics for reHaloTagS (&#8776;0.006&#8197;s&#8722;1) and reHaloTagF (&#8776;0.055&#8197;s&#8722;1). Imaging by confocal and stimulated emission depletion microscopy yielded 3&#8208;5&#8208;time enhanced photostability of reHaloTag labeling. Prominently, single molecule imaging with reHaloTags enabled controlled and stable labeling density over extended time periods. By combination with structured illumination, simultaneous visualization of single molecule diffusion and organellar dynamics was achieved. These applications highlight the potential of reHaloTag labeling for pushing the limits of advanced fluorescence microscopy techniques.

         <title>Square&#8208;Planar Anionic Pt0 Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a diphosphine&#8208;borane ligand DPB enables straightforward access to anionic Pt0 complexes. [(DPB)PtX]&#8722; complexes were isolated and fully characterized. They represent unique examples of square&#8208;planar Pt0 complexes, as substantiated by X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and DFT calculations.







Abstract
A T&#8208;shaped Pt0 complex with a diphosphine&#8208;borane (DPB) ligand was prepared. The Pt&#8594;B interaction enhances the electrophilicity of the metal and triggers the addition of Lewis bases to give the corresponding tetracoordinate complexes. For the first time, anionic Pt0 complexes are isolated and structurally authenticated. X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses show the anionic complexes [(DPB)PtX]&#8722; (X=CN, Cl, Br, I) to be square&#8208;planar. The d10 configuration and Pt0 oxidation state of the metal were unambiguously established by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The coordination of Lewis acids as Z&#8208;type ligands is a powerful mean to stabilize elusive electron&#8208;rich metal complexes and achieve uncommon geometry.

         <title>Sn Anodes Protected by Intermetallic FeSn2 Layers for Long&#8208;lifespan Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries with High Initial Coulombic Efficiency of 93.8 %</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intermetallic FeSn2 layer alleviates the huge volume change and prevents the coarsening of Sn anodes to provide a high ICE of 93.8&#8201;% and long life for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
With a theoretical capacity of 847&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, Sn has emerged as promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, enormous volume expansion and agglomeration of nano Sn lead to low Coulombic efficiency and poor cycling stability. Herein, an intermetallic FeSn2 layer is designed via thermal reduction of polymer&#8208;Fe2O3 coated hollow SnO2 spheres to construct a yolk&#8208;shell structured Sn/FeSn2@C. The FeSn2 layer can relieve internal stress, avoid the agglomeration of Sn to accelerate the Na+ transport, and enable fast electronic conduction, which endows quick electrochemical dynamics and long&#8208;term stability. As a result, the Sn/FeSn2@C anode exhibits high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE=93.8&#8201;%) and a high reversible capacity of 409&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1500&#8197;cycles, corresponding to an 80&#8201;% capacity retention. In addition, NVP//Sn/FeSn2@C sodium&#8208;ion full cell shows outstanding cycle stability (capacity retaining rate of 89.7&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C).

     alt="Sn Anodes Protected by Intermetallic FeSn2 Layers for Long-lifespan Sodium-ion Batteries with High Initial Coulombic Efficiency of 93.8 %"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intermetallic FeSn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer alleviates the huge volume change and prevents the coarsening of Sn anodes to provide a high ICE of 93.8&#8201;% and long life for sodium-ion batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a theoretical capacity of 847&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, Sn has emerged as promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, enormous volume expansion and agglomeration of nano Sn lead to low Coulombic efficiency and poor cycling stability. Herein, an intermetallic FeSn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer is designed via thermal reduction of polymer-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; coated hollow SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; spheres to construct a yolk-shell structured Sn/FeSn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@C. The FeSn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer can relieve internal stress, avoid the agglomeration of Sn to accelerate the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport, and enable fast electronic conduction, which endows quick electrochemical dynamics and long-term stability. As a result, the Sn/FeSn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@C anode exhibits high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE=93.8&#8201;%) and a high reversible capacity of 409&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1500&#8197;cycles, corresponding to an 80&#8201;% capacity retention. In addition, NVP//Sn/FeSn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@C sodium-ion full cell shows outstanding cycle stability (capacity retaining rate of 89.7&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Switching Quantum Interference in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions by Mechanical Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The charge transport through single&#8208;molecule electronic devices can be controlled mechanically by changing the molecular geometrical configuration in situ, but the tunable conductance range is typically less than two orders of magnitude. Herein, we proposed a new mechanical tuning strategy to control the charge transport through the single&#8208;molecule junctions via switching quantum interference patterns. By designing molecules with multiple anchoring groups, we switched the electron transport between the constructive quantum interference (CQI) pathway and the destructive quantum interference (DQI) pathway, and more than four orders of magnitude conductance variation can be achieved by shifting the electrodes in a range of about 0.6 nm, which is the highest conductance range ever achieved using mechanical tuning.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The carbon to CaC2 route is promising to provide a sustainable elementary unit, C2H2, for the organic synthesis industry, but the traditional thermal reaction process suffers from low carbon efficiency, harmful gas contamination, high temperature operation, and risky CO management. We herein report a high carbon efficiency (ca. 100%) conversion of biochar to C2H2 through an electrolytic synthesis of solid CaC2 in molten CaCl2/KCl/CaO at 973 K. The main reactions are carbon reduction to CaC2 at the solid carbon cathode and oxygen evolution at an inert anode. Meanwhile, the electrolysis removes S and P from the solid cathode, avoiding the formation of CaS and Ca3P2 in CaC2 and consequently eliminating H2S and PH3 contamination in the finally produced C2H2.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Li Plating on Graphite Anodes through Electrolyte Engineering for Fast&#8208;Charging Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The difficulties to identify the rate&#8208;limiting step cause the lithium (Li) plating hard to be completely avoided on graphite anodes during fast charging. Therefore, Li plating regulation and morphology control are proposed to address this issue. Specifically, a Li plating&#8208;reversible graphite anode is achieved via a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to successfully regulate the Li plating with high reversibility over high&#8208;rate cycling. The evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) before and after Li plating is deeply investigated to explore the interaction between the lithiation behavior and electrochemical interface polarization. Under the fact that Li plating contributes 40% of total lithiation capacity, the stable LiF&#8208;rich SEI renders the anode a higher average Coulombic efficiency (99.9%) throughout 240 cycles and a 99.95% reversibility of Li plating. Consequently, a self&#8208;made 1.2&#8208;Ah LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 | graphite pouch cell delivers a competitive retention of 84.4% even at 7.2 A (6 C) after 150 cycles. This work creates an ingenious bridge between the graphite anode and Li plating, for realizing the high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>An Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Protein Desulfurization Method Reminiscent of Aquatic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One pillar of protein chemical synthesis based on the application of ligation chemistries to cysteine is the group of reactions enabling the selective desulfurization of cysteine residues into alanines. Modern desulfurization reactions use a phosphine as a sink for sulfur under activation conditions involving the generation of sulfur&#8208;centered radicals. Here we show that cysteine desulfurization by a phosphine can be effected efficiently by micromolar concentrations of iron under aerobic conditions in hydrogen carbonate buffer, that is using conditions that are reminiscent of iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation phenomena occurring in natural waters. Therefore, our work shows that chemical processes taking place in aquatic systems can be adapted to a chemical reactor for triggering a complex chemoselective transformation at the protein level, while minimizing the resort to harmful chemicals.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Conventional nanozymes often possess low active site density. Pursuing effective strategies for constructing highly active single&#8208;atomic nanosystems with maximum atom utilization efficiency is exceptionally attractive. Herein, we develop a facile &#8220;missing&#8208;linker&#8208;confined coordination&#8221; strategy to fabricate two self&#8208;assembled nanozymes, i.e., conventional nanozyme (NE) and single&#8208;atomic nanozyme (SAE), which respectively consist of Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms as active catalytic sites anchored in metal&#8208;organic frameworks with encapsulated photosensitizers for catalase&#8208;mimicking enhanced photodynamic therapy. Compared to Pt nanoparticle&#8208;based conventional nanozyme, Pt single&#8208;atomic nanozyme shows enhanced catalase&#8208;mimicking activity in generating oxygen for overcoming tumor hypoxia, thus presenting more efficient reactive oxygen species generation and high tumor inhibition rate.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carboamination reaction is one of the most significant transformations in organic chemistry. Herein, we report the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alleneamination of &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones with propargylic acetates. This protocol enables the efficient installation of various multisubstituted allene groups onto enantioenriched dihydropyrazoles in good yields (up to 96%) with up to 96% ee. The chiral sulfinamide phosphine ligand Xu&#8208;5 is responsible for high effciency and good enantioselectivity. The salient features of this reaction include the readily available starting materials, a broad substrate scope, an easy scale&#8208;up, mild reaction conditions and versatile transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Determining the Role of Ion Transport Throughput in Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are promising candidates for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage devices. However, there still lacks an evaluation criterion to estimate real research status and compare overall performance&#160;of the developed SSLMBs. Herein, we propose a comprehensive descriptor, Li+ transport throughput (&#934;Li+), to estimate actual conditions and output performances of the SSLMBs. The &#934;Li+ is defined as molar number of Li+ passing through unit area of electrode/electrolyte interface in an hour (mol m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1), which is a quantizable value after taking complex aspects including cycle rate, electrode areal capacity and polarization into account. On this basis, we evaluate the &#934;Li+ of liquid, quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state and solid&#8208;state batteries, and highlight three key aspects to achieve high value of &#934;Li+ via building highly efficient cross&#8208;phase, cross&#8208;gap and cross&#8208;interface ion transport in the solid&#8208;state battery systems. We believe the new concept of&#160;&#934;Li+&#160;provides milestone guidelines towards large&#8208;scale commercialization of SSLMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Conjugation with Triazolinediones as a Route to Degradable Poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;Lipids for mRNA Lipid Nanoparticle Formulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is considered as the gold standard for colloidal stabilization of nanomedicines and prolonging the half&#8208;life of proteins. However, PEG is non&#8208;degradable and lacks functionality in the backbone, thereby limiting the scope of its potential. Herein, we introduced concomitantly functionality and degradability onto the PEG backbone by reacting PEG with 1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones (TADs) derivatives under visible light irradiation. The TAD&#8208;PEG conjugates were degradable in aqueous medium under physiological conditions, with the rate of hydrolysis depending on the pH and temperature of the medium. Next, a PEG&#8208;lipid was modified with TAD&#8208;derivatives. The obtained TAD&#8208;PEG&#8208;lipids could be successfully used for mRNA lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery and increased mRNA transfection efficiency on multiple cell cultures in vitro, without increasing cellular uptake of LNPs. In vivo, in mice, mRNA LNP formulation exhibited a similar tissue distribution as common LNPs, with a slight decrease in transfection efficiency. Our findings pave the road towards the design of degradable, backbone&#8208;functionalized PEG for applications in nanomedicine and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Redox in Polyimide:&#8201; Witness by In Situ Electron Paramagnetic Resonance in Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic materials are promising candidates for future rechargeable batteries, owing to their high natural abundance and rapidly redox reaction. Elaborating the charge/discharge process of organic electrode is critical to unveil the fundamental redox mechanism of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but monitoring of this process is still challenging. Here, we report a nondestructive electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique to real&#8208;time detect the electron migration step within polyimide cathode. From in situ EPR tests, we vividly observe a classical redox reaction along with two&#8208;electron transfer which only shows one pair of peaks in the cyclic voltammetry curve. The radical anion and dianion intermediates are detailed delineation at redox sites in EPR spectra, which can be further confirmed through density functional theory calculations. This approach is especially crucial to elaborate the correlation behind electrochemical and molecular structure for multistep organic&#8208;based LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Science&#8208;Driven Atomistic Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Machine learning (ML) algorithms are currently emerging as powerful tools in all areas of science. Conventionally, ML is understood as a fundamentally data&#8208;driven endeavour. Unfortunately, large well&#8208;curated databases are sparse in chemistry. In this contribution, I therefore review science&#8208;driven ML approaches which do not rely on ``big data'', focusing on the atomistic modelling of materials and molecules. In this context, the term science&#8208;driven refers to approaches that begin with a scientific question and then ask what training data and model design choices are appropriate. As key features of science&#8208;driven ML, the automated and purpose&#8208;driven collection of data and the use of chemical and physical priors to achieve high data&#8208;efficiency are discussed. Furthermore, the importance of appropriate model evaluation and error estimation is emphasized.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Supported Copper Photoredox Catalysts for Iminyl Radical&#8208;Mediated Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light copper photocatalysis has recently emerged as a viable technology for building sustainable synthetic processes. To broaden the applications of phosphine&#8208;ligated copper(I) complexes, we describe herein an effective metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;supported copper(I) photocatalyst for multiple iminyl radical&#8208;mediated reactions. Due to site isolation, the heterogenized copper photosensitizer has a significantly higher catalytic activity than its homogeneous counterpart. Using a hydroxamic acid linker to immobilize copper species on MOF supports affords the heterogeneous catalysts with high recyclability. The post&#8208;synthetic modification sequence on MOF surfaces allows for the preparation of previously unavailable monomeric copper species. Our findings highlight the potential of using MOF&#8208;based heterogeneous catalytic systems to address fundamental challenges in the development of synthetic methodologies and mechanistic investigations of transition&#8208;metal photoredox catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Deformation of Soft Nanogel Particles Generates Artificial Biominerals with Ordered Internal Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biominerals can exhibit exceptional mechanical properties owing to their hierarchically&#8208;ordered organic/inorganic nanocomposite structure. However, synthetic routes to oriented artificial biominerals of comparable complexity remain a formidable technical challenge. Herein we design a series of soft, deformable nanogels that are employed as particulate additives to prepare nanogel@calcite nanocomposite crystals. Remarkably, such nanogels undergo a significant morphological change&#8212;from spherical to pseudo&#8208;hemispherical&#8212;depending on their degree of cross&#8208;linking. Such deformation occurs normal to the direction of growth of the (104) face of the calcite and the underlying occlusion mechanism is revealed by in situ atomic force microscopy studies. This model system provides new mechanistic insights regarding the formation of oriented structures during biomineralization and offers new avenues for the design of synthetic nanocomposites comprising aligned anisotropic nanoparticles.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Supramolecular Multiblock Copolymerization Accompanying Chirality Transfer in Heterostructures via Living Chain Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the unique synthesis of chiral supramolecular tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;BCPs with controllable chirality using kinetically adjusted seeded supramolecular copolymerization in THF and DMSO (99:1, v/v). Tetraphenylethylene (D&#8208; and L&#8208;TPE) derivatives bearing D&#8208; and L&#8208;alanine side chains formed thermodynamically favored chiral products via a kinetically trapped in monomeric state with a long lag phase. In contrast, achiral TPE&#8208;G containing glycine moieties did not form a supramolecular polymer owing to the energy barrier in its kinetically trapped state. We show that the copolymerization of the metastable states of TPE&#8208;G not only enables the generation of supramolecular BCPs by the seeded living growth method, but also transfers chirality at the seed ends. This research demonstrates the generation of chiral supramolecular tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;BCPs with B&#8208;A&#8208;B, A&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;A, and C&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;C block patterns accompanying chirality transfer via seeded living polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Methane photooxidation with nearly 100% selectivity towards oxygenates: proton rebound ensures the regeneration of methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Restrained by uncontrollable dehydrogenation process, the target products of methane direct conversion would suffer from an inevitable overoxidation, which is deemed as one of the most challenging issues in catalysis. Herein, based on the concept of hydrogen bonding trap, we proposed a novel concept to modulate methane conversion pathway to hinder the overoxidation of target products. Taking boron nitride as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept model, for the first time, it is found that the designed N&#8208;H bonds can work as hydrogen bonding trap to attract electrons. Benefitting from it, the N&#8208;H bonds on the BN surface rather than C&#8208;H bonds in formaldehyde prefer to cleavage, greatly suppressing the continuous dehydrogenation process. More importantly, formaldehyde will combine with the released protons, which leads to a proton rebound process to regenerate methanol. As a result, BN shows a high methane conversion rate (8.5%) and nearly 100% product selectivity to oxygenates under atmospheric pressure.</dc:description>

         <title>Reticular Chemistry&#8208;Enabled Sonodynamic Activity of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Nanodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of covalent organic framework (COF) sonosensitizers with intrinsic sonodynamic effects is highly desirable. However, such COFs are generally constructed using small&#8208;molecule photosensitizers. Herein, we report that the reticular chemistry&#8208;based synthesis of COFs from two inert monomers yields a COF&#8208;based sonosensitizer (TPE&#8208;NN) with inherent sonodynamic activity. Subsequently, a nanoscale COF TPE&#8208;NN is fabricated and embedded with copper (Cu)&#8208;coordinated sites to obtain TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu. Results show that Cu coordination can enhance the sonodynamic effect of TPE&#8208;NN, whereas ultrasound (US) irradiation for sonodynamic therapy can augment the chemodynamic efficacy of TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu. Consequently, TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu upon US irradiation shows high&#8208;performance anticancer effects based on mutually reinforced sono&#8208;/chemo&#8208;nanodynamic therapy. This study reveals the backbone&#8208;originated sonodynamic activity of COFs and proposes a paradigm of intrinsic COF sonosensitizers for nanodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Pauson&#8208;Khand Reactions of 1,6&#8208;Chloroenynes with 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enantioselective rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction (PKR) using 1,6&#8208;chloroenynes that contain challenging 1,1&#8208;disubstituted olefins is described. In contrast to the previous studies with these types of substrates, which is only suitable for a single type of tether and alkyne substituent, the new approach results in a more expansive substrate scope, including carbon and heteroatom tethers with polar and non&#8208;polar substituents on the alkene. DFT calculations provide critical insight into the role of the halide, which pre&#8208;polarizes the alkyne to lower the barrier for the metallacycle formation and provides the proper steric profile to promote a favorable enantiodetermining interaction between substrate and chiral diphosphine ligand. Hence, the chloroalkyne enables the efficient and enantioselective PKR with 1,6&#8208;enynes that contain challenging 1,1&#8208;disubstituted olefins, which represents a new paradigm for enantioselective reactions involving 1,6&#8208;enynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Potassium Metal &#8211; Support Interactions on Dendrite Growth</title>

         <dc:description>Combined synchrotron X&#8208;ray nanotomography imaging, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) and modeling elucidate how potassium (K) metal &#8208; support energetics influence&#160;electrodeposit microstructure. Three model supports are employed: O&#8208;functionalized carbon cloth (potassiophilic, fully&#8208;wetted), non&#8208;functionalized cloth and Cu foil (potassiophobic, nonwetted). Nanotomography and focused ion beam (cryo&#8208;FIB) cross&#8208;sections yield complementary three&#8208;dimensional (3D) maps of cycled electrodeposits. Electrodeposit on potassiophobic support is a triphasic sponge, with fibrous dendrites covered by solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and interspersed with nanopores (sub&#8208;10 nm to 100 nm scale). Lage cracks and voids are also a key feature. On potassiophilic support, the deposit is dense and pore&#8208;free, with uniform surface and SEI morphology. Mesoscale modeling captures the critical role of substrate&#8208;metal interaction on K metal film nucleation and growth, as well as the associated stress state.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymerized thermally activated delayed fluorescence small molecules: long&#8208;axis polymerization leads to a nearly concentration&#8208;independent luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nowadays numerous thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers have been developed for PLEDs to realize high device performance and tunable emission colors. However, they often possess a strong concentration dependence on their luminescence including aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). Herein, we first report a nearly concentration&#8208;independent TADF polymer based on the strategy of polymerized TADF small molecules. It is found that when a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) type TADF small molecule is polymerized through its long&#8208;axis direction, the triplet state is distributed along the polymeric backbone to effectively suppress the unwanted concentration quenching. Unlike the short&#8208;axis one with an ACQ effect, the photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of the resultant long&#8208;axis polymer remains almost unchanged with the increasing doping concentration. Accordingly, a promising external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 20% is successfully achieved in a whole doping control window of 5&#8208;100 wt.%.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of an A6L6 Anion Trigonal Antiprism and Binding of Glucopyranosides and Polyethylene Glycols (PEGs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) has proven to be a very effective strategy in the construction of polyhedral structures. Here we demonstrate that variation of the &#8220;angle&#8221; of the backbone of C3&#8208;symmetric tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands, from triphenylamine to triphenylphosphine oxide, results in the change of the final construct from A4L4 tetrahedron to a higher&#8208;nuclearity, A6L6 trigonal antiprism (A = anion, herein PO43&#8211;; L = ligand). Most interestingly, this assembly features a huge hollow internal space that is divided into three compartments, one central cavity and two large outer pockets. This multi&#8208;cavity character enables the binding of different guests, i.e. monosaccharides or polyethylene glycol molecules (PEG600, PEG1000 and PEG2000), respectively. The results prove that anion coordination by multiple hydrogen bonds may provide both sufficient strength and flexibility, thus making possible the formation of complicated structures with adaptive guest binding ability.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance and Self&#8208;Powered X&#8208;Ray Detectors Made of Smooth Perovskite Microcrystalline Films with 100&#8208;&#956;m Grains</title>

         <dc:description>Perovskite single crystals and polycrystalline films have complementary merits and deficiencies in X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. Herein, we report preparation of dense and smooth perovskite microcrystalline films with both merits of single crystals and polycrystalline films through polycrystal&#8208;induced growth and hot&#8208;pressing treatment (HPT). Utilizing polycrystalline films as seeds, multi&#8208;inch&#8208;sized microcrystalline films can be in&#8208;situ grown on diverse substrates with maximum grain size reaching 100 &#956;m, which endows the microcrystalline films with comparable carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime (&#956;&#964;) product as single crystals. As a result, self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detectors with impressive sensitivity of 6.1 &#215; 104 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and low detection limit of 1.5 nGyair s&#8722;1 are achieved, leading to high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray imaging at an ultra&#8208;low dose rate of 67 nGyair s&#8722;1. Combining with the fast response speed (186 &#956;s), this work may contribute to the development of perovskite&#8208;based low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Selective Oxidation of Ethylene to Ethylene Glycol Assisted by In&#8208;situ Generated H2O2 from O2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethylene glycol is a useful organic compound and chemical intermediate for manufacturing various commodity chemicals of industrial importance. Nevertheless, the production of ethylene glycol in a green and safe manner is still a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we established an integrated, efficient pathway for oxidizing ethylene into ethylene glycol. Mesoporous carbon catalyst produces H2O2, and titanium silicalite&#8208;1&#160;catalyst would subsequently oxidize ethylene into ethylene glycol with the in&#8208;situ generated H2O2. This tandem route presents a remarkable activity, i.e., 86% H2O2&#160;conversion with 99% ethylene glycol selectivity and 51.48 mmol gecat&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1&#160;production rate at 0.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. Apart from generated H2O2&#160;as an oxidant, there exists &#8226;OOH intermediate which could omit the step of absorbing and dissociating H2O2&#160;over titanium silicalite&#8208;1, showing faster reaction kinetics compared to the ex&#8208;situ one. This work not only provides a new idea for yielding ethylene glycol but also demonstrates the superior of in&#8208;situ generated H2O2&#160;in tandem route.</dc:description>

         <title>Exceptionally Stable Dimers and Trimers of Au25 Clusters Linked with a Bidentate Dithiol: Synthesis, Structure and Chirality Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chiral dithiol is used to bridge Au25 nanoclusters together. Due to its bidentate nature, the dimers and trimers can be isolated before further reaction occurs. The structure of the oligomers is analysed by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. The changes in optical properties are followed by UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism.







Abstract
A bidentate chiral dithiol (diBINAS) is utilised to bridge Au25 nanoclusters to form oligomers. Separation by size allows the isolation of fractions that are stable thanks to the bidentate nature of the linker. The structure of the products is elucidated by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and calculated using density functional theory. Additional structural details are studied by diffusion&#8208;ordered nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. Significant changes in the optical properties are analysed by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopies, with the latter demonstrating a strong emission enhancement. Furthermore, the emergent chiral characteristics are studied by circular dichroism. Due to the geometry constraints of the nanocluster assemblies, diBINAS can be regarded as a templating molecule, taking a step towards the directed self&#8208;assembly of metal clusters.

         <title>Regulating the Synergistic Effect in Bimetallic Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalysts by Adjusting the Coupling Strength Between Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bimetallic Co&#8722;Ni two&#8208;dimensional polymer model oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst with well&#8208;defined architecture, monolayer characteristic, different metal center spacing or different conjugation degree of bridge skeleton were designed and synthesized to explore the influence of the coupling strength between metal centers for OER.







Abstract
Bimetallic electrocatalysts with its superior performance has a broad application prospect in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the fundamental understanding of the mechanism of synergistic effect is still limited since there lacks a practical way to decouple the influence factors on the intrinsic activity of active sites from others. Herein, a series of bimetallic Co&#8722;Ni two&#8208;dimensional polymer (2DP) model OER catalysts with well&#8208;defined architecture, monolayer characteristic, were designed and synthesized to explore the influence of the coupling strength between metal centers on OER performance. The coupling strength was regulated by adjusting the spacing between metal centers or the conjugation degree of bridge skeleton. Among the examined 2DPs, CoTAPP&#8208;Ni&#8208;MF&#8208;2DP, which has the strongest coupling strength between metal centers exhibited the best OER performance. These model systems can help to explore the precise structure&#8208;performance relationships, which is important for the rational catalyst design at the atomic/molecular levels.

         <title>Double Deprotonation of CH3CN by an Iron&#8208;Aluminium Complex
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The double deprotonation of CH3CN was achieved using an iron&#8208;aluminium complex, yielding products containing a simple yet rare [HC=C=N]2&#8722; dianion, characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography. DFT calculations suggest that the mechanism proceeds via a stepwise double deprotonation of the substrate by two equivalents of the bimetallic complex, with the intermediacy of a [NCCH2]&#8722; anion, which was observed spectroscopically in situ.







Abstract
Herein we present the first double deprotonation of acetonitrile (CH3CN) using two equivalents of a bimetallic iron&#8208;aluminium complex. The products of this reaction contain an exceeding simple yet rare [CHCN]2&#8722; dianion moiety that bridges two metal fragments. DFT calculations suggest that the bonding to the metal centres occurs through heavily polarised covalent interactions. Mechanistic studies reveal the intermediacy of a monomeric [CH2CN]&#8722; complex, which has been characterised in situ. Our findings provide an important example in which a bimetallic metal complex achieves a new type of reactivity not previously encountered with monometallic counterparts.[1,&#8201;2] The isolation of a [CHCN]2&#8722; dianion through simple deprotonation of CH3CN also offers the possibility of establishing a broader chemistry of this motif.

Sulfone&#8208;embedded heterocyclics are of great interest in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), however, exploring highly efficient narrowband emitters based on sulfone&#8208;embedded heterocyclics remains challenging. Herein, five emitters with different sulfur valence state and molecular rigidity, namely tP, tCPD, 2tCPD, tPD and tPT, are thoroughly analysed. With restricted twisting of flexible peripheral phenyl by strengthening molecular rigidity, molecular emission spectra can be enormously narrowed. Further, introducing the sulfone group with bending vibration in low&#8208;frequency region that suppresses high&#8208;frequency vibration, sharp narrow full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum of 28 and 25&#8197;nm are achieved for 2tCPD and tPD, respectively. Maximum external quantum efficiencies of 22.0&#8201;% and 27.1&#8201;% are successfully realized for 2tCPD&#8208; and tPD&#8208;based OLED devices. These results offer a novel design strategy for constructing narrowband emitters by introducing sulfone group into a rigid molecular framework.

         <title>Liquid Precursor&#8208;Guided Phase Engineering of Single&#8208;Crystal VO2 Beams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates the implications of liquid V2O5 precursor on the liquid&#8208;assisted growth of VO2 and further phase engineering of single&#8208;crystal VO2 beams between the M1&#8208;, M2&#8208;, and T&#8208;phases by manipulation of oxygen stoichiometry, enabling various multiphase structures in single VO2 beams and enriching the deformation modes for their actuation applications.







Abstract
The study of VO2 flourishes due to its rich competing phases induced by slight stoichiometry variations. However, the vague mechanism of stoichiometry manipulation makes the precise phase engineering of VO2 still challenging. Here, stoichiometry manipulation of single&#8208;crystal VO2 beams in liquid&#8208;assisted growth is systematically studied. Contrary to previous experience, oxygen&#8208;rich VO2 phases are abnormally synthesized under a reduced oxygen concentration, revealing the important function of liquid V2O5 precursor: It submerges VO2 crystals and stabilizes their stoichiometric phase (M1) by isolating them from the reactive atmosphere, while the uncovered crystals are oxidized by the growth atmosphere. By varying the thickness of liquid V2O5 precursor and thus the exposure time of VO2 to the atmosphere, various VO2 phases (M1, T, and M2) can be selectively stabilized. Furthermore, this liquid precursor&#8208;guided growth can be used to spatially manages multiphase structures in single VO2 beams, enriching their deformation modes for actuation applications.

         <title>Pore &#8220;Softening&#8221; and Emergence of Breathability Effects of New Keplerate Nano&#8208;Containers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering of porosity for the controlled interaction with their external chemical environment of new members of Keplerate type molecular nano&#8208;containers is investigated. Their crystal structure has been determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions while the balancing act of kinetic and thermodynamic factors in conjunction with the emergence of amplified pore breathability that govern the functionality of the nano&#8208;containers is discussed.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of porous molecular nanocapsules offer unique opportunities to investigate a range of interesting phenomena and applications. However, to design nanocapsules with pre&#8208;defined properties, thorough understanding of their structure&#8208;property relation is required. Here, we report the self&#8208;assembly of two elusive members of the Keplerate family, [Mo132Se60O312(H2O)72(AcO)30]42&#8722; {Mo132Se60} 1 and [W72Mo60Se60O312(H2O)72(AcO)30]42&#8722; {W72Mo60Se60} 2, that have been synthesised using pentagonal and dimeric ([Mo2O2Se2]2+) building blocks and their structures have been confirmed via single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions. Our comparative study involving the uptake of organic ions and the related ligand exchange of various ligand sizes by the {Mo132Se60} and previously reported Keplerates {Mo132O60}, {Mo132S60} based on the ligand exchange rates, revealed the emergence of increased &#8220;breathability&#8221; that dominates over the pore size as we transition from the {Mo132S60} to the &#8220;softer&#8221; {Mo132Se60} molecular nano&#8208;container.

         <title>Multiplex Identification of Post&#8208;Translational Modifications at Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care by Deep Learning&#8208;Assisted Hydrogel Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep learning&#8208;assisted multiplex detection method based on photonic crystal hydrogels for both peptides, cellular proteins and upregulation of phosphorylation in live mammalian cells, is reported. It is the first intelligent naked&#8208;eye strategy for multiplex identification of common PTMs, with high selectivity and sensitivity.







Abstract
Multiplex detection of protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs), especially at point&#8208;of&#8208;care, is of great significance in cancer diagnosis. Herein, we report a machine learning&#8208;assisted photonic crystal hydrogel (PCH) sensor for multiplex detection of PTMs. With closely&#8208;related PCH sensors microfabricated on a single chip, our design achieved not only rapid screening of PTMs at specific protein sites by using only naked eyes/cellphone, but also the feasibility of real&#8208;time monitoring of phosphorylation reactions. By taking advantage of multiplex sensor chips and a neural network algorithm, accurate prediction of PTMs by both their types and concentrations was enabled. This approach was ultimately used to detect and differentiate up/down regulation of different phosphorylation sites within the same protein in live mammalian cells. Our developed method thus holds potential for POC identification of various PTMs in early&#8208;stage diagnosis of protein&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Functional Ionic Liquid Polymer Stabilizer for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic&#8208;liquid polymer additive (poly[Se&#8208;MI][BF4]) is developed to stabilize perovskite precursor inks used to fabricate perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). A chemical homogeneity of the inks contributes to improving the quality of perovskite films by stabilizing the colloids and compositions for over two months. Moreover, polymers anchored at the grain boundaries can further suppress the migration of I&#8722; ions. Thus, the pero&#8208;SCs exhibit overall improved stability and efficiency.







Abstract
The stability&#8208;related issues arising from the perovskite precursor inks, films, device structures and interdependence remain severely under&#8208;explored to date. Herein, we designed an ionic&#8208;liquid polymer (poly[Se&#8208;MI][BF4]), containing functional moieties like carbonyl (C=O), selenium (Se+), and tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8722;) ions, to stabilize the whole device fabrication process. The C=O and Se+ can coordinate with lead and iodine (I&#8722;) ions to stabilize lead polyhalide colloids and the compositions of the perovskite precursor inks for over two months. The Se+ anchored on grain boundaries and the defects passivated by BF4&#8722; efficiently suppress the dissociation and migration of I&#8722; in perovskite films. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of poly[Se&#8208;MI][BF4], high efficiencies of 25.10&#8201;% and 20.85&#8201;% were exhibited by a 0.062&#8208;cm2 device and 15.39&#8208;cm2 module, respectively. The devices retained over 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency under operation for 2200&#8197;h.

         <title>A Fourfold Gold(I)&#8722;Aryl Macrocycle with Hyperbolic Geometry and its Reductive Elimination to a Carbon Nanoring Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conformational flexible [6]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;phenylene derivative that can adopt a &#8220;chair&#8221; or a &#8220;boat&#8221; conformation and a rigid dinuclear gold(I) complex have been shown to form a metallacycle with a square geometry. Reductive elimination results in an all&#8208;organic nanoring with a large inner cavity that is suitable for the supramolecular binding of several guests with convex &#960;&#8208;surfaces.







Abstract
An ethylene glycol&#8208;decorated [6]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;phenylene (CMP) macrocycle was synthesized and utilized as a subunit to construct a fourfold AuI2&#8722;aryl metallacycle with an overall square arrangement. The corners consist of rigid dinuclear gold(I) complexes previously known to form only triangular metallacycles. The interplay between the conformational flexibility of the [6]CMP macrocycle and the rigid dinuclear gold(I) moieties enable the square geometry, as revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The formation of the gold complex shows size&#8208;selectivity compared to an alternative route using platinum(II) corner motifs. Upon reductive elimination, an all&#8208;organic ether&#8208;decorated carbon nanoring was obtained. Investigation as a host for the complexation of large guest molecules with a suitable convex &#960;&#8208;surfaces was accomplished using isothermal NMR binding titrations. Association constants for [6]cycloparaphenylene ([6]CPP), [7]CPP, C60, and C70 were determined.

         <title>A LDH Template Triggers the Formation of a Highly Compact MIL&#8208;53 Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane for Acid Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A LDH nanoflake template layer triggers conversion into a highly compact MIL&#8208;53 membrane. The template guides MIL&#8208;53 crystals to replicate its imprint out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and modulates the availability of Al from the alumina support for in&#8208;plane growth of MIL&#8208;53. The membrane can achieve complete dewatering from azeotropic formic acid and save 77&#8201;% of the energy consumption compared to distillation.







Abstract
Highly compact metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes offer hope for the ambition to cope with challenging separation scenarios with industrial implications. A continuous layer of layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoflakes on an alumina support as a template triggered a chemical self&#8208;conversion to a MIL&#8208;53 membrane, with approximately 8 hexagonal lattices (LDH) traded for 1 orthorhombic lattice (MIL&#8208;53). With the sacrifice of the template, the availability of Al nutrients from the alumina support was dynamically regulated, which resulted in synergy for producing membranes with highly compact architecture. The membrane can realize nearly complete dewatering from formic acid and acetic acid solutions, respectively, and maintain stability in a continuous pervaporation over 200&#8197;h. This is the first success in directly applying a pure MOF membrane to such a corrosive chemical environment (lowest pH value of 0.81). The energy consumption is saved by up to 77&#8201;% when compared with the traditional distillation.

         <title>Directing Group&#8208;Free Regioselective meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Functionalization of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine is one of the most abundant motifs in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, chemists were constrained in their ability to append substituents at the meta&#8208;position of pyridines. Two complementary one&#8208;pot approaches developed independently have helped to overcome this challenge. While one involves breaking the pyridine ring to form linear imines, the other relies on 1,4&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions to disrupt the aromaticity of pyridine.







Abstract
The pyridine core is among the most common motifs found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Consequently, the C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridine is a prized reaction, as it can help access a broad spectrum of valuable chemicals. However, the intrinsic electronic properties of pyridines hinder their meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization, requiring drastic conditions affecting functional group compatibility. A synthetic manoeuvre to overcome this challenge involves the temporary conversion of pyridines into electron&#8208;rich intermediates and subsequent regioselective electrophilic functionalization. This was recently accomplished by a ring&#8208;opening ring&#8208;closing sequence via Zincke imine intermediates by McNally and co&#8208;workers, and a dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization sequence via oxazino&#8208;pyridine intermediates by the Studer group. The mildness and simplicity of these protocols enable them to work with complex molecular setups for synthesizing natural products and bioactive molecules.

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence Distance and Reactivity of Coreactants Determine the Sensitivity of Bead&#8208;Based Immunoassays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) self&#8208;interference spectroscopy and microscopy imaging, the analytical sensitivity of bead&#8208;based ECL immunoassays was proposed to be determined by the light emission distance and reactivity of coreactant. Compared with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine, 2,2&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilotriethanol can balance the distance&#8208;reactivity trade&#8208;off and thus apparently promote the sensitivity of immunoassays.







Abstract
Herein we report the study of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) generation by tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium (Ru(bpy)32+) and five tertiary amine coreactants. The ECL distance and lifetime of coreactant radical cations were measured by ECL self&#8208;interference spectroscopy. And the reactivity of coreactants was quantitatively evaluated in terms of integrated ECL intensity. By statistical analysis of ECL images of single Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;labeled microbeads, we propose that ECL distance and reactivity of coreactant codetermine the emission intensity and thus the sensitivity of immunoassay. 2,2&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilotriethanol (BIS&#8208;TRIS) can well balance ECL distance&#8208;reactivity trade&#8208;off and enhance the sensitivity by 236&#8201;% compared with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) in the bead&#8208;based immunoassay of carcinoembryonic antigen. The study brings an insightful understanding of ECL generation in bead&#8208;based immunoassay and a way of maximizing the analytical sensitivity from the aspect of coreactant.

         <title>Alternative Fast and Slow Primary Charge&#8208;Separation Pathways in Photosystem II</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two primary charge separation pathways are identified in the reaction center of Photosystem II, corresponding to different time scales and kinetic phases.







Abstract
Photosystem&#8208;II (PSII) is a multi&#8208;subunit protein complex that harvests sunlight to perform oxygenic photosynthesis. Initial light&#8208;activated charge separation takes place at a reaction centre consisting of four chlorophylls and two pheophytins. Understanding the processes following light excitation remains elusive due to spectral congestion, the ultrafast nature, and multi&#8208;component behaviour of the charge&#8208;separation process. Here, using advanced computational multiscale approaches which take into account the large&#8208;scale configurational flexibility of the system, we identify two possible primary pathways to radical&#8208;pair formation that differ by three orders of magnitude in their kinetics. The fast (short&#8208;range) pathway is dominant, but the existence of an alternative slow (long&#8208;range) charge&#8208;separation pathway hints at the evolution of redundancy that may serve other purposes, adaptive or protective, related to formation of the unique oxidative species that drives water oxidation in PSII.

         <title>Generation and Use of Glycosyl Radicals under Acidic Conditions: Glycosyl Sulfinates as Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosyl radicals were generated under acidic conditions for the first time by the use of glycosyl sulfinates as precursors. This development enables the installation of glycosyl units directly onto pharmaceutically relevant pyridine cores by the Minisci reaction.







Abstract
We herein report a method that enables the generation of glycosyl radicals under highly acidic conditions. Key to the success is the design and use of glycosyl sulfinates as radical precursors, which are bench&#8208;stable solids and can be readily prepared from commercial starting materials. This development allows the installation of glycosyl units onto pyridine rings directly by the Minisci reaction. We further demonstrate the utility of this method in the late&#8208;stage modification of complex drug molecules, including the anticancer agent camptothecin. Experimental studies provide insight into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Effector Regulated Catalytic Cyclization of Alkynoic Acids Using Pt2L4 Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt2L4 cages are found to catalyze the cyclization of alkynoic acids. The reaction rates are depending on effector guests bound in the cage, leading to an enhancement of the catalytic rate by up to 19&#8208;fold or a decrease by 5&#8208;fold. In contrast to this effector&#8208;controlled rate enhancement using the binding pocket of Pt2L4, the molecular analogue PtL4 displays no significant changes in catalytic rate. By effector induced rate changes of cage catalyzed reactions, unexpected new reactivity and complex autoregulation comes in sight.







Abstract
Metabolic pathways are highly regulated by effector molecules that influences the rate of enzymatic reactions. Inspired by the catalytic regulation found in living cells, we report a Pt2L4 cage of which the activity can be controlled by effectors that bind inside the cage. The cage shows catalytic activity in the lactonization of alkynoic acids, with the reaction rates dependent on the effector guest bound in the cage. Some effector guests enhance the rate of the lactonization by up to 19&#8208;fold, whereas one decreases it by 5&#8208;fold. When mixtures of specific substrates are used, both starting materials and products act as guests for the Pt2L4 cage, enhancing its catalytic activity for one substrate while reducing its activity for the other. The reported regulatory behavior obtained by the addition of effector molecules paves the way to the development of more complex, metabolic&#8208;like catalyst systems.

         <title>Endogenous Enzyme&#8208;Operated Spherical Nucleic Acids for Cell&#8208;Selective Protein Capture and Localization Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the introduction of enzyme&#8208;responsive units in aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), enzyme&#8208;activatable SNAs can be constructed to mediate the connection between an enzyme biomarker and proteins of interest (POI) and enable cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective POI capture and translocation regulation. The enzyme&#8208;control strategy is expandable to regulate diverse POI with flexible aptamer design.







Abstract
Precise regulation of protein activity and localization in cancer cells is crucial to dissect the function of the protein&#8208;involved cellular network in tumorigenesis, but there is a lack of suitable methodology. Here we report the design of enzyme&#8208;operated spherical nucleic acids (E&#8208;SNAs) for manipulation of the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of proteins with cancer&#8208;cell selectivity. The E&#8208;SNAs are constructed by programmable engineering of aptamer&#8208;based modules bearing enzyme&#8208;responsive units in predesigned sites and further combination with SNA nanotechnology. We demonstrate that E&#8208;SNAs are able to regulate cytoplasmic&#8208;to&#8208;nuclear shuttling of RelA protein efficiently and specifically in tumor cells, while they remain inactive in normal cells due to insufficient enzyme expression. We further confirmed the generality of this strategy by investigating the enzyme&#8208;modulated inhibition/activation of thrombin activity by varying the aptamer&#8208;based design.
