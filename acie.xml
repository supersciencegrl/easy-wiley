      <title>Polyurethanes from Direct Organocatalytic Copolymerization of p&#8208;Tosyl Isocyanate with Epoxides</title>
      <dc:description>The direct copolymerization of  p  &#8208;tosyl isocyanate (TSI) with epoxides, initiated by onium salts in the presence of trialkylborane, to produce polyurethanes is reported. The rate of copolymerization and the (regio)selectivity were investigated in relation to the trialkylborane and initiator used. Under optimized conditions such copolymerizations have been successfully performed for a wide range of epoxides, including ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, 1&#8208;octene oxide, cyclohexene oxide, and allyl glycidyl ether. These copolymerizations afford a new category of polyurethanes, clear of side products such as cyclic oxazolidinone, isocyanurate, and poly(isocyanate) linkages. The experimental conditions used in this work are compatible with those for the organocatalytic (co)polymerization of other oxygenated monomers and CO  2  , holding the potential for their terpolymerization with  p  &#8208;tosyl isocyanate and the development of new materials with unprecedented properties.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The Generated DataBases (GDBs) enumerate billions of possible molecules following simple rules of chemical stability and synthetic feasibility. Exploring the GDBs shows that many chiral, 3D&#8208;shaped ring systems, often containing quaternary centers, have never been exploited for drug design.

      <title>Switching the Reactivity of Palladium Diimines with &#8216;Ancillary&#8217; Ligand to Select for Olefin Polymerization, Branching Regulation, or Olefin isomerization</title>
      <dc:description>Coordinating solvents are commonly employed as ancillary ligands to stabilize late transition metal complexes and are conventionally considered to have little effect on the reaction products. Our work identifies that the presence of ancillary ligand in Pd&#8208;diimine catalyzed polymerizations of &#945;&#8208;olefins can drastically alter reactivity.

Axial modification&#160;of cobalt complexes on heterogeneous surfaces leads to enhanced interfacial electron transfer for CO2&#160;reduction. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202008759), X. Wang et&#8197;al. report diphenyl sulfide as an axial ligand for tetraphenylporphyrin&#160;cobalt. The coordination promotes the redox activity of tetraphenylporphyrin cobalt immobilized on graphene through van der Waals interactions, and facilitates the generation of a reduced state of tetraphenylporphyrin cobalt to serve as the active site for electrochemical CO2&#160;reduction.

      <title>On the Promotion of Catalytic Reactions by Surface Acoustic Waves</title>
      <dc:description>
The mechanism of catalytic activation by surface acoustic waves (SAWs) is investigated by R. Imbihl et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202005883). An increase in catalytic activity of metal surfaces upon SAW excitation has been reported in numerous experiments, but the underlying mechanism needs yet to be identified. Possible causes such as SAW&#8208;induced surface restructuring and work function changes are systematically examined.

&lt;p&gt;A homochiral molecular ferroelectric was incorporated into a perovskite film to enlarge the built&#8208;in electric field of the perovskite solar cell, thereby facilitating charge separation and transportation for improved device performance. In their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.20200849410.1002/anie.202008494&lt;/a&gt;), J. Zhao, W.&#8208;Q. Liao, G.&#8208;F. Zou, and co&#8208;workers show that the molecular ferroelectric component of the perovskite solar cell passivates the defects in the perovskite active layers, reducing nonradiative recombination.

      <title>Salt to Taste: The Critical Roles Played by Inorganic Salts in Organozinc Formation and in the Negishi Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The first cross&#8208;coupling of organozinc nucleophiles with aryl halides was reported in 1977 by Negishi. Unknown to all at the time was the importance of salt additives that were often present as a byproduct from the organozinc preparation. For decades, these salt additives were overlooked until 2006 when it was discovered that two different, yet effective methods for preparing organozinc solutions (i.e. one with salt and one without) provided drastically different results. Since this finding, the exact role of salt additives in cross&#8208;coupling has been debated in the catalysis community. In this review we highlight all the major discoveries regarding the influence of salt additives on the formation of organozinc reagents and their use in the Negishi reaction. These effects include solubilizing key intermediates, the formation of higher order zincates, product inhibition, catalyst protection and solvent effects.</dc:description>

      <title>H2&#8208;free Re&#8208;based catalytic dehydroxylation of aldaric acid to muconic and adipic acid esters</title>
      <dc:description>Being one of the most demanded dicarboxylic acids, adipic acid can be directly produced from renewable sources. Hexoses from (hemi)cellulose are oxidized to aldaric acids and subsequently catalytically dehydroxylated. Hitherto performed homogeneously, we present the first heterogeneous catalytic process for converting an aldaric acid into muconic and adipic acid. The contribution of leached Re from the solid pre&#8208;reduced catalyst was also investigated with hot&#8208;filtration test and found to be inactive for dehydroxylation. Corrosive or hazardous (HBr/H  2  ) reagents are eschewed in lieu of simple alcohols and solid Re/C catalysts in an inert atmosphere. At 120 &#176;C, the carboxylic groups are protected by esterification, which prevents lactonisation in the absence of water or acidic sites. Dehydroxylation and partial hydrogenation yield monohexenoates (93%). For complete hydrogenation to adipate, a 16% higher activation barrier necessitates higher temperatures. The mechanism of selective removal of adjacent OH* groups on Re(0001) and the role of methanol in hydrogen transfer are elucidated by DFT calculations as well as XPS, chemisorption and HR&#8208;TEM experiments.</dc:description>

      <title>Discovery of Self&#8208;Assembling Small Molecules as Vaccine Adjuvants</title>
      <dc:description>Immune potentiators, termed adjuvant, trigger early innate immune responses to ensure the generation of robust and long&#8208;lasting adaptive immune responses of vaccines. Here we present study that takes advantage of a self&#8208;assembling small molecule library for the development of a novel vaccine adjuvant. Cell&#8208;based screening of the library and subsequent structural optimization led to the discovery of a simple, chemically tractable deoxycholate derivative (molecule  6  , also named cholicamide) whose well&#8208;defined nano&#8208;assembly potently elicits innate immune responses in macrophages and dendritic cells. Functional and mechanistic analyses indicate that the virus&#8208;like assembly is engulfed inside cells and stimulates the innate immune response through toll&#8208;like receptor 7 (TLR7), an endosomal TLR that detects single&#8208;stranded viral RNA. As an influenza vaccine adjuvant in mice, molecule  6  was as potent as Alum, a clinically used adjuvant. The studies described here paves the way for a new approach to discovering and designing self&#8208;assembling small&#8208;molecule adjuvants against pathogens, including emerging viruses.</dc:description>

Here we present study that takes advantage of a self&#8208;assembling small molecule library for the development of a novel vaccine adjuvant. Cell&#8208;based screening of the library and subsequent structural optimization led to the discovery of a simple, chemically tractable deoxycholate derivative (molecule  6  , also named cholicamide) whose well&#8208;defined nano&#8208;assembly potently elicits innate immune responses in macrophages and dendritic cells. Functional and mechanistic analyses indicate that the virus&#8208;like assembly is engulfed inside cells and stimulates the innate immune response through toll&#8208;like receptor 7 (TLR7), an endosomal TLR that detects single&#8208;stranded viral RNA. As an influenza vaccine adjuvant in mice, molecule  6  was as potent as Alum, a clinically used adjuvant. The studies described here paves the way for a new approach to discovering and designing self&#8208;assembling small&#8208;molecule adjuvants against pathogens, including emerging viruses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Self&#8208;Degradable Supramolecular Photosensitizer with High Photodynamic Therapeutic Efficiency and Improved Safety</title>
      <dc:description>Concerning that the residues of photosensitizers (PS) may cause serious side effects under light, it is of great significant to timely &#8216;switch off&#8217; PS after photodynamic therapy (PDT). Herein, we proposed a supramolecular strategy to regulate the activity of PS, fabricating a supramolecular PS with improved reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation efficiency and accelerated self&#8208;degradation ability. During PDT treatment, the supramolecular PS exhibited good therapeutic efficiency as well as reduced dark toxicity. Moreover, the supramolecular PS could be degraded by ROS generated by itself and lose its PDT activities once PDT treatment finished. In this way, the side effects of PDT can be reduced without sacrificing the therapeutic efficiency. This work provides a novel strategy for smarter PDT beacon to further improve the safety of PDT treatment.</dc:description>

      <title>Photodriven Disproportionation of Nitrogen and Its Change to Reductive Nitrogen Photofixation</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrogen fixation is an essential process for sustaining life. Tremendous efforts have been made on the photodriven fixation of nitrogen into ammonia. However, the disproportionation of dinitrogen to ammonia and nitrate under ambient conditions has yet remained a grand challenge. In this work, the photodriven disproportionation of nitrogen is realized in water under visible light and ambient conditions using Fe&#8208;doped TiO  2  microspheres. The oxygen vacancies associated with the Fe dopants activate chemisorbed N  2  molecules, which can then be fixed into NH  3  with H  2  O  2  as the oxidation product. The generated H  2  O  2  thereafter oxidizes NH  3  into nitrate. This disproportionation reaction can be turned to the reductive one by loading plasmonic Au nanoparticles in the doped TiO  2  microspheres. The generated H  2  O  2  can be effectively decomposed by the Au nanoparticles, resulting in the transformation of the disproportionation reaction to the completely reductive nitrogen photofixation.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The performance of Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is highly dependent on their interfacial chemistry, which is regulated by electrolytes. Conventional electrolyte typically contains polar solvents to dissociate Li salts. Herein we report a weakly&#8208;solvating electrolyte (WSE) that consists of a pure non&#8208;polar solvent, which leads to a peculiar solvation structure where ion pairs and aggregates prevail under a low salt concentration of 1.0 M.

      <dc:description>Substrate&#8208;supported metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) films are urgently desired for realizing their great potential in practical applications. Herein, a novel substrate&#8208;seeding secondary&#8208;growth strategy was developed to fabricate composite of uniform MOFs films on aerogel walls. Briefly, the organic ligand is &#8220;pre&#8208;seeded&#8221; onto the aerogel walls, and then a small amount of metal ions solution is sprayed onto the prepared aerogel. The sprayed solution is diffused along the aerogel walls to form a continuous thin layer, which confines the nucleation reaction, promoting the formation of uniform MOFs films on the aerogel walls. The whole fabrication process is simple in operation, highly efficient and eco&#8208;friendly. The resulted hierarchical MOFs/aerogel composites possess abundant accessible active sites and enables excellent mass transfer, which endows the composite outstanding catalytic activity and stability in both liquid phase CO2 cycloaddition and electrochemical OER process.</dc:description>

      <title>The key role of the interface in the highly sensitive mechanochromic luminescence properties of hybrid perovskites</title>
      <dc:description>Hybrid perovskite (HP) materials are of huge interest in both photovoltaics and lighting applications. Here we report that hybrid perovskite composites, as crystallized powders, can behave as intelligent materials showing highly sensitive and reversible mechanochromic luminescence (MCL). Composites consisting of monolayered 2D HP and 3D HP components exhibit reversible tunable colour emission upon mechanical strain. Spectroscopic investigations first reveal that the bluish&#8208;whitish emission of the 2D HP turns into orange in the composite due to an energy transfer process. The bright green emission, observed as soon as the composite is slightly crushed, originates from the 3D HP after efficient energy funnelling from the multi&#8208;layered 2D HP produced at the 2D/3D interface by the mechanical treatment. Besides highlighting the key role of the interfaces in light emission of HP, our findings pave the way for hybrid perovskites as highly sensitive MCL smart materials for mechanosensors, security papers or optical storage applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Coumarins by Direct Annulation: &#946;&#8208;Borylacrylates as Ambiphilic C3&#8208;Synthons</title>
      <dc:description>Modular &#946;&#8208;borylacrylates have been validated as programmable, ambiphilic C  3  &#8208;synthons in the cascade annulation of 2&#8208;halo&#8208;phenol derivatives to generate structurally and electronically diverse coumarins. Key to this [3+3] disconnection is the BPin unit which serves a dual purpose as both a traceless linker for C(sp  2  )&#8208;C(sp  2  ) coupling, and as a chromophore extension to enable inversion of the alkene geometry via selective energy transfer catalysis. Mild isomerisation is a pre&#8208;condition to access 3&#8208;substituted coumarins and provides a handle for divergence. The method is showcased in the synthesis of representative natural products that contain this venerable chemotype. Facile entry into &#960;&#8208;expanded estrone derivatives modified at the A&#8208;ring is disclosed to demonstrate the potential of the method in bioassay development or in drug repurposing.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Modular &#946;&#8208;borylacrylates have been validated as programmable, ambiphilic C  3  &#8208;synthons in the cascade annulation of 2&#8208;halo&#8208;phenol derivatives to generate structurally and electronically diverse coumarins. Key to this [3+3] disconnection is the BPin unit which serves a dual purpose as both a traceless linker for C(sp  2  )&#8208;C(sp  2  ) coupling, and as a chromophore extension to enable inversion of the alkene geometry via selective energy transfer catalysis. Mild isomerisation is a pre&#8208;condition to access 3&#8208;substituted coumarins and provides a handle for divergence. The method is showcased in the synthesis of representative natural products that contain this venerable chemotype. Facile entry into &#960;&#8208;expanded estrone derivatives modified at the A&#8208;ring is disclosed to demonstrate the potential of the method in bioassay development or in drug repurposing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>In&#8208;cell NMR of functional riboswitch aptamers in eukaryotic cells</title>
      <dc:description>We report here the in&#8208;cell NMR&#8208;spectroscopic observation of the binding of the cognate ligand 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine to the aptamer domain of the bacterial 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine&#8208;sensing riboswitch in eukaryotic cells, namely Xenopus laevis oocytes and in human HeLa cells. The riboswitch is sufficiently stable in both cell types to allow for detection of binding of the ligand to the riboswitch. Most importantly, we show that the binding mode established by in vitro characterization of this prokaryotic riboswitch is maintained in eukaryotic cellular environment. Our data also bring important methodological insights: Thus far, in&#8208;cell NMR studies on RNA in mammalian cells have been limited to investigations of short (&lt; 15 nt) RNA fragments that were extensively modified by protecting groups to limit their degradation in the intracellular space. Here, we show that the in&#8208;cell NMR setup can be adjusted for characterization of much larger (~ 70 nt) functional and chemically non&#8208;modified RNA.</dc:description>

      <title>Design, Identification and Evolution of Surface Ruthenium (II/III) Single&#8208;Site for CO Activation</title>
      <dc:description>Ru(II) compounds are widely used in catalysis, photocatalysis and medical applications. They are usually obtained in reductive environment as molecular O  2  can oxidize Ru(II) to Ru(III) and Ru(IV). Here we report the design, identification and evolution of an air&#8208;stable surface &#8208;[bipy&#8208;Ru(II)(CO)  2  Cl  2  ] site that is covalently mounted onto a polyphenylene framework. Such Ru(II) site was obtained by reduction of &#8208;[bipy&#8208;Ru(III)Cl  4  ]  &#8208;  with simultaneous ligand exchange from Cl  &#8208;  to CO. This structural evolution was witnessed by a combination of  in situ  X&#8208;ray and infrared spectroscopy studies. The &#8208;[bipy&#8208;Ru(II)(CO)  2  Cl  2  ] site enables oxidation of CO with a turnover frequency of 0.73 &#215;&#160;10  &#8208;2  s  &#8208;1  at 462 K, while the Ru(III) site is completely inert. This work contributes to the studies of structure&#8208;activity relationship by demonstrating a practical control over both geometric and electronic structures of single&#8208;site catalysts at molecular level, which can be further applied in other single site catalyst researches.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective N&#8208;terminal BRD4 bromodomain inhibitors by targeting non&#8208;conserved residues and structured water displacement</title>
      <dc:description>Bromodomain and extra&#8208;terminal (BET) family proteins, BRD2&#8208;4 and T, are important drug targets; however, the biological functions of each bromodomain remain ill&#8208;defined. Chemical probes that selectively inhibit a single BET bromodomain are lacking, although pan inhibitors of the first (D1), and second (D2), bromodomain are known. Here, we develop selective BET D1 inhibitors with preferred binding to of BRD4 D1. In competitive inhibition assays we show that our lead compound is 9&#8208;33 fold selective for BRD4 D1 over the other BET bromodomains. X&#8208;ray crystallography supports a role for the selectivity based on reorganization of a non&#8208;conserved lysine and displacement of an additional structured water&#160; in the BRD4 D1 binding site relative to our prior lead. Whereas pan&#8208;D1 inhibitors displace BRD4 from  MYC  enhancers, BRD4 D1 inhibition in MM.1S cells is insufficient for stopping Myc expression and may lead to its upregulation. Future analysis of BRD4 D1 gene regulation may shed light on differential BET bromodomain functions.</dc:description>

      <title>Reductive Hexamerization of CO Involving Cooperativity Between Magnesium(I) Reductants and [Mo(CO)6]: Synthesis of Well&#8208;Defined Magnesium Benzenehexolate Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Reactions of two magnesium(I) compounds, [{(ArNacnac)Mg}2] (ArNacnac = [HC(MeCNAr)2]&#8208;Ar = mesityl (Mes) or o&#8208;xylyl (Xyl)), with CO in the presence of [Mo(CO)6] lead to the reductive hexamerization of CO, and formation of magnesium benzenehexolate complexes, [{(ArNacnac)Mg}6(C6O6)]. [Mo(CO)6] is not consumed in these reactions, but is apparently required to initiate (or catalyze) the CO hexamerizations. A range of synthetic, spectroscopic and computational studies have been used to probe the mechanism of formation of the benzenehexolate complexes. The magnesium(I) reductive hexamerizations of CO are closely related to Liebig&#8217;s reduction of CO with molten potassium (to give K6C6O6, amongst other products), originally reported in 1834. As the mechanism of that reaction is still unknown, it seems reasonable that magnesium(I) reductions of CO could prove useful homogeneous models for its elucidation, and for the study of other C&#8208;C bond forming reactions that use CO as a C1 feedstock (e.g. the Fischer&#8208;Tropsch process).</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reactions of two magnesium(I) compounds, [{(ArNacnac)Mg}2] (ArNacnac = [HC(MeCNAr)2]&#8208;Ar = mesityl (Mes) or o&#8208;xylyl (Xyl)), with CO in the presence of [Mo(CO)6] lead to the reductive hexamerization of CO, and formation of magnesium benzenehexolate complexes, [{(ArNacnac)Mg}6(C6O6)]. [Mo(CO)6] is not consumed in these reactions, but is apparently required to initiate (or catalyze) the CO hexamerizations. A range of synthetic, spectroscopic and computational studies have been used to probe the mechanism of formation of the benzenehexolate complexes. The magnesium(I) reductive hexamerizations of CO are closely related to Liebig&#8217;s reduction of CO with molten potassium (to give K6C6O6, amongst other products), originally reported in 1834. As the mechanism of that reaction is still unknown, it seems reasonable that magnesium(I) reductions of CO could prove useful homogeneous models for its elucidation, and for the study of other C&#8208;C bond forming reactions that use CO as a C1 feedstock (e.g. the Fischer&#8208;Tropsch process).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Fragment Coupling Reactions in Total Synthesis That Form Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bonds via Carbanionic or Free Radical Intermediates</title>
      <dc:description>
This review presents a survey of recent examples of fragment coupling reactions that form carbon&#8211;carbon bonds via carbanionic or free radical intermediates in total synthesis. The aim is to identify extensible lessons from each example that might be useful to students in the field. Powerful advances in the generation and application of carbanionic and free radical intermediates in complex settings are highlighted.







Abstract
Fragment coupling reactions that form carbon&#8211;carbon bonds are valuable transformations in synthetic design. Advances in metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions in the early 2000s brought a high level of predictability and reliability to carbon&#8211;carbon bond constructions involving the union of unsaturated fragments. By comparison, recent years have witnessed an increase in fragment couplings proceeding via carbanionic and open&#8208;shell (free radical) intermediates. The latter has been driven by advances in methods to generate and utilize carbon&#8208;centered radicals under mild conditions. In this Review, we survey a selection of recent syntheses that have implemented carbanion&#8208; or radical&#8208;based fragment couplings to form carbon&#8211;carbon bonds. We aim to highlight the strategic value of these disconnections in their respective settings and to identify extensible lessons from each example that might be instructive to students.

      <title>High Ammonia Uptake of a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Adsorbent in a Wide Pressure Range</title>
      <dc:description>Although numerous porous adsorbents have been investigated for NH  3  &#160;capture applications, these materials often exhibit insufficient NH  3  uptake, low NH  3  affinity at the ppm level, and poor chemical stability against wet NH  3  conditions. Herein, we report the NH  3  capture properties of M  2  (dobpdc) complexes (M = Mg  2+  , Mn  2+  , Co  2+  , Ni  2+  , and Zn  2+  ; dobpdc  4&#8722;  = 4,4&#8208;dioxidobiphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;dicarboxylate) that contain open metal sites. The NH  3  uptake of Mg  2  (dobpdc) at 298 K was 23.9 mmol g  &#8722;1  at 1 bar and 8.25 mmol g  &#8722;1  at 570 ppm, which are record high capacities at both pressures among existing porous adsorbents. The strength of the interactions between the Lewis acid open metal sites and NH  3  followed the trend of Ni &gt; Mg &gt; Co &gt; Mn, which was determined by NH  3  &#8208;temperature programmed desorption curves. The structural stability of Mg  2  (dobpdc) upon exposure to wet NH  3  was superior to that of the other M  2  (dobpdc) and the frameworks tested. Our van der Waals&#8208;corrected density functional theory calculations predicted that this may be associated with the higher stability of MgO  6  coordination compared to that of Mg(NH  3  )  6  . Overall, these results demonstrate that Mg  2  (dobpdc) is a recyclable compound that exhibits significant NH  3  affinity and capacity, making it a promising candidate for real&#8208;world NH  3  &#8208;capture applications.</dc:description>

Based on the bright  THPP  , imaging with high frame rate (34 frames per second) in a deep &#8216;valid penetration depth&#8217; up to 6 mm can be achieved.

      <dc:description>Zinc (Zn) ion hybrid capacitors (ZIHCs) are promising energy storage devices for emerging flexible electronics, but they still suffer from trade&#8208;off in energy density and cycling life. Herein, we prove that such a dilemma can be well&#8208;addressed by deploying ZnCl  2  based electrolytes.

      <title>An Active&#8208;Site Sulfonate Group Creates a Fast Water Oxidation Electrocatalyst That Exhibits High Activity in Acid</title>
      <dc:description>The storage of solar energy in chemical bonds will depend on pH&#8208;universal catalysts that are not only impervious to acid, but actually thrive in it. Whereas other homogeneous water oxidation catalysts are less active in acid, here we report a catalyst that maintains high electrocatalytic turnover frequency at pH values as low as 1.1 and 0.43 (kcat = 1501 &#177; 608 s&#8208;1 and 831 &#177; 254 s&#8208;1, respectively). Moreover, current densities, related to catalytic reaction rates, ranged from 15 to 50 mA cm&#8208;2 mM&#8208;1 comparable to those reported for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art heterogeneous catalysts and 30 to 100 times greater than those measured here for two prominent literature homogeneous catalysts at pH 1.1 and 0.43. The catalyst also exhibits excellent durability when a chemical oxidant is used (CeIV, 7400 turnovers, TOF 0.88 s&#8208;1).

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The storage of solar energy in chemical bonds will depend on pH&#8208;universal catalysts that are not only impervious to acid, but actually thrive in it. Whereas other homogeneous water oxidation catalysts are less active in acid, here we report a catalyst that maintains high electrocatalytic turnover frequency at pH values as low as 1.1 and 0.43 (kcat = 1501 &#177; 608 s&#8208;1 and 831 &#177; 254 s&#8208;1, respectively). Moreover, current densities, related to catalytic reaction rates, ranged from 15 to 50 mA cm&#8208;2 mM&#8208;1 comparable to those reported for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art heterogeneous catalysts and 30 to 100 times greater than those measured here for two prominent literature homogeneous catalysts at pH 1.1 and 0.43. The catalyst also exhibits excellent durability when a chemical oxidant is used (CeIV, 7400 turnovers, TOF 0.88 s&#8208;1). Preliminary computational studies suggest that the unusual active&#8208;site sulfonate group acts a proton relay even in strong acid, as intended.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A surface strained and geometry tailored nanoreactor promotes the ammonia electrosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>A surface strained and geometry optimized TiO  2  nanoreactor was reported to enhance the performance of the electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation. The nanotubular confinement allows to spatially regulate the mass transport of nitrogen during the NRR process and offers an enlarged surface area, thus boosting the ammonia production with high selectivity. Besides, both experimental and theoretical evidence support strained Ti  3+  sites demonstrate a more favorable pathway for the N  2  activation and selective NH  3  production with a faster kinetic rate than the pristine TiO  2  .

      <title>Mn&#8208;O Covalency Governs the Intrinsic Activity of Co&#8208;Mn Spinel Oxides for Boosted Peroxymonosulfate Activation</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal (TM)&#8208;based bimetallic spinel oxides can efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) presumably attributed to enhanced electron transfer between TMs, but the existing model cannot fully explain the efficient TM redox cycling. Here, we discover a critical role of TM&#8208;O covalency in governing the intrinsic catalytic activity of Co  3&#8208;x  Mn  x  O  4  spinel oxides. Experimental and theoretical analysis reveal that the Co sites significantly raises the Mn valence and enlarges Mn&#8208;O covalency in octahedral configuration, thereby lowering the charge transfer energy to favor Mn  Oh  &#8208;PMS interaction. With appropriate Mn  IV  /Mn  III  ratio to balance PMS adsorption and Mn  IV  reduction, the Co  1.1  Mn  1.9  O  4  exhibits remarkable catalytic activities for PMS activation and pollutant degradation, outperforming all the reported TM spinel oxides. The improved understandings on the origins of spinel oxides activity for PMS activation may inspire the development of more active and robust metal oxide catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Precise alkoxyamine&#8208;design enables automated tandem mass spectrometry sequencing of digital poly(phosphodiester)s</title>
      <dc:description>Increasing data storage density is one of the major challenges of the information industry. To be widely applicable, writing and reading information have to be dense, convenient and fast. A major step towards reliable reading of information coded in the sequence of long poly(phosphodiester)s was previously achieved by introducing an alkoxyamine spacer between information sub&#8208;segments. However, MS/MS decoding had to be performed manually to safely identify useful fragments of low abundance compared to side&#8208;products induced by the amide&#8208;based alkoxyamine used. Here, alternative alkoxyamines were designed to prevent these side&#8208;reactions and enable automated MS/MS sequencing. Different styryl&#8208;TEMPO spacers were prepared to increase radical delocalization and stiffness of the structure. Their dissociation behavior was investigated by EPR and best MS/MS data were recorded for polymers with alkoxyamines containing in&#8208;chain benzyl ring, avoiding all side&#8208;reactions during synthesis or sequencing. As a result, automated decoding of these polymers can be achieved using the MS&#8208;DECODER software, which performs interpretation of fragmentation data recorded for each sub&#8208;segment prior to align the so&#8208;obtained digital sequences in their original order based on the mass tag defining the initial location of each sub&#8208;segment.</dc:description>

As a result, automated decoding of these polymers can be achieved using the MS&#8208;DECODER software, which performs interpretation of fragmentation data recorded for each sub&#8208;segment prior to align the so&#8208;obtained digital sequences in their original order based on the mass tag defining the initial location of each sub&#8208;segment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Phase&#8208;junction Electrocatalysts towards Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
      <dc:description>To ensure the sustainable hydrogen production via water electrolysis technique, robust, earth&#8208;abundant and high&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst is highly required. Nowadays, to overcome the limitation of conventional single&#8208;phase  component  , constructing hybrid system could lead to further improvement in electrocatalytic activity.

Here, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we presented a combination of theoretical and experimental investigation to certify that nickel diphosphide phase&#8208;junction (c&#8208;NiP  2  /m&#8208;NiP2  ) is an effective electrocatalyst for hydrogen production in alkaline media. The overpotential (at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) for NiP2&#8208;650 (c/m  ) in alkaline media could be significantly reduced by 26% and 96% compared with  c&#8208;NiP2  and  m&#8208;NiP2  , respectively. The enhancement of&#160;catalytic activity should be attributed to the strong water dissociation ability and the rearrangement of electrons around the phase&#8208;junction, which markedly improved the Volmer step and benefited the reduction process of adsorbed protons.</dc:description>

      <title>Antioxidative Stannous Oxalate Derived Lead&#8208;Free Stable CsSnX3&#160;(X = Cl, Br, and I) Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>The current research on all&#8208;inorganic perovskite NCs is mainly focused on Pb&#8208;based materials (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, and I). However, the toxicity of Pb has become a major obstacle to its application. Correspondingly, lead&#8208;free CsSnX3 perovskite NCs are becoming a promising alternative, but suffer from extremely poor stability. Herein, we highlight the significant effect of Sn(II) precursors used in the synthesis on the stability of the resultant CsSnX3 NCs. A new method is proposed for synthesizing CsSnX3 NCs using Cs2CO3, SnC2O4, and NH4X as corresponding constituent precursors, wherein the ratio of reactants can be facilely adjusted. Stable CsSnX3 NCs can be obtained with the use of antioxidative SnC2O4 as the Sn(II) precursor. Experimental results show that the improvement of NCs stability is mainly ascribed to the role of oxalate in the SnC2O4 precursor. Oxalate ion has a strong antioxidative ability and can effectively inhibit the oxidation of Sn(II) during the synthesis. Besides, oxalate as a bidentate capping ligand is demonstrated to be coordinated on the surface of formed NCs. This can not only passivate the uncoordinated Sn on the surface but also prevent the oxidation of the NCs.</dc:description>

      <title>Simultaneous Enantiospecific Detection of Multiple Compounds in Mixtures using NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Chirality plays a fundamental role in nature, but its detection and quantification still face many limitations. To date, the enantiospecific analysis of mixtures necessarily requires prior separation of the individual components. The simultaneous enantiospecific detection of multiple chiral molecules in a mixture represents a major challenge, which would lead to a significantly better understanding of the underlying biological processes; e.g. via enantiospecifically analysing metabolites in their native environment.

      <title>Revealing isolated M&#8208;N3C1 active sites for efficient collaborative oxygen reduction catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Single atom catalysts (SACs) are of great importance for oxygen reduction, a critical process in renewable energy technologies such as fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. The catalytic performance of SACs largely depends on the structure of their active sites, but explorations of highly active structures for SAC active sites are still limited. Herein, we demonstrate a combined experimental and theoretical study of oxygen reduction catalysis on SACs, which incorporate M&#8208;N 3  C 1  site structure, composed of atomically dispersed transition metals (e.g., Fe, Co, and Cu) in nitrogen doped carbon nanosheets. The resulting SACs with M&#8208;N 3  C 1  sites exhibited prominent oxygen reduction catalytic activities in both acidic and alkaline media, following the trend Fe&#8208;N 3  C 1  &gt; Co&#8208;N 3  C 1  &gt; Cu&#8208;N 3  C 1  . Theoretical calculations suggest the C atoms in these structures behave as collaborative adsorption sites to M atoms, thanks to interactions between the d  / p  orbitals of the M/C atoms in the M&#8208;N 3  C 1  sites, enabling dual site oxygen reduction. Compared with the common single site mechanism, the proposed dual site mechanism was determined to be more favorable for oxygen reduction catalysis, in good agreement with the experimental findings.</dc:description>

      <title>Assembly&#8208;Induced Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Spirocyclic Chiral Silver(I) Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>Supramolecular assembly of molecular chiral compounds is crucial for the comprehension of chirality propagation and achieving superior chirality&#8208;related properties. In this work, spirocyclic Ag 9  clusters as a new form of intrinsically chiral metal clusters have been constructed through vertex&#8208;sharing of two in situ  generated heteroaryl diide&#8208;centered metal rings. Such core&#8208;peripheral type clusters exhibit versatile photoluminescent and chiroptical behaviours under different aggregation conditions. In contrast to a ligand&#8208;based fluorescence emission in a diluted solution of the clusters, a solvent polarity&#8208;caused assembly gives rise to new cluster&#8208;based phosphorous luminescence due to radiative mode switching and aggregation&#8208;induced emission. Furthermore, the assembly of cluster enantiomers engenders micrometer&#8208;long helical nanofibers, whose handedness is determined by absolute configuration of individual spirocyclic clusters. Benefiting from exciton couplings of helical arrangements of chelating ligands at both molecular and microscopic levels, the assembled film of cluster enantiomers exhibits circularly polarized luminescence with a remarkably high anisotropy factor of 0.16.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Zeolite channel geometry&#8211;reaction intermediate relationships during the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon process were identified using advanced solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. As described by M. Baldus, B.&#8197;M. Weckhuysen, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202009139), the more extended straight zeolite channels promote the aromatic cycle, while the more constrained sinusoidal zeolite channels favor the olefin cycle.

Unlike BCBs bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, which react with nucleophiles at the &#946;&#8208;position, BCB&#8208;Bpin reacts with a diverse set of heteroatom (O, S, N)&#8208;centred nucleophiles exclusively at the &#945;&#8208;position.
