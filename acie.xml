         <title>Non&#8208;fused Star&#8208;shape Giant Trimer Electron Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency over 19%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on giant molecular acceptors (GMAs) have attracted extensive attention due to their excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operation stability. However, the large conjugated plane of GMAs poses great challenges in regulating the solubility, over&#8208;size aggregation and yield, which in turn further constrains their development in commercial products. Herein, we employ a non&#8208;fused skeleton strategy to develop novel non&#8208;fused star&#8208;shape trimers (3BTT6F and 3BTT6Cl) for improving device performance. Single&#8208;bond linkage can break the rigid planarity to form a 3D architecture, generating multidimensional charge transfer pathways. Importantly, the non&#8208;fused skeleton strategy can not only significantly improve solubility and synthesis yield, but also effectively suppress molecular excessive aggregation. Consequently, due to the optimized film&#8208;forming process and charge dynamics, 3BTT6F&#8208;based binary device obtains a high PCE of 17.52%, which is significantly higher than the reported fully fused trimers. Excitingly, 3BTT6F&#8208;based ternary device even obtains a top&#8208;level PCE of 19.26%. Furthermore, the non&#8208;fused star&#8208;shape configuration also endows these acceptors with enhanced intermolecular interaction in the active layer, demonstrating excellent operational stability. Our work emphasizes the potential of non&#8208;fused star&#8208;shape trimers, providing a new pathway for achieving highly efficient and stable OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Asymmetric Diamination of Allylic Alcohols through Borrowing Hydrogen Catalysis: Diastereo&#8208;divergent Synthesis of Tetrahydrobenzodiazepines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein an unprecedented, catalytic enantioconvergent diamination of racemic allylic alcohols with the construction of two C&#8208;N bonds and 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters. This iridium/chiral phosphoric acid cooperative catalytic system operates through an atom&#8208;economical borrowing hydrogen amination/aza&#8208;Michael cascade, and converts readily available phenylenediamines and racemic allylic alcohols to 1,5&#8208;tetrahydrobenzodiazepines in high enantioselectivity. An intriguing solvent&#8208;dependent switch of diastereoselectivity was also observed. Mechanistic studies suggested a dynamic kinetic resolution process involving racemization through a reversible Michael addition, making the last step of asymmetric imine reduction the enantiodetermining step of this cascade process.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Component High&#8208;Resolution Dual&#8208;Tone EUV Photoresists Based on Precision Self&#8208;Immolative Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron beam (EB) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography are advanced techniques capable of achieving sub&#8208;10 nm resolutions, critical for fabricating next&#8208;generation nanostructures and semiconductor devices. However, developing EUV photoresists that meet all demands for resolution, line edge roughness (LER), and sensitivity (RLS) remains a significant challenge. Herein, we introduce high&#8208;performance photoresists based on single&#8208;component self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) with inherent signal amplification via cascade degradation. These SIPs function as dual&#8208;tone photoresists under both EB and EUV lithography, with performance primarily determined by the exposure dose. Lithographic evaluations show that discrete SIPs provide significant improvements over disperse counterparts, achieving higher resolution and reduced LER. Specifically, a discrete SIP with a DP of 12 produces a line&#8208;space pattern with a resolution of approximately 18 nm and an LER of 1.8 nm, compared to 21 nm resolution and 2.5 nm LER for disperse SIPs. Additionally, these SIP&#8208;based photoresists, enriched with aromatic structures, exhibit excellent etch resistance. The single&#8208;component nature and potential to address the RLS trade&#8208;off underscore the promise of discrete SIPs for EUV lithography.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualizing Triplet Energy Transfer in Organic Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescent Host&#8208;Guest Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Limited by the energy gap law, purely organic materials with efficient near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence are rare and difficult to achieve. Additionally, the exciton transition process among different emitting species in host&#8208;guest phosphorescent materials remains elusive, presenting a significant academic challenge. Herein, using a modular nonbonding orbital&#8208;&#960; bridge&#8208;nonbonding orbital (n&#8208;&#960;&#8208;n) molecular design strategy, we develop a series of heavy atom&#8208;free phosphors. Systematic modification of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated cores enables the construction of a library with tunable near&#8208;infrared phosphorescence from 655 to 710 nm. These phosphors exhibit excellent performance under ambient conditions when dispersed into a 4&#8208;bromobenzophenone host matrix, achieving an extended lifetime of 11.25 ms and a maximum phosphorescence efficiency of 4.2%. Notably, by eliminating the interference from host phosphorescence, the exciton transition process can be visualized in hybrid materials under various excitation conditions. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that the improved phosphorescent performance of the guest originates from the triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer of abundant triplet excitons generated independently by the host, rather than from enhanced intersystem crossing efficiency between the guest singlet state and the host triplet state. The findings provide in&#8208;depth insights into constructing novel near&#8208;infrared phosphors and exploring emission mechanisms of host&#8208;guest materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantum Spin Exchange Interactions Trigger O p Band Broadening for Enhanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pressing demand for large&#8208;scale energy storage solutions has propelled the development of advanced battery technologies, among which zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are prominent due to their resource abundance, high capacity, and safety in aqueous environments. However, the use of manganese oxide cathodes in ZIBs is challenged by their poor electrical conductivity and structural stability, stemming from the intrinsic properties of MnO2 and the destabilizing effects of ion intercalation. To overcome these limitations, our research delves into atomic&#8208;level engineering, emphasizing quantum spin exchange interactions (QSEI). These essential for modifying electronic characteristics, can significantly influence material efficiency and functionality. We demonstrate through density functional theory (DFT) calculations that enhanced QSEI in manganese oxides broadens the O p band, narrows the bandgap, and improves both proton adsorption and electron transport. Empirical evidence is provided through the synthesis of Ru&#8208;MnO2 nanosheets, which display a marked increase in energy storage capacity, achieving 314.4 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1 and maintaining high capacity after 2000 cycles. Our findings underscore the potential of QSEI to enhance the performance of TMO cathodes in ZIBs, pointing to new avenues for advancing battery technology</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilic Fluoride Anion Delivery from Triazacyclononane&#8208;Supported Molecular Ca&#8211;F Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The major source of fluoride, namely calcium difluoride (CaF2), is derived from the mineral fluorspar. Recent advances in the activation of CaF2 via mechanochemical methods have inspired investigation of the fundamental properties of Ca&#8211;F bonds in molecular complexes. However, the paucity of well&#8208;defined molecular Ca&#8211;F&#8208;containing complexes undermines systematic understanding of the factors governing nucleophilic fluoride delivery. Here we report the use of a multidentate bis(phenoxide) ligand based on a 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) scaffold for the formation of well&#8208;defined Ca&#8211;F complexes and demonstrate their capabilities in fluoride delivery. Key to this synthesis is a desymmetrization step carried out on the TACN ligand within the Ca coordination sphere. A series of stable anionic dinuclear calcium fluoride complexes has then been accessed and characterized by NMR spectroscopy (critically by 19F NMR) and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Nucleophilic fluoride delivery can be used to generate C&#8211;F, Si&#8211;F and S&#8211;F bonds, with a notable advance over amide&#8208;derived ligand scaffolds being the reduced extent of side reactions derived from competing attack on the electrophile by the less nucleophilic O&#8208;donor anionic ligand set.</dc:description>

Here we report the use of a multidentate bis(phenoxide) ligand based on a 1,4,7-triazacyclononane (TACN) scaffold for the formation of well-defined Ca&#8211;F complexes and demonstrate their capabilities in fluoride delivery. Key to this synthesis is a desymmetrization step carried out on the TACN ligand within the Ca coordination sphere. A series of stable anionic dinuclear calcium fluoride complexes has then been accessed and characterized by NMR spectroscopy (critically by 19F NMR) and X-ray crystallography. Nucleophilic fluoride delivery can be used to generate C&#8211;F, Si&#8211;F and S&#8211;F bonds, with a notable advance over amide-derived ligand scaffolds being the reduced extent of side reactions derived from competing attack on the electrophile by the less nucleophilic O-donor anionic ligand set.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;N Coordination in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries: Inhibiting Catalyst Passivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries exhibit great potential as the next&#8208;generation energy storage techniques. Application of catalyst is widely adopted to accelerate the redox kinetics of polysulfide conversion reactions and improve battery performance. Although significant attention has been devoted to seeking new catalysts, the problem of catalyst passivation remains underexplored. Herein, we find that metal&#8208;N coordination has a previously overlooked role in preventing the catalyst passivation. In the case of nickel, the Ni catalyst reacts with S8 to produce NiSx compounds on the surface, leading to catalyst passivation and slow the kinetics of LiPSs conversion. In contrast, when Ni is coordinated with N (typically Ni&#8208;N4), S8 remains stable on the surface. The Ni&#8208;N4 exhibits excellent resistance to passivation and rapid kinetics of LiPSs conversion. Consequently, the sulfur cathode with Ni&#8208;N4 exhibits a high rate capability of 604.11 mAh g&#8208;1 at 3 C and maintains a low capacity decay rate of 0.046% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 2 C. Furthermore, preventing S passivation in M&#8208;N coordination applies not only to Ni&#8208;N4 but also to various coordination numbers and transition metals. This study reveals a new aspect of metal&#8208;N coordination in inhibiting catalyst passivation, improving our understanding of catalysts in Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution&#8208;processing induced H&#8208;aggregate of Perylene&#8208;Diimide Zwitterion Exhibiting Compact Molecular Stacking toward Efficient Cathode Modification in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance organic cathode interlayers (CILs) play a crucial role in the advance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, organic CILs have exhibited inferior performances to their inorganic counterparts over a long time, due to the inherent shortcoming of poor charge transporting capability. Here, we designed and synthesized a perylene&#8208;diimide (PDI) zwitterion PDI&#8208;B as high&#8208;performance organic CIL for OSCs. We revealed that an obvious H&#8208;aggregate of PDI&#8208;B was formed during the solution processing, thereby significantly enhancing the charge transporting capability of the CIL. Compared to the classic PDINN, the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance of PDI&#8208;B was reduced from 4.2 &#197; to 3.9 &#197;, which further facilitated the charge transport. Consequently, PDI&#8208;B showed a high conductivity of 1.81&#215;10&#8722;3S/m; this is comparable to that of inorganic CILs. The binary OSC showed an elevated PCE of 19.23%, which is among the highest PCE values for binary OSCs. Benefitting from improved solvent resistance and good compatibility with large&#8208;area processing method of PDI&#8208;B, the photovoltaic performances of inverted and 1&#8208;cm2 OSC were significantly improved. The results from this work provide a new approach of optimizing the condensed structure of PDI film to boost the charge conductivity, opening an avenue to develop high&#8208;performance PDI&#8208;based CILs.</dc:description>

         <title>LiLnGeS4 (Ln = La&#8211;Nd): Designing High Performance Infrared Nonlinear Optical Sulfides through &#8220;Band Reformation of AGS&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>AgGaS2 (AGS) is the most commonly used commercial infrared nonlinear optical material. However, AGS has a narrow band gap (Eg = 2.58 eV) and a low laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LIDT), primarily attributed to its mobile liquid&#8208;like Ag+ constituent and the unstable Ag&#8211;S chemical bond. Herein, we propose a &#8220;band reformation of AGS&#8221; strategy, which leads to the success syntheses of four lanthanide sulfides, LiLnGeS4, crystalizing in an asymmetric Ama2 structure. LiLaGeS4 demonstrates that eliminating the presence of Ag&#8208;4d band increases the Eg to 3.32 eV and enhances the LIDT (14&#8211;29 &#215; AGS, measured by both powder and single crystal); while increasing the nonbonding density of states of the S&#8208;3p band enhances the 2nd&#8208;nonlinear optical coefficient (1.06 &#215; AGS). Besides, the bond length discrepancy between [LiS4], [GeS4] and [LaS8] units leads to a moderate birefringence (&#916;n = 0.052). Such a unique structure further results in extremely small thermal expansion with &#945;L = 0.41&#8211;1.74 &#215; 10&#8208;5 K&#8208;1, along different crystallographic axes. Our theoretical studies indicate that the synergy of the structure building units contribute to the second harmonic generation performance. These results suggest that the &#8220;band reformation of AGS&#8221; strategy provides effective guidance to discover new NLO crystals with optimized performance.</dc:description>

         <title>As Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Meets with Noncovalent Conformational Locks: Subtly Regulating NIR&#8208;II Molecules for Multimodal Imaging&#8208;Navigated Synergistic Therapies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phototheranostics is growing into a sparking frontier in disease treatment. Developing single molecular species synchronously featured by powerful absorption capacity, superior second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence and prominent photothermal conversion ability is highly desirable for phototheranostics, yet remains formidably challenging. In this work, we propose a molecular design philosophy that the integration of noncovalent conformational locks (NoCLs) with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in a single formulation is able to boost multiple photophysical properties for efficient phototheranostics. The introduction of NoCLs skeleton with conformation&#8208;locking feature in the center of molecular architecture indeed elevates the structural planarity and rigidity, which simultaneously promotes the absorption capacity and bathochromic&#8208;shifts the emission wavelength centered in NIR&#8208;II region. Meanwhile, the AIE tendency mainly originated from flexibly propeller&#8208;like geometry at the ends of molecular architecture eventually endows the molecule with satisfactory emission intensity and photothermal conversion in aggregates. Consequently, by utilizing the optimized molecule, unprecedented performance on NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging&#8208;guided photothermal&#8208;chemo synergistic therapy is demonstrated by the precise tumor diagnosis and complete tumor ablation.</dc:description>

         <title>Concise and Modular Chemoenzymatic Total Synthesis of Bisbenzylisoquinoline Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids (bisBIAs) have attracted tremendous attention from the synthetic community due to their diverse and intriguing biological activities. Herein, we report the convergent and modular chemoenzymatic syntheses of eight bisBIAs bearing various substitutes and linkages in 5&#8208;7 steps. The gram&#8208;scale synthesis of various well&#8208;designed enantiopure benzylisoquinoline monomers was accomplished via an enzymatic stereoselective Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction, followed by regioselective enzymatic methylation or chemical functionalizations in a sequential one&#8208;pot process. A modified intermolecular copper&#8208;mediated Ullmann coupling enabled the concise and efficient total synthesis of five different linear bisBIAs with either head&#8208;to&#8208;tail or tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail linkage. &#160;A biomimetic oxidative phenol dimerization selectively formed the sterically hindered, electron&#8208;rich diaryl ether bond, and subsequent intramolecular Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura domino reaction or Ullmann coupling facilitated the first enantioselective total synthesis of three macrocyclic bisBIAs, including ent&#8208;isogranjine, tetrandrine and O&#8208;methylrepandine. This study highlights the great potential of chemoenzymatic strategies in the total synthesis of diverse bisBIAs and paves the way to further explore the biological functions of these natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Antimony Component Schottky Nanoheterojunctions as Ultrasound&#8208;Heightened Pyroptosis Initiators for Sonocatalytic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) holds promise due to its exceptional penetration depth; however, the rapid recombination of electron&#8208;hole (e&#8722;&#8208;h+) pairs and the complex tumor microenvironment (TME) impede its broader application. Herein, we discovered that antimony (Sb)&#8208;based nanomaterials induced pyroptosis in cancer cells. Therefore, a Schottky heterojunction containing a Sb component (Sb2Se3@Pt) was effectively designed and constructed via in&#8208;situ growth of platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) on a Sb2Se3 semiconductor with narrow bandgaps, which were utilized as US&#8208;heightened pyroptosis initiators to induce highly effective pyroptosis in cancer cells to boost SCT&#8208;immunotherapy. The biological effects of the Sb2Se3@Pt nanoheterojunction itself combined with the sonocatalytic amplification of oxidative stress significantly induced Caspase&#8208;1/GSDMD&#8208;dependent pyroptosis in cancer cells. Therefore, SCT treatment with Sb2Se3@Pt not only effectively restrained tumor proliferation but also induced potent immune memory responses and suppressed tumor recurrence. Furthermore, the integration of this innovative strategy with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment elicited a systemic immune response, effectively augmenting therapeutic effects and impeding the growth of abscopal tumors. Overall, this study provides further opportunities to explore pyroptosis&#8208;mediated SCT&#8208;immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances of Organic Cocrystals in Emerging Cutting&#8208;Edge Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic cocrystals, representing one type of new functional materials, have gathered significant interest in various engineering areas. Owing to their diverse stacking modes, rich intermolecular interactions and abundant functional components, the physicochemical properties of organic cocrystals can be tailored to meet different requirements and exhibit novel characteristics. The past few years have witnessed the rapid development of organic cocrystals in both fundamental characteristics and various applications. Beyond the typical properties like ambipolarity, emission tuning ability, ferroelectricity, etc. that are previously well demonstrated, many novel impressive and cutting&#8208;edge properties and applications of cocrystals also emerge and advance recently. Especially during the nearest five years, photothermal conversion, room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, thermally activated delay fluorescence, circularly polarized luminescence, organic solid&#8208;state lasers, near&#8208;infrared sensing, photocatalysis, batteries, and stimuli responses have been reported. In this minireview, these new properties are carefully summarized. Besides, some neoteric architecture and methodologies, such as host&#8208;guest structures and machine learning&#8208;based screening, are introduced. Finally, the potential future developments and expectations for organic cocrystals are discussed for further investigation on multiple functions and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Pentagon&#8208;Rich Caged Carbon Catalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction&#160;in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction between electron spin and oxygen molecules in non&#8208;platinum catalysts, particularly carbon catalysts, significantly influences the catalytic performance of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A promising approach to developing high&#8208;performance catalysts involves introducing five&#8208;membered ring structures with spin electrons into graphitic carbons. In this study, we present the successful synthesis of cage&#8208;like cubic carbon catalysts enriched with pentagon structures using pentagon ring&#8208;containing C60 and a NaCl template. The number of pentagons contained in the structure was increased by doping with nitrogen and annealing, and the number of electron spins also increased, thereby improving catalytic activity. The prepared catalyst exhibits remarkable activity in ORR under acidic electrolytes. Furthermore, we elucidate the correlation between the pentagon structure, the number of spin electrons, and catalytic activity, demonstrating that enhanced activity is contingent upon the presence of spin electrons. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the role of spin electrons in improving activity. The concept of spin electrons and the introduction of pentagon structures provide new design principles for carbon catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Flavin&#8208;Catalyzed, Photochemical Conversion of Dehydroalanine into 4,5&#8208;Dihydroxynorvaline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical synthesis of unnatural amino acids (UAA) is a key strategy for preparing designed peptides, including pharmaceutically active compounds. Alterations of existing amino acid residues such as dehydroalanine (Dha) are particularly important since selected positions can be addressed without the necessity of a complete de novo synthesis. The intriguing UAA 4,5&#8208;dihydroxynorvaline (Dnv) is found in a variety of naturally occurring peptides and biologically active compounds. However, no method is currently available to modify an existing peptide with this residue. We report the use of flavin catalysts and visible light irradiation for this challenge, which serves as a versatile strategy for converting Dha into Dnv. Our study shows that excited flavins are competent hydrogen atom abstraction catalysts for ethers and acetals, which allows masked 1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethylene functionalization from 2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane. The masked diol was successfully coupled to Dha residues, and a series of Dnv&#8208;containing products is reported. A mild and orthogonal protocol for deprotection of the acetal group was also identified, allowing free Dnv&#8208;modified peptides to be obtained. This method provides a straightforward strategy for Dnv functionalization, which is envisioned to be crucial for accessing natural products and synthetic analogues with pharmaceutical activity.</dc:description>

This reaction was investigated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations and fine&#8208;tuned through the application of a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach.

         <title>Emission Library and Applications of 2,1,3&#8208;Benzothiadiazole and Its Derivative&#8208;Based Luminescent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic linker&#8208;based luminescent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (LMOFs) have received extensive attention due to their promising applications in chemical sensing, energy transfer, solid&#8208;state&#8208;lighting and heterogeneous catalysis. Benefiting from the virtually unlimited emissive organic linkers and the intrinsic advantages of MOFs, significant progress has been made in constructing LMOFs with specific emission behaviors and outstanding performances. Among these reported organic linkers, 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivatives, as unique building units with tunable electron&#8208;withdrawing abilities, can be used to synthesize numerous emissive linkers with a donor&#8208;bridge&#8208;acceptor&#8208;bridge&#8208;donor type structure. These linkers were utilized to coordinate with different metal nodes, forming LMOFs with diverse underlying nets and optical properties. In this Minireview, 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative&#8208;based organic linkers and their corresponding LMOFs are summarized with which an emission library is built between the linker structures and the emission behaviors of constructed LMOFs. In particular, the preparation of LMOFs with customized emission properties ranging from deep&#8208;blue to near&#8208;infrared and sizes from dozens to hundreds of nanometers is discussed in detail. The applications of these LMOFs, including chemical sensing, energy harvesting and transfer, and catalysis, are then highlighted. Key perspectives and challenges for the future development of LMOFs are also addressed.</dc:description>

In this Minireview, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and its derivative-based organic linkers and their corresponding LMOFs are summarized with which an emission library is built between the linker structures and the emission behaviors of constructed LMOFs. In particular, the preparation of LMOFs with customized emission properties ranging from deep-blue to near-infrared and sizes from dozens to hundreds of nanometers is discussed in detail. The applications of these LMOFs, including chemical sensing, energy harvesting and transfer, and catalysis, are then highlighted. Key perspectives and challenges for the future development of LMOFs are also addressed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning Reaction Kinetics of Fluorinated Molecules to Construct Robust Solid Electrolyte Interphases on SiOx  Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing fluorinated electrolyte additives to construct LiF&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Si&#8208;based anodes is proven an effective strategy for coping with its massive volume changes during cycling. However, most current research on fluorine&#8208;containing additives focuses on their thermodynamics of decomposition, lacking studies on the correlation between the molecular structure of additives and their decomposition kinetics. Herein, two fluorinated ester additives, diethyl fluoromalonate (F1DEM) and diethyl 2,2&#8208;difluoromalonate (F2DEM) were designed and synthesized. Through combining a wealth of characterizations and simulations, it is revealed that despite the similar reduction thermodynamics, the favorable reduction kinetics of single&#8208;fluorinated F1DEM facilitate a LiF&#8208;rich layer during the early stage of SEI formation, contributing to the formation of a more robust SEI on SiOx anode compared to the difluorinated F2DEM. Consequently, the proposed additive achieves excellent cycling stability (84 % capacity retention after 1000 cycles) for 5 Ah 21700 cylindrical batteries under practical testing conditions. By unveiling the role of reaction kinetics, a long&#8208;overlooked aspect for the study of electrolyte additives, this work sheds light on how to construct a stable SEI on Si&#8208;based anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Discovery of a Potent Inhibitor of the Ferric Citrate Binding Protein FecB in Vibrio Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infections caused by Gram&#8208;negative bacteria present a significant risk to human health worldwide. Novel strategies are needed to deal with the challenge caused by drug&#8208;resistant bacteria. Here, we report a new approach to combat infections by targeting iron&#8208;binding proteins to suppress bacterial growth. We investigated the function of the conserved periplasmic binding protein FecB from Vibrio alginolyticus. FecB was known to play a crucial role in the bacterial growth and to relate with biofilm formation. We then solved the crystal structures and elucidated the binding mechanism of FecB with ferric ion chelated by citrate. The results indicated that FecB binds weakly to one citrate molecule and strongly to the Fe3+&#8208;(citrate)2 complex. Based on these results, a structure&#8208;based virtual screening approach was conducted against FecB to identify small molecules that block ferric&#8208;citrate uptake. Further evaluations in vivo and in vitro demonstrated that salvianolic acid C significantly suppressed bacterial growth, indicating that targeting bacterial nutrient absorption is a promising strategy for identifying potential antibacterial drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing the  Unconventional Cubic Phase in 2D LaNiO3 Perovskite for Highly Efficient Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phase engineering is a critical strategy in electrocatalysis, as it allows for the modulation of electronic, geometric, and chemical properties to directly influence the catalytic performance. Despite its potential, phase engineering remains particularly challenging in thermodynamically stable perovskites, especially in a 2D structure constraint. Herein, we report phase engineering in 2D LaNiO3 perovskite using the strongly non&#8208;equilibrium microwave shock method. This approach enables the synthesis of conventional hexagonal and unconventional trigonal and cubic phases in LaNiO3 by inducing selective phase transitions at designed temperatures, followed by rapid quenching to allow precise phase control while preserving the 2D porous structure.  These phase transitions induce structural distortions in the [LaO]+ layers and the hybridization between Ni 3d and O 2p states, thus modifying local charge distribution and enhancing electron transport during the six&#8208;electron urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The cubic LaNiO3 offers optimal electron transport and active site accessibility due to its high structural symmetry and open interlayer spacing, resulting in a low onset potential of 1.27 V and a Tafel slope of 33.1 mV dec&#8208;1 for UOR, outperforming most current catalysts. Our strategy features high designability in phase engineering, enabling various electrocatalysts to harness the power of unconventional phases.</dc:description>

         <title>A Low&#8208;Acidity Chloride Electrolyte Enables Exceptional Reversibility and Stability in Aqueous Tin Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin (Sn) metal has emerged as a promising anode for aqueous batteries, due to its high capacity, non&#8208;toxicity, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, Sn metal has often been coupled with strong and corrosive sulfuric acids (2&#8208;3 M), leading to severe electrode corrosion and hydrogen evolution issues. Although high efficiency and long cycling were reported, the results were achieved using high currents to kinetically mask electrode&#8208;electrolyte side reactions. Herein, we introduce a low&#8208;acidity tin chloride electrolyte (pH=1.09) as a more viable option, which eliminates the need of strong acids and enables a reversible dendrite&#8208;free Sn plating chemistry. Remarkably, the plating efficiency approaches unity (99.97%) under standard testing conditions (1 mA cm&#8208;2 for 1 mAh cm&#8208;2), which maintains high at 99.23&#8208;99.93% across various aggressive conditions, including low current (0.1&#8208;0.25 mA cm&#8208;2), high capacity (5&#8208;10 mAh cm&#8208;2), and extended resting time (24&#8208;72 hours). The battery calendar life is further prolonged to 3064 hours, significantly surpassing literature reports. Additionally, we presented an effective method to mitigate the potential Sn2+ oxidization issue on the cathode, demonstrating long&#8208;cycling Sn||LiMn2O4 hybrid batteries. This work offers critical insights for developing highly reversible Sn metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Switching CO2 Electroreduction Pathways between Ethylene and Ethanol via Tuning Microenvironment of the Coating on Copper Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering the microenvironment of electrode surface is one of the effective means to tune the reaction pathways in CO2RR. In this work, we prepared copper nanofibers with conductive polypyrrole coating by polymerization of pyrrole using polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as template. As a result, the obtained copper nanofibers Cu/Cu2+1O/SHNC, exhibited a superhydrophobic surface, which demonstrated very high selectivity for ethanol with a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 66.5% at &#8208;1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in flow cell. However, the catalyst Cu/Cu2+1O/NC, which was prepared under the same conditions but without PVP, possessed a hydrophobic surface and exhibited high selectivity towards ethylene at the given potentials. The mechanism for switch of reaction pathways from ethylene to ethanol in CO2RR was studied. Incorporating pyrrolidone groups into the polymer coating results in the formation of a superhydrophobic surface. This surface weakens the hydrogen bonding interaction between interfacial water molecules and facilitates the transfer of CO2, thereby enhancing the local CO2/H2O ratio. The high coverage of *CO promotes the coupling of *CO and *CHO to form C2 intermediates, and reduces the reaction energy for the formation of *CHCHOH (ethanol path) at the interface. This ensures that the reaction pathway is directed towards ethanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Honeycomb&#8208;Structured IrOx Foam Platelets as the Building Block of Anode Catalyst Layer in PEM Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving robust long&#8208;term durability with high catalytic activity at low iridium loading remains one of great challenges for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Herein, we report the low&#8208;temperature synthesis of iridium oxide foam platelets comprising edge&#8208;sharing IrO6 octahedral honeycomb framework, and demonstrate the structural advantages of this material for multilevel tuning of anodic catalyst layer across atomic&#8208;to&#8208;microscopic scales for PEMWE. The integration of IrO6 octahedral honeycomb framework, foam&#8208;like texture and platelet morphology into a single material system assures the generation and exposure of highly active and stable iridium catalytic sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while facilitating the reduction of both mass transport loss and electronic resistance of catalyst layer. As a proof of concept, the membrane electrode assembly in single&#8208;cell PEMWE based on honeycomb&#8208;structured IrOx foam platelets, with a low iridium loading (~0.3 mgIr/cm2), is demonstrated to exhibit high catalytic activity at ampere&#8208;level current densities and to remain stable for more than 2000 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemically Promoted Functionalization of Postconsumer Poly(Methyl Methacrylate) and Poly(&#945;&#8208;Methylstyrene) for Bulk Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a methodology of post&#8208;polymerization functionalization to enable bulk depolymerization by chemically recycling to monomer utilizing mechanochemical macro&#8208;radical generation. When sonicated in the presence of a depolymerizable trigger, postconsumer PMMA and PAMS can achieve up to 82&#8201;% depolymerization. High&#8208;purity monomer is collected and used in new materials. This method of functionalization is particularly effective with Mn&gt;1&#8197;million kg/mol polymers, offering a sustainable solution for plastic waste management.







Abstract
We describe a methodology of post&#8208;polymerization functionalization to enable subsequent bulk depolymerization to monomer by utilizing mechanochemical macro&#8208;radical generation. By harnessing ultrasonic chain&#8208;scission in the presence of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide methacrylate (PhthMA), we successfully chain&#8208;end functionalize polymers to promote subsequent depolymerization in bulk, achieving up to 82 % depolymerization of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(&#945;&#8208;methylstyrene) (PAMS) within 30&#8197;min. This method of depolymerization yields a high&#8208;purity monomer that can be repolymerized. Moreover, as compared to the most common methods of depolymerization, this work is most efficient with ultra&#8208;high molecular weight (UHMW) polymers, establishing a method with the potential to address highly persistent, non&#8208;degradable all&#8208;carbon backbone plastic materials. Lastly, we demonstrate the expansion of this depolymerization method to commercial cell cast PMMA, achieving high degrees of depolymerization from post&#8208;consumer waste. This work is the first demonstration of applying PhthMA&#8208;promoted depolymerization strategies in homopolymer PMMA and PAMS prepared by conventional polymerization methods.

         <title>Controlling Protein Assembly with Superchaotropic Nano&#8208;Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In living systems, protein assemblies serve essential functions. Controlling their construction in biotechnology is challenging. We show that anionic boron clusters act as reversible molecular glue for proteins, forming 2D assemblies and preventing temperature denaturation of myoglobin. Nano&#8208;ion concentration controls assembly size with minimal impact on structures, introducing boron&#8208;based nano&#8208;ions as tools for protein assembly and stabilization.







Abstract
In living systems, protein assemblies have essential functions, serving as structural supports, transport highways for molecular cargo, and containers of genetic material. The construction of protein assemblies, which involves control over space and time, remains a significant challenge in biotechnology. Here, we show that anionic boron clusters, 3,3&#8242;&#8208;commo&#8208;bis[closo&#8208;1,2&#8208;dicarba&#8208;3&#8208;cobaltadodecaborane] (COSAN&#8722;), and halogenated closo&#8208;dodecarboranes (B12X122&#8722;, X=H, Cl, or I), described as super&#8208;chaotropic nano&#8208;ions, induce the formation of 2D assemblies of model proteins, myoglobin, carbonic anhydrase, and trypsin inhibitor. We found that the nano&#8208;ion concentration reversibly controls the size of the protein assemblies. Furthermore, the secondary structures of the proteins are only slightly affected by assembly formation. For myoglobin, the formation of these assemblies even prevents temperature denaturation, highlighting a preservation effect of nano&#8208;ions. Our study reveals that inorganic boron&#8208;based nano&#8208;ions act as a reversible molecular glue for proteins, providing a potential starting point for the further development of controlled protein assemblies.

         <title>Development of Organ Targeting Lipid Nanoparticles with Low Immunogenicity and Their Application in the Treatment of Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organ targeting lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with low immunogenicity were developed as novel gene delivery platforms by incorporating Dex (dLNPs) to alleviate side effects induced by traditional LNPs. Lung&#8208;targeting dLNPs delivered siRUNX1 for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis with superior therapeutic performance owing to the synergy of gene and drug therapy. They provide a blueprint for the design of RNA therapeutics with higher efficacy and safety.







Abstract
As the most advanced non&#8208;viral delivery system, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were approved by the FDA, propelling the advancements of gene therapy. However, their clinical applications are hampered by the potential immunogenicity of the lipid components that trigger immune&#8208;related adverse events, like inflammation and allergy. Herein, we formulate various dLNPs with diminished immunogenicity by incorporating dexamethasone (Dex) into liver&#8208;, spleen&#8208;, and lung&#8208;targeting LNPs formulations that exhibit excellent abilities to target specific organs and deliver various types of RNA, such as mRNA and siRNA. In vivo investigations demonstrate unparalleled advantages in safety as compared to conventional LNPs, showing promising potential in the development of RNA therapeutics. Intriguingly, the encapsulation of runt&#8208;related transcription factor&#8208;1 siRNA (siRUNX1) into lung&#8208;targeting dLNPs (dLNPs@siRUNX1) demonstrates remarkable advantages in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis through the synergy of gene therapy and drug therapy. This research establishes secure and universal platforms for the precise delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics, showcasing promising clinical applications in gene therapy.

         <title>A Deep&#8208;Red Emissive Sulfur&#8208;Doped Double [7]Helicene Photosensitizer: Synthesis, Structure and Chiral Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a deep&#8208;red emissive sulfur&#8208;doped double [7]helicene with a high photoluminescence yield and large Stokes shift, as well as aromatic behaviors of various oxidation states. Its chiroptical properties are also studied. High spin&#8208;orbit coupling constants between the singlet and triplet states enable the double helicene to act as an efficient singlet oxygen photosensitizer.







Abstract
Doping of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) with sulfur atoms is becoming more and more important as a means of creating unique functional materials. Recently, thiophene&#8208;containing multiple helicenes have garnered enormous attention due to their intriguing electronic and (chir)optical properties compared with carbohelicenes. However, the efficient synthesis of thiopyran&#8208;containing multiple helicenes and the underlying sulfur doping mechanisms are rather unexplored. Herein, the synthesis and structural analysis of a thiopyran&#8208;containing double [7]helicene 3 are reported. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals 3 and its dication with C2&#8208;symmetric propeller&#8208;shape structures and compact interactions in the solid state. 3 exhibits deep&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence emission. Tunable aromaticity of the central benzene ring and thiopyran rings is found by chemical oxidation, which is further confirmed by nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS), anisotropy of the induced current density (ACID) and harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA) analysis. Furthermore, the chiral and photosensitizing characters of 3 are investigated. The excellent deep&#8208;red to NIR fluorescence, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and photosensitizing activities suggest that 3 can be used as an outstanding photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and bioimaging, especially paving the way for future CPL&#8208;PDT and CPL&#8208;bio&#8208;probe applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doping of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) with sulfur atoms is becoming more and more important as a means of creating unique functional materials. Recently, thiophene-containing multiple helicenes have garnered enormous attention due to their intriguing electronic and (chir)optical properties compared with carbohelicenes. However, the efficient synthesis of thiopyran-containing multiple helicenes and the underlying sulfur doping mechanisms are rather unexplored. Herein, the synthesis and structural analysis of a thiopyran-containing double [7]helicene &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are reported. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and its dication with &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric propeller-shape structures and compact interactions in the solid state. &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; exhibits deep-red to near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence emission. Tunable aromaticity of the central benzene ring and thiopyran rings is found by chemical oxidation, which is further confirmed by nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS), anisotropy of the induced current density (ACID) and harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA) analysis. Furthermore, the chiral and photosensitizing characters of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are investigated. The excellent deep-red to NIR fluorescence, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and photosensitizing activities suggest that &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; can be used as an outstanding photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and bioimaging, especially paving the way for future CPL-PDT and CPL-bio-probe applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aldehyde End&#8208;Capped Degradable Polyethylenes From Hydrogen&#8208;Controlled Ethylene/CO Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from three large&#8208;scale feedstocks of ethylene + carbon monoxide + hydrogen, direct hydrogen&#8208;controlled non&#8208;alternating copolymerization of CO and ethylene produces aldehyde end&#8208;capped polyethylene (PE) materials with in&#8208;chain isolated keto group, whose molecular weight and chain endgroup could be modulated by H2. Such semicrystalline PE could undergo photodegradation to oily derivatives.







Abstract
To access degradable polyolefin plastic, non&#8208;alternating copolymerization of ethylene (E) and carbon monoxide (CO) for producing polyethylene (PE) with in&#8208;chain ketones is particularly appealing; however, it still presents significant challenges such as molecular weight modulation (hydrogen response) and chain endgroup control (functional terminal). In this study, we achieved hydrogen&#8208;controlled E/CO non&#8208;alternating copolymerization using late transition metal catalysts. This process results in linear PEs containing the desired non&#8208;alternating in&#8208;chain keto groups (1.0&#8211;9.3&#8197;mol&#8201;%) and with tunable molecular weights ranging from 43 to 195&#8197;kDa. In this reaction, H2 serves as a chain transfer agent, modulating the polymer's molecular weight, forming unique aldehyde endgroups and eliminating usual olefinic endgroups; CO undergoes non&#8208;alternating insertion into the PE chain, resulting in a strictly non&#8208;alternating structure (&gt;99&#8201;%) for the keto&#8208;PE. The dispersed incorporation of in&#8208;chain keto groups retains bulk properties of PE and makes PE susceptible to photodegradation, which produces significantly lower molecular weight polymers and oligomers with unambiguous vinyl and acetyl terminals.

         <title>Dual Redox&#8208;active Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;based Memristors for Highly&#8208;efficient Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a room&#8208;temperature single&#8208;phase method to synthesize highly crystalline covalent organic frameworks containing dual redox&#8208;active units. The synergistic effect of these units significantly reduces the redox energy barrier and improves the efficiency of neuromorphic computation.







Abstract
Organic memristors based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit significant potential for future neuromorphic computing applications. The preparation of high&#8208;quality COF nanosheets through appropriate structural design and building block selection is critical for the enhancement of memristor performance. In this study, a novel room&#8208;temperature single&#8208;phase method was used to synthesize Ta&#8722;Cu3 COF, which contains two redox&#8208;active units: trinuclear copper and triphenylamine. The resultant COF nanosheets were dispersed through acid&#8208;assisted exfoliation and subsequently spin&#8208;coated to fabricate a high&#8208;quality COF film on an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate. The synergistic effect of the dual redox&#8208;active centers in the COF film, combined with its distinct crystallinity, significantly reduces the redox energy barrier, enabling the efficient modulation of 128 non&#8208;volatile conductive states in the Al/Ta&#8722;Cu3 COF/ITO memristor. Utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on these 128 conductance states, image recognition for ten representative campus landmarks was successfully executed, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 95.13&#8201;% after 25 training epochs. Compared to devices based on binary conductance states, the memristor with 128 conductance states exhibits a 45.56&#8201;% improvement in recognition accuracy and significantly enhances the efficiency of neuromorphic computing.

         <title>From Cyclopropene to Housane Derivatives Via Intramolecular Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of housanes from cyclopropenes via highly strained intramolecular cyclopropanation is described. The reaction proceeds in synthetically useful yields and diastereoselectivity. Moreover, the application to the synthesis of unnatural housane&#8208;containing terpenoids is disclosed.







Abstract
The synthesis of housane derivatives from cyclopropenes is described. Under rhodium(II) catalysis, cyclopropenylvinyl carbinols can regioselectively generate a carbene intermediate which undergoes an intramolecular cyclopropanation to form a housane, a skeleton with similar ring strain as the cyclopropene precursor. The procedure shows a remarkable broad scope and efficiency. Moreover, the method served to prepare man&#8208;made housane&#8208;containing terpene derivatives, which are not accessible by Nature.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial water channels (AWCs) have been extensively explored to mimic natural proteins, which enables to effectively transport water while blocking ions. As one of the first AWCs, self&#8208;assembled I&#8208;quartets (HCx) have showcased high water&#8208;permselectivity that can be enhanced by improving their distribution and stability within membrane. The use of long alkyl chains (n&gt;8) is constrained by their low solubility and aggregation. Herein, we considered cycloalkyl moieties, explored for the increase of the solubility favoring enhanced partition and/ for their self&#8208;assembly behaviors resulting the formation of effective stable water&#8208;channels with increased water permeability in bilayer membranes. This class of cycloalkyl&#8208;ureido&#8208;ethyl&#8208;imidazole amphiphilic (CxUH) channel could serve as a new reference for the effective design of self&#8208;assembled artificial water channels, it may give rise to the applications in desalination or in water treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Organic Phosphorescence Glass by Rigid&#8208;Soft Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic phosphorescence glass has garnered considerable attention owing to the excellent shaping ability and photophysical behavior, but facile construction from single&#8208;component phosphors is still challenging. Herein, a rigid&#8208;soft coupling design is adopted in organic phosphors of ICO, CCO and PCO, thus preparing phosphorescence glasses through melting&#8208;quenching method to give excellent shaping ability and dynamic phosphorescence. RTP performance is significantly enhanced in the dense&#8208;structure glass, and intriguing high&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (HTP) is still observable even at 400 K. Direct patterning under UV irradiation is also achieved using photolithography technique, allowing for the creation of high&#8208;quality afterglow patterns that can be reversibly erased and rewritten. This rigid&#8208;soft conformation in organic phosphors elucidates a promising concept for achieving efficient RTP glass with wide application prospects.</dc:description>

         <title>How Can Materials Chemists Contribute to Food Supply Security in the Age of AI and Robotics?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Viewpoint describes the unexpected, underexplored, but essential ways in which the materials chemistry community can contribute to securing the global food supply as it is coming under increasing duress. The piece provides a large number of open fundamental questions for the community to tackle, as well as examples from the recent literature.







Abstract
Global factors are compromising the security of the food supply. Many of us in our community might be unsure about how to help with our seemingly inapplicable expertise. In this piece, I describe how materials chemistry and materials chemists will be essential in addressing this problem, but not only in the way we might think. There is a gigantic and largely unexplored opportunity for real societal impact if we accept a broader view of what academic materials chemistry can be.

         <title>Nonplanar Nanographene: A Hydrocarbon Hole&#8208;Transporting Material That Competes with Triarylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexabenzo[a,c,fg,j,l,op]tetracene (HBT), a small nonplanar nanographene, functions as a hydrocarbon HTM with hole transport properties that match those of triarylamine&#8208;based HTMs. A HBT&#8208;based OLED exhibited excellent performance, featuring superior curves for current density&#8211;voltage, external quantum efficiency&#8211;luminance, and lifetime as compared to those of representative triarylamine&#8208;based OLEDs.







Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) are essential for optoelectronic devices, such as organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells, and perovskite solar cells. Triarylamines have been employed as HTMs since they were introduced in 1987. However, heteroatoms or side chains embedded in the core skeleton of triarylamines can cause thermal and chemical stability problems. Herein, we report that hexabenzo[a,c,fg,j,l,op]tetracene (HBT), a small nonplanar nanographene, functions as a hydrocarbon HTM with hole transport properties that match those of triarylamine&#8208;based HTMs. X&#8208;ray structural analysis and theoretical calculations revealed effective multidirectional orbital interactions and transfer integrals for HBT. In&#8208;depth experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that the nonplanarity&#8208;inducing annulative &#960;&#8208;extension can achieve not only a stable amorphous state in bulk films, but also a higher increase in the highest occupied molecular orbital level than conventional linear or cyclic &#960;&#8208;extension. Furthermore, an in&#8208;house manufactured HBT&#8208;based OLED exhibited excellent performance, featuring superior curves for current density&#8211;voltage, external quantum efficiency&#8211;luminance, and lifetime compared to those of representative triarylamine&#8208;based OLEDs. A notable improvement in device lifetime was observed for the HBT&#8208;based OLED, highlighting the advantages of the hydrocarbon HTM. This study demonstrates the immense potential of small nonplanar nanographenes for optoelectronic device applications.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Size Control and Guest&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Heteroleptic Pd3A3B3 and Pd4A4B4 Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;statistical multicomponent assembly gives simple synthetic access to the first Pd3A3B3 bowls, capable of showing guest&#8208;induced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Adjustment of ligand angle or backbone functionality allows control over the ring size, yielding Pd4A4B4 bowls or saddle&#8208;type structures.







Abstract
Two new structural motifs within the class of heteroleptic PdnAnBn assemblies, namely syn&#8208;cis&#8208;Pd3A3B3 bowls and bowl&#8208; (syn) or saddle&#8208; (anti) shaped cis&#8208;Pd4A4B4 rings are introduced. All of the ten examples share a common longer fluorenone&#8208;based bis&#8208;monodentate ligand, equipped with meta&#8208;pyridine donor groups. The ring size (3&#8208; vs. 4&#8208;membered) and conformational preference (bowl vs. saddle) are controlled by the choice of the shorter ligand. These carry para&#8208;pyridine donors, different aromatic backbones (benzene, thiophene or selenophene) and either no or small or bulky endohedral substituents, serving to control the nuclearity of the heteroleptic rings through different effects (ligand angle, charge distribution or backbone bulk). Moreover, the luminescence of the fluorenone ligand is conserved in the formed architectures. Emission intensity as well as host&#8211;guest properties vary depending on the inward&#8208;pointing functions. All Pd3A3B3 assemblies are shown to bind chiral guest BINOL bis&#8208;sulfonate which imparts its chirality to the entire host&#8211;guest complex. This results in a guest&#8208;induced circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with dissymmetry factor glum up to 10&#8722;3.

         <title>Synthesis of 1&#8208;Azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes via Formal Single Electron Reduction of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes under Photochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general synthesis of 1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (1&#8208;aza&#8208;BCH) starting from azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABB) and styrenes under photochemical conditions is reported. The reaction follows a polar&#8208;radical&#8208;polar relay strategy in which the key step is a photocatalytic atom&#8208;transfer&#8208;radical&#8208;addition (ATRA) reaction.







Abstract
C(sp3)&#8208;rich heterocycles are privileged building blocks for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Therefore, synthetic methods that provide access to novel saturated nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles are in high demand. Herein, we report a general synthesis of 1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (1&#8208;aza&#8208;BCH) via a formal cycloaddition of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABB) with styrenes under photochemical conditions. To overcome the challenging direct single electron reduction of ABBs, we designed a polar&#8208;radical&#8208;polar relay strategy that leverages a fast acid&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening of ABBs to form bromoazetidines, which undergo efficient debrominative radical formation to initiate the cycloaddition reaction. The reaction is applicable to a broad range of ABB&#8208;ketones and we demonstrate the 1&#8208;aza&#8208;BCH products can be further functionalized to access larger saturated, conformationally rigid heterocycles.

         <title>Antiferromagnetic Ordering in A One&#8208;Dimensional Organic Copper Chloride Hybrid Insulator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;dimensional (1D) organic metal halide hybrid, (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6, has been synthesized and characterized for the first time, which exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering with a N&#233;el temperature of 24&#8197;K. This work paves novel pathways for developing functional low&#8208;dimensional organic metal halide hybrids for spintronics.







Abstract
Low dimensional (LD) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as new generation functional materials with exceptional structural and property tunability. Despite the remarkable advances in the development of LD OMHHs, optical properties have been the major functionality extensively investigated for most of LD OMHHs developed to date, while other properties, such as magnetic and electronic properties, remain significantly under&#8208;explored. Here, we report for the first time the characterization of the magnetic and electronic properties of a 1D OMHH, organic&#8208;copper (II) chloride hybrid (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6. Owing to the antiferromagnetic coupling between Cu atoms through chloride bridges in 1D [Cu2Cl62&#8722;]&#8734; chains, (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6 is found to exhibit antiferromagnetic ordering with a N&#233;el temperature of 24&#8197;K. The two&#8208;terminal (2T) electrical measurement on a (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6 single crystal reveals its insulating nature. This work shows the potential of LD OMHHs as a highly tunable quantum material platform for spintronics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low dimensional (LD) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as new generation functional materials with exceptional structural and property tunability. Despite the remarkable advances in the development of LD OMHHs, optical properties have been the major functionality extensively investigated for most of LD OMHHs developed to date, while other properties, such as magnetic and electronic properties, remain significantly under-explored. Here, we report for the first time the characterization of the magnetic and electronic properties of a 1D OMHH, organic-copper (II) chloride hybrid (C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Owing to the antiferromagnetic coupling between Cu atoms through chloride bridges in 1D [Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt; chains, (C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is found to exhibit antiferromagnetic ordering with a N&#233;el temperature of 24&#8197;K. The two-terminal (2T) electrical measurement on a (C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; single crystal reveals its insulating nature.

         <title>Boron Ylide Enables Stereoselective Construction of gem&#8208;Diborylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereoselective cyclopropanation of olefins with boron ylide is disclosed for the first time, providing a modular strategy for the synthesis of stereospecific diboryl&#8208;functionalized cyclopropanes. The chiral gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes are synthesized with excellent enantioselectivity with the aid of a chiral auxiliary. Based on the powerful transformable ability of boryl group, those challenging multi&#8208;quaternary carbon centers in cyclopropane units have been facilely constructed with excellent stereoselectivity. Control experiments indicate that the boryl groups are necessary for both chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity control.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical&#160;Material&#160;Rb2ScB3O6F2 Originated from Congruously Oriented [B3O6] Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration and research for deep&#8208;ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are of great significance for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lasers. This work is based on the excellent structural [B3O6] units which manipulate the excellent performances of famous commercial NLO crystal &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4 (&#946;&#8208;BBO) to explore new alternatives of deep&#8208;UV NLO materials. A deep&#8208;UV rare&#8208;earth metal borate fluoride Rb2ScB3O6F2 (RSBF) is successfully designed by combining the heterovalent ions substitution strategy, and fluorination strategy. Expectedly, RSBF exhibits an extremely short cutoff edge below 175 nm (189 nm for &#946;&#8208;BBO), and a moderate birefringence of 0.088 at 1064 nm. The shortest phase&#8208;matching (PM) wavelength of RSBF (&#955;PM = 182 nm) is shortened by 23 nm compared with &#946;&#8208;BBO (&#955;PM = 205 nm) due to the improvements in the chromatic dispersion and cutoff edge, and an experimental frequency&#8208;doubling effect 1.4&#215;KDP further suggests that RSBF can output a deep&#8208;UV harmonic laser. This work provides new sights from the original influencing factors for the rational and purposeful design of deep&#8208;UV NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrabroad Near Infrared Emitting Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphor converted light emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs) have revolutionized solid&#8208;state white lighting by replacing energy&#8208;inefficient filament&#8208;based incandescent lamps. However, such a pc&#8208;LED&#160;emitting ultrabroad near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiations still remains a challenge, primarily because of the lack of ultrabroad NIR emitting phosphors. To address this issue, we have prepared 2.5% W4+&#8208;doped and 2.8% Mo4+&#8208;doped Cs2Na0.95Ag0.05BiCl6 perovskites emitting ultrabroad NIR radiation with unprecedented spectral widths of 434 and 468 nm, respectively. Upon band&#8208;edge excitation, the soft lattice of the host exhibits broad self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission covering NIR&#8208;I (680 nm), which then nonradiatively excites the dopants. The &#960;&#8208;donor ligand Cl&#8315; reduces the energy of dopant d&#8208;d&#160;transitions emitting NIR&#8208;II with a peak at ~950 nm.&#160;Vibronic coupling broadens the dopant emission. The large spin&#8208;orbit coupling and local structural distortion might possibly enhance the dopant emission intensity, leading to an overall NIR photoluminescence quantum yield ~40%. The composite of our ultrabroad NIR phosphors with biodegradable polymer polylactic acid could be processed into free&#8208;standing films and 3D printed structures. Large (170&#160;&#215;&#160;170 mm2), robust, and thermally stable 3D printed pc&#8208;LED panels emit ultrabroad NIR radiation, demonstrating NIR imaging applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Eutectic Electrolyte for Flexible Wide&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries from &#8208;20 &#176;C to 70 &#176;C</title>

         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have attracted attention for grid applications due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and high security. However, their lifespan decreases&#160;at high temperatures due to declining interfacial stability and increased side reactions. To address these challenges, a ternary deep eutectic solvent&#8208;based flexible electrolyte, comprised of ZnClO4&#183;6H2O, butanedinitrile (BD), and LiCl in an amphoteric polymer matrix, was developed to enable wide&#8208;temperature ZIBs working from &#8208;20 &#176;C to 70 &#176;C. The interactions among BD, Li+, and zinc hydrate alongside the amphoteric groups on the polyelectrolyte matrix could effectively suppress the interfacial side reactions and Zn dendrites formation. Consequently, the symmetric Zn cell demonstrates exceptional stability across a wide&#8208;temperature range, with the ability to survive up to 2780 hours (1 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2) at 50 &#176;C. Furthermore, the flexible Zn||PANI battery can operate stably over 1000 cycles at 50 &#176;C, boasting an initial specific capacity of 124.8 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 and capacity retention rate of 87.9% (3 A&#183;g&#8208;1). This work presents an effective strategy for designing high&#8208;stability energy storage devices with excellent security features that can function reliably across diverse temperature conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Rare Earth Er&#8208;Nd Dual Single&#8208;Atomic Catalysts for Efficient Visible&#8208;light Induced CO2 Reduction to CnH2n+1OH (n=1, 2)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient synthesis of CnH2n+1OH (n=1, 2) via photochemical CO2 reduction holds promise for achieving carbon neutrality but remains challenging. Here, we present rare&#8208;earth dual single atoms (SAs) catalysts containing ErN6 and NdN6 moieties, fabricated via an atom&#8208;confinement and coordination method. The dual Er&#8208;Nd SAs catalysts &#160;exhibit unprecedented generation rates of 1761.4 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 and 987.7 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 for CH3CH2OH and CH3OH, respectively. Through a combination of theoretical calculation, X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structural analysis, aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy, and in&#8208;situ FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the Er SAs facilitate charge transfer, serving as active centers for C&#8722;C bond formation, while Nd SAs provide the necessary *CO for C&#8722;C coupling in C2H5OH synthesis under visible light. Furthermore, the experiment and density functional theory calculation elucidate that the variety of electronic states induced by 4f orbitals of the Er SAs and the p&#8722;f orbital hybridization of Er&#8722;N moieties enable the formation of charge&#8208;transfer channel. Therefore, this study sheds light on the pivotal role of *CO adsorption in achieving efficient conversion from CO2 to CnH2n+1OH (n=1, 2) via a novel rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based dual SAs photocatalysis approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Crystalline and Enantiomerically Pure Helicenes with Open&#8208;Shell Singlet Ground States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicene diradical derivatives have attracted widespread attentions because of their unique magnetic and chiroptoelectronic properties, however, crystalline and enantiomerically pure forms of helicene diradicals are extremely rare. Herein, we describe the rational design and synthesis of o&#8208;quinone functionalized helicene diradicals with crystalline enantiomerical purity. Diradical dianion salt Rac&#8208;3K and its enantiomers P/M&#8208;3K were obtained by reduction of corresponding precursors Rac&#8208;3 and P/M&#8208;3 with two equivalent potassium graphite in THF in the presence of (di)benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6. Neutral dioxoborocyclic helicene diradicals (Rac&#8208;3B and P/M&#8208;3B) were produced by reactions of Rac&#8208;3 or P/M&#8208;3 with chlorobis(perfluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)2Cl. Crystal structures of compounds Rac&#8208;3K, Rac&#8208;3B and P/M&#8208;3K were obtained by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Their open&#8208;shell singlet state ground states were confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements and theoretical calculations. Their chiroptical properties were investigated by the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy. This work provides the first examples of enantiopure helicene diradical dianions and boron&#8208;containing helicene diradicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production with Key Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen represents a clean and sustainable energy source with wide applications in fuel cells and hydrogen energy storage systems. Photocatalytic strategies emerge as a green and promising solution for hydrogen production, which still reveals several critical challenges in enhancing the efficiency and stability and improving the whole value. This review systematically elaborates on various coupling approaches for photocatalytic hydrogen production, aiming to improve both efficiency and value through different oxidation half&#8208;reactions. Firstly, the fundamental mechanism is discussed for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Then, the advances, challenges, and opportunities are expanded for the coupling of photocatalytic hydrogen production, which focuses on the integration of value&#8208;added reactions including O2 production, H2O2 production, biomass conversion, alcohol oxidation, and pollutants treatment. Finally, the challenges and outlook of photocatalytic H2 production technology are analyzed from the aspects of coupling hydrogen production value, photocatalyst design and reaction system construction. This work presents a holistic view of the field, emphasizing the synergistic benefits of coupled reactions and their practical application potential, rather than focusing on catalysts or single reaction systems. This review provides valuable references for the development and application of photocatalytic hydrogen production in energy conversion and environmental conservation through sustainable, eco&#8208;friendly and economic pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Organic Solar Cells to Over 18&#8201;% Efficiency through Dipole&#8208;Dipole Interactions in Fluorinated Nonfused Ring Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing dipole&#8208;dipole interactions, NFREA 412&#8208;6F with halogen atoms exhibit exceptional crystallinity and improved charge transport. The D18&#8201;:&#8201;412&#8208;6F blend in OSCs shows enhanced efficiency over 18&#8201;%. 412&#8208;6F&#8242;s lower MOC compared to Y6 underscores its cost&#8208;effectiveness. This innovative approach in non&#8208;covalent forces yields a high&#8208;performance electron acceptor for superior photovoltaic outcomes.







Abstract
This study successfully designed and synthesized two nonfused ring electron acceptors, 412&#8208;6F and 412&#8208;6Cl, modified with fluorine and chlorine substituents, respectively. Single&#8208;crystal analysis revealed that 412&#8208;6F possesses a planar molecular backbone and exhibits pronounced dipole&#8208;dipole interactions between the fluorine atoms on the lateral phenyl groups and the carbonyl oxygen atoms on the end groups. This specific interaction promotes dense end&#8208;group stacking, leading to a reduced interlayer spacing. Improved crystallinity and coherence length are observed in the D18&#8201;:&#8201;412&#8208;6F blend film. Conversely, 412&#8208;6Cl adopts a more distorted configuration and lacks these interactions. As a result, the organic solar cell (OSC) based on D18&#8201;:&#8201;412&#8208;6F achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 18.03&#8201;%, surpassing the performance of the D18&#8201;:&#8201;412&#8208;6Cl OSC. This underscores the importance of designing novel acceptors with beneficial intermolecular interactions to enhance OSC efficiency, thus providing a new direction for organic photovoltaic advancement.

         <title>Indazole to 2&#8208;Cyanoindole Scaffold Progression for Mycobacterial Lipoamide Dehydrogenase Inhibitors Achieves Extended Target Residence Time and Improved Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Cyanoindole Lpd inhibitors make critical contacts inside substrate lipoamide binding site to ensure induced fit tight binding and long residence time via Asn382 and Asn463. Asn463 is H&#8208;bonded with Tyr16 to maintain its favorable configuration. Mutations in any of these 3 residues lining the pocket result in inhibitor losing the induced fit interaction and long residence.







Abstract
Tuberculosis remains a leading cause of death from a single infection worldwide. Drug resistance to existing and even new antimycobacterials calls for research into novel targets and unexplored mechanisms of action. Recently we reported on the development of tight&#8208;binding inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) lipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd), which selectively inhibit the bacterial but not the human enzyme based on a differential modality of inhibitor interaction with these targets. Here we report on the striking improvement in inhibitor residence time on the Mtb enzyme associated with scaffold progression from an indazole to 2&#8208;cyanoindole. Cryo&#8208;EM of Lpd with the bound 2&#8208;cyanoindole inhibitor 19 confirmed displacement of the buried water molecule deep in the binding channel with a cyano group. The ensuing hours&#8208;long improvement in on&#8208;target residence time is associated with enhanced antibacterial activity in axenic culture and in primary mouse macrophages. Resistance to 2&#8208;cyanoindole inhibitors involves mutations within the inhibitor binding site that have little effect on inhibitor affinity but change the modality of inhibitor&#8208;target interaction, resulting in fast dissociation from Lpd. These findings underscore that on&#8208;target residence time is a major determinant of antibacterial activity and in vivo efficacy.

         <title>Toggling the Oxygen Affinity between Anthracenes and Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet oxygen reacts selectively with pyridylanthracenes or naphthalenes, allowing switching between both units in a dyad. Four different stages can be addressed by a combination of protonation, oxidation, and thermolysis. Furthermore, optical spectroscopy offers a simple read&#8208;out method.







Abstract
We present the design of an anthracenyl&#8211;naphthyl (ANT&#8208;NAPH) dyad and its application as a luminescent 4&#8208;stage photo switch. Both segments can individually react with singlet oxygen to switch off an optical response. In their initial form the larger ANT component reacts significantly faster and thus an ANTO2&#8208;NAPH stage is turned on, observed by optical response of the remaining NAPH. To reduce its reactivity, ANT is substituted with two pyridine rings. This concept is first investigated and quantified on ANT and NAPH as separated molecules. Upon protonation the reaction of ANT becomes significantly slower. For the three possible pyridyl isomers this effect increases along the order meta&lt;para&lt;ortho. With the pyridyl nitrogen in ortho position the reaction completely toggles from ANT to NAPH. Application of this concept on the dyad allows to turn on the ANT&#8208;NAPHO2 stage with optical response of the remaining ANT. The sequence of protonation&#8208;oxygenation&#8208;neutralization is thereby the only possible way to isolate the unfavored form ANT&#8208;NAPHO2. In the dyad ANT and NAPH are directly attached and their coupling constitutes a non&#8208;oxygenated third stage, where the NAPH luminescence is quenched and ANT luminescence is enhanced. Reaction of both NAPH and ANT to ANTO2&#8208;NAPHO2 constitutes the fourth dark stage.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Euphordraculoate A and Pedrolide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric total syntheses of euphordraculoate A and pedrolide were accomplished through a cascade involving Eu&#8208;promoted dienyl enolization, intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, and enol&#8208;ketone tautomerization. This cascade is consistent with our proposal for the biogenetic relationship between euphordraculoate A and pedrolide.







Abstract
Here we report the asymmetric total syntheses of two rearranged tigliane diterpenoids, euphordraculoate A and pedrolide. A reductive dihydroxylation cascade and Nazarov cyclization were performed to generate euphordraculoate A, which was subjected to a cascade of Eu&#8208;promoted dienyl enolization, intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and enol&#8208;ketone tautomerization to afford pedrolide, a pathway consistent with our proposal for the biogenesis of pedrolide.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Boroxine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boroxine&#8208;based COFs including 3D COF&#8208;102 with high porosity, are now accessible by simple, efficient, and rapid mechanochemical synthesis, in a process amenable to in situ monitoring and multi&#8208;gram scale&#8208;up.







Abstract
We report a rapid, room&#8208;temperature mechanochemical synthesis of 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;dimensional boroxine covalent organic frameworks (COFs), enabled by using trimethylboroxine as a dehydrating additive to overcome the hydrolytic sensitivity of boroxine&#8208;based COFs. The resulting COFs display high porosity and crystallinity, with COF&#8208;102 being the first example of a mechanochemically prepared 3D COF, exhibiting a surface area of ca. 2,500&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. Mechanochemistry enabled a&gt;20&#8208;fold reduction in solvent use and ~100&#8208;fold reduction in reaction time compared with solvothermal methods, providing target COFs quantitatively with no additional work&#8208;up besides vacuum drying. Real&#8208;time Raman spectroscopy permitted the first quantitative kinetic analysis of COF mechanosynthesis, while transferring the reaction design to Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM) enabled synthesis of multi&#8208;gram amounts of the target COFs (tested up to 10&#8197;g).

         <title>Programmable Chemical Evolution with Natural/Non&#8208;Natural Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To explore the combinatorial space of peptidomimetics with a broad selection of building blocks, not limited to the 20&#8197;natural amino acids, we have developed a chemical evolution process. Ancestral molecules can be generated by screening an initial library with representative building blocks. Unbiased random mutagenesis in natural evolution was replaced by the chemoinformatics&#8208;based design of iteration cycles. We can generate tens of thousands of mutations and explore an expansive combinatory space exceeding 1017, allowing the discovery of high&#8208;affinity binders within 2&#8211;4&#8197;generations.







Abstract
Non&#8208;natural building blocks (BBs) present a vast reservoir of chemical diversity for molecular recognition and drug discovery. However, leveraging evolutionary principles to efficiently generate bioactive molecules with a larger number of diverse BBs poses challenges within current laboratory evolution systems. Here, we introduce programmable chemical evolution (PCEvo) by integrating chemoinformatic classification and high&#8208;throughput array synthesis/screening. PCEvo initiates evolution by constructing a diversely combinatorial library to create ancestral molecules, streamlines the molecular evolution process and identifies high&#8208;affinity binders within 2&#8211;4&#8197;cycles. By employing PCEvo with 108 BBs and exploring &gt;1017 chemical space, we identify bicyclic peptidomimetic binders against targets SAR&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD and Claudin18.2, achieving nanomolar affinity. Remarkably, Claudin18.2 binders selectively stain gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines and patient samples. PCEvo achieves expedited evolution in a few rounds, marking a significant advance in utilizing non&#8208;natural building blocks for rapid chemical evolution applicable to targets with or without prior structural information and ligand preference.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Gradient Concentration Distribution in Sb&#8722;Cu Alloy Nanoarrays for Robust Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D coral&#8208;like alloy nanoarray featuring decreasing Sb and increasing Cu concentrations from bottom to top has been established. The former endows high capacity, while the latter acts as a protective layer maintaining high stability at the electrolyte/electrode interface. It also facilitates smooth distribution and release of stress, thereby exhibiting superior cycling stability and high&#8208;rate capability for sodium storage.







Abstract
Alloy&#8208;type materials are attractive for anodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacities and overall performance. However, the accumulation of stress/strain during repeated cycling results in electrode pulverization, leading to rapid capacity decay and eventual disintegration, thus hindering their practical applications. Herein, we report a 3D coral&#8208;like Sb&#8722;Cu alloy nanoarray with gradient distribution of both elements. The array features a Sb&#8208;rich bottom and a Cu&#8208;rich top with increasing Sb and decreasing Cu concentrations from top to bottom. The former is the active component that provides the high capacity, whereas the latter serves as an inert additive that acts against volume variation. The gradual transition in composition within the electrode introduces a ladder&#8208;type volume expansion effect, facilitating a smooth distribution and effective release of stress, thereby ensuring the wanted mechanical stability and structural integrity. The as&#8208;developed nanoarray affords a high reversible capacity (460&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C), stable cycling (89&#8201;% retention over 120&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C), and superior rate capability (354&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;C). The concentration dual&#8208;gradient strategy paves a new pathway of designing alloy&#8208;type materials for
SIBs.

         <title>Efficient Self&#8208;Sorting Behaviours of Metallacages with Subtle Structural Differences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we elucidated the unusual and efficient self&#8208;sorting behaviour of metallacages with subtle structural differences in batch reactors and microdroplets. The volume confinement and efficient mixing effects within microdroplets accelerate the self&#8208;sorting of metallacages in microdroplets compared to the same self&#8208;sorting in batch reactors.







Abstract
Investigating the self&#8208;sorting behaviour of assemblies with subtle structural differences is a captivating yet challenging endeavour. Herein, we elucidate the unusual self&#8208;sorting behaviour of metallacages with subtle structural differences in batch reactors and microdroplets. Narcissistic self&#8208;sorting of metallacages has been observed for two ligands with identical sizes, shapes, and symmetries, with only minor differences in the substituted groups. In particular, the self&#8208;sorting process in microdroplets occurs within 1&#8197;min at room temperature, in stark contrast to batch reactors, which require equilibration for 30&#8197;min. To reveal the mechanism of self&#8208;sorting and the role of microdroplets, we conducted a series of experiments and theoretical calculations, including competitive self&#8208;assembly, cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation, control experiments involving model metallacages with larger cavities, noncovalent interaction analysis, and root mean square deviation (RMSD) analysis. This research demonstrates an unusual case of self&#8208;sorting of very similar assemblies and provides a new strategy for facilitating the self&#8208;sorting efficiency of supramolecular systems.

         <title>Chiral Ligand&#8208;Decorated Rhodium Nanoparticles Incorporated in Covalent Organic Framework for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tiny Rh nanoparticles (NPs) are encapsulated in a covalent organic framework and then decorated with chiral diene ligands to create chiral microenvironment for asymmetric 1,4&#8208;addition reactions between arylboronic acids and nitroalkenes. The results demonstrate that decorating the Rh NPs with ligands initiates activity, and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between the ligand and the substrate are crucial for achieving high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
While metal nanoparticles (NPs) have demonstrated their great potential in catalysis, introducing chiral microenvironment around metal NPs to achieve efficient conversion and high enantioselectivity remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. In this work, tiny Rh NPs, modified by chiral diene ligands (Lx) bearing diverse functional groups, are incorporated into a covalent organic framework (COF) for the asymmetric 1,4&#8208;addition reactions between arylboronic acids and nitroalkenes. Though Rh NPs hosted in the COF are inactive, decorating Rh NPs with Lx creates the active Rh&#8722;Lx interface and induces high activity. Moreover, chiral microenvironment modulation around Rh NPs by altering the groups on chiral diene ligands greatly optimizes the enantioselectivity (up to 95.6&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic investigations indicate that the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between Lx and nitroalkenes plays critical roles in the resulting enantioselectivity. This work highlights the significance of chiral microenvironment modulation around metal NPs by chiral ligand decoration for heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Engineered Cellular Vesicles Displaying Glycosylated Nanobodies for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell vesicles displaying high&#8208;mannose modified anti&#8208;CD47 nanobody enable the boost of macrophage&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity for enhanced cancer suppression by synergizing the checkpoint blockade and glycan&#8208;mediated interactions.







Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade targeting the CD47/SIRP&#945; axis represents an alluring avenue for cancer immunotherapy. However, the compromised efficacy and safety concerns in vivo of conventional anti&#8208;CD47 antibodies impede their wide clinical applications. Here we introduced a single type of high&#8208;mannose glycans into the nanobody against CD47 (HM&#8208;nCD47) and subsequently displayed HM&#8208;nCD47 on cellular vesicles (CVs) for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. In this platform, the CVs significantly improved the circulation time of HM&#8208;nCD47&#8208;CVs, the nCD47 enabled the blockade of the CD47/SIRP&#945; axis, and the HM enhanced recognition of mannose&#8208;binding lectin, all synergistically activating the macrophage&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity. In both subcutaneous and metastatic murine tumor models, the HM&#8208;nCD47&#8208;CVs possessed significantly extended half&#8208;lives and increased accumulation at the tumor site, resulting in a remarkable macrophage&#8208;dependent inhibition of tumor growth, a transcriptomic remodeling of the immune response, and an increase in survival time. By integrating the chemical biology toolbox with cell membrane nanotechnology, the HM&#8208;nCD47&#8208;CVs represent a new immunotherapeutic platform for cancer and other diseases.

         <title>Ambient Synthesis of Vanadium&#8208;Based Prussian Blue Analogues Nanocubes for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with Eutectic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The V&#8208;PBA cathode, prepared by in situ growth and conversion strategy, with eutectic electrolyte (5.55&#8197;M glucose and 3&#8197;M Zn(OTf)2 could maintain 55&#8201;% of the highest discharge specific capacity after 10000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study provides a new strategy to prepare pure PBA nanostructures and a new direction to enhance the long&#8208;term cycling stability of PBA&#8208;based AZIBs at high current density for industrialization prospects.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely studied in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to the characteristics of large specific surface area, open aperture, and straightforward synthesis. In this work, vanadium&#8208;based PBA nanocubes were firstly prepared using a mild in situ conversion strategy at room temperature without the protection of noble gas. Benefiting from the multiple&#8208;redox active sites of V3+/V4+, V4+/V5+, and Fe2+/Fe3+, the cathode exhibited an excellent discharge specific capacity of 200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in AZIBs, which is much higher than those of other metal&#8208;based PBAs nanocubes. To further improve the long&#8208;term cycling stability of the V&#8208;PBA cathode, a high concentration water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolyte (4.5&#8197;M ZnSO4+3&#8197;M Zn(OTf)2), and a water&#8208;based eutectic electrolyte (5.55&#8197;M glucose+3&#8197;M Zn(OTf)2) were designed to successfully inhibit the dissolution of vanadium and improve the deposition of Zn2+ onto the zinc anode. More importantly, the assembled AZIBs maintained 55&#8201;% of their highest discharge specific capacity even after 10000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with superior rate capability. This study provides a new strategy for the preparation of pure PBA nanostructures and a new direction for enhancing the long&#8208;term cycling stability of PBA&#8208;based AZIBs at high current densities for industrialization prospects.

         <title>Coordination Environment and Distance Optimization of Dual Single Atoms on Fluorine&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanotubes for Chlorine Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platinum dual single&#8208;atom catalyst (DSAC) dispersed on fluorine&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes was designed for an efficient and robust chlorine evolution reaction (CER) process. The prepared Pt DSAC exhibits excellent CER performance that outperforms that of the commercial dimensionally stable anode and Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst.







Abstract
The chlorine evolution reaction (CER) is a crucial anode reaction in the chlor&#8208;alkali industrial process. Precious metal&#8208;based dimensionally stable anodes (DSA) are commonly used as catalysts for CER but are constrained by their high cost and low selectivity. Herein, a Pt dual singe&#8208;atom catalyst (DSAC) dispersed on fluorine&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (F&#8208;CNTs) is designed for an efficient and robust CER process. The prepared Pt DSAC demonstrates excellent CER activity with a low overpotential of 21&#8197;mV to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a remarkable mass activity of 3802.6&#8197;A&#8201;gpt&#8722;1 at an overpotential around 30&#8197;mV, outperforming those of commercial DSA and Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst. The excellent CER performance of Pt DSAC is attributed to the high atomic utilization and improved intrinsic activity. Notably, introducing fluorine atoms on CNTs increases the oxidation and chlorination resistance of Pt DSAC, and reduces the demetalization ratio of Pt atoms, resulting in excellent long&#8208;term CER stability. Theoretical calculations reveal that several Pt DSAC configurations with optimized first&#8208;shell ligands and interatomic distance display lower energy barriers for Cl intermediates generation and weaker ionic Pt&#8722;Cl bond interaction, which are favorable for the CER process.

         <title>Main&#8208;Group Metal&#8208;Nonmetal Dynamic Proton Bridges Enhance Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A main&#8208;group metal&#8208;nonmetal proton bridge catalyst (O&#8722;In&#8722;S), featuring the In&#8722;S polarization pair as asymmetric dual&#8208;sites and electronegative oxygen as an electron pool, enables the asymmetric In&#8722;S dual&#8208;sites to back&#8208;donate electrons to the &#960;x* and &#960;y* antibonding orbitals of nitrogen (N2), achieving exceptional N2 fixation activity. This discovery paves the way for efficient electrocatalysts for activating inert molecules.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is a crucial process for the sustainable production of ammonia (NH3) for energy and agriculture applications. However, the reaction's efficiency is highly dependent on the activation of the inert N&#8801;N bond, which is hindered by the electron back&#8208;donation to the &#960;* orbitals of the N&#8801;N bond, resulting in low eNRR capacity. Herein, we report a main&#8208;group metal&#8208;nonmetal (O&#8722;In&#8722;S) eNRR catalyst featuring a dynamic proton bridge, with In&#8722;S serving as the polarization pair and O functioning as the dynamic electron pool. In situ spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the In&#8722;S polarization pair acts as asymmetric dual&#8208;sites, polarizing the N&#8801;N bond by concurrently back&#8208;donating electrons to both the &#960;x* and &#960;y* orbitals of N2, thereby overcoming the significant band gap limitations, while inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, the O dynamic electron pool acts as a &#8220;repository&#8221; for electron storage and donation to the In&#8722;S polarization pair. As a result, the O&#8722;In&#8722;S dynamic proton bridge exhibits exceptional NH3 yield rates and Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) across a wide potential window of 0.3&#8197;V, with an optimal NH3 yield rate of 80.07&#177;4.25&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 and an FE of 38.01&#177;2.02&#8201;%, outperforming most previously reported catalysts.

         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and characterization of a [2]rotaxane comprising a dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) macrocyclic component and a thread containing three recognition sites: ammonium (AmH+), bipyridinium (Bpy2+) and triazolium (Trz+). AmH+ and Bpy2+ are responsive to fully orthogonal stimuli, pH and electrochemical, which allows to precisely control the directional translation of the macrocycle along the axle. A better understanding of the processes driving the operation of the system was obtained thanks to an in&#8208;depth thermodynamic characterization. Orthogonal stimuli responsive tristable rotaxanes represent the starting point for the creation of linear motors and the development of molecular logic gates.</dc:description>

         <title>A CaI2&#8208;Based Electrolyte Enabled by Borate Ester Anion Receptors for Reversible Ca&#8208;Organic and Ca&#8208;Se Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Passivating solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) in Ca metal anodes constitute a long&#8208;standing challenge, as they block Ca2+ transport and inhibit reversible Ca deposition/stripping. Current solutions focus primarily on boron/aluminum&#8208;based electrolytes to mitigate such interfacial issues by producing Ca2+&#8208;conductive species, yet the complex synthetic procedure of these salts restricts the widespread application. Moreover, whether any inorganic phases possess decent Ca2+ conductivity within SEIs remains ambiguous. Herein, we report that a commercially available CaI2&#8208;dimethoxyethane electrolyte supports reversible Ca/Ca2+ redox reactions via forming CaI2&#8208;involved SEI, inspired by our density functional theory calculations where CaI2 species is predicted to possess the lowest Ca2+ diffusion barrier among a range of inorganic phases. We further materialize this finding by introducing a serial of borate ester anion receptors, resulting in the formation of CaI2/borides hybrid SEIs with an enhanced Ca2+ conductivity. Consequently, the resultant electrolytes realize a 7&#8208;fold reduction in deposition/stripping overpotential compared to anion receptor&#8208;free one, allowing for the construction of reversible Ca&#8208;metal full cells with high&#8208;capacity selenium and organic cathodes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bifunctional catalase&#8208;peroxidase (KatG) features a posttranslational methionine&#8208;tyrosine&#8208;tryptophan (MYW) crosslinked cofactor crucial for its catalase function, enabling pathogens to neutralize hydrogen peroxide during infection. We discovered the presence of indole nitrogen&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl adduct (MYW&#8208;OOH) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis KatG in the solution state under ambient conditions, suggesting its natural occurrence. By isolating predominantly MYW&#8208;OOH&#8208;containing KatG protein, we investigated the chemical stability and functional impact of MYW&#8208;OOH. We discovered that MYW&#8208;OOH inhibits catalase activity, presenting a unique temporary lock. Exposure to peroxide or increased temperature removes the hydroperoxyl adduct from the protein cofactor, converting MYW&#8208;OOH to MYW and restoring the detoxifying ability of the enzyme against hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the N&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl group is releasable. KatG with MYW&#8208;OOH represents a catalase dormant, but primed, state of the enzyme. These findings provide insight into chemical strategies targeting the bifunctional enzyme KatG in pathogens, highlighting the role of N&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl modifications in enzymatic function.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Fluorinated&#8208;ethers are promising electrolyte solvents in lithium metal batteries, for their high antioxidant and excellent reductive stability on Li anode. However, fluorinated&#8208;ethers with high fluorination degree suffer from low ionic conductivity and narrow temperature adaptibility. Herein, we synthesize a mono&#8208;fluorinated linear ether of bis(2&#8208;fluoroethoxy) methane (BFME) with enhanced solvated ability. The &#8208;OCH2O&#8208; structure and fluoride substitution on the&#160;&#946;&#8208;C position endows the BFME electrolyte with moderate affinity to Li+, thereby improving the ionic conductivity and decreasing the Li+&#8208;desolvation energy barrier at a wide temperature range of &#8208;60 &#822; 60&#160;oC. Additionally, the electrolyte with anion&#8208;participated solvation structure demonstrates high film&#8208;forming ability by forming LiF&#8208;rich interfacial film on the electrode surfaces, rendering the graphite anode with an initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 94.9% and a Li plating/stripping CE of 99.8% by Aurbach method. Consequently, the Graphite||LiFePO4&#160;pouch cells delivered 83.2%, 92.5% and 81.2% capacity retention after 1250, 200 and 300 cycles at 25, &#8208;20&#160;oC and 60&#160;oC, respectively. Moreover, the Li||LFP pouch cell with 3 Ah capacity can operate for 65 cycles with 99% capacity retention, verifying the effectiveness of the BFME electrolyte in stabilizing the interfaces and broadening the temperature adaptibility of lithium&#8208;ion and lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of photocatalytic systems that enable the simultaneous production of H2O2 and value&#8208;added organic chemicals presents a dual advantage: generating valuable products while maximizing the utilization of solar energy. Despite the potential, there are relatively few reports on photocatalysts capable of such dual functions. In this study, we synthesized a series of donor&#8208;acceptor covalent organic frameworks (COFs), designated as JUC&#8208;675 to JUC&#8208;677, to explore their photocatalytic efficiency in the co&#8208;production of H2O2 and N&#8208;benzylbenzaldimine (BBAD). Among them, JUC&#8208;675 exhibited exceptional performance, achieving a H2O2 production rate of 22.8 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum yield of 15.7%, and its solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency was calculated to be 1.09%, marking it as the most effective COF&#8208;based photocatalyst reported to date. Additionally, JUC&#8208;675 demonstrated a high selectivity (99.9%) and yield (96%) for BBAD in the oxidative coupling of benzylamine. The underlying reaction mechanism was thoroughly investigated through validation experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work represents a significant advancement in the design of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and the development of efficient dual&#8208;function photocatalytic platforms, offering new insights and methodologies for enhanced solar energy utilization and the synthesis of value&#8208;added products.</dc:description>

         <title>A Customized Strategy Realizes Stable Cycle of Large&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Voltage Layered Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;voltage P2&#8208;Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 layered oxide cathode exhibits significant potential for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, owing to the elevated operating voltage and theoretical energy density beyond lithium iron phosphate, but the large&#8208;volume phase transition is the devil. Currently, this type cathode still suffers from stability&#8211;capacity trade&#8208;off dilemma. Herein, a concept of customized strategy via multiple rock&#8208;forming elements trace doping is presented to address the mentioned issue. The customized Mg&#8208;Al&#8208;Ti trace doped cathode maintains a notable capacity of 140.3 mAh g &#8722;  1 with an energy density approaching 500 Wh kg &#8722;  1, and shows good cycle stability, retaining 89.0% of its capacity after 50 cycles at 0.1C. Additionally, the full cell, paired with a hard carbon anode, achieves an advanced energy density of 303.3 Wh kg&#8722;1. The multiple characterizations reveal the failure mechanism of contrast sample involving severe intragranular cracks coupled with layer to rock salt transformation, which reduces active substance and increases charge transfer resistance. The doped sample with increased sliding energy barrier well suppresses this phenomenon. Impressively, the customized strategy can be extended to Mg&#8208;Fe&#8208;Ti system. This research provides a novel concept for the design of high energy sodium&#8208;ion cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Disorder Over Pore Size: Boosting Supercapacitor Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The urgent need for efficient energy storage systems has spotlighted supercapacitors and nanostructured porous carbon materials, which require structural optimization to enhance their performance and lifespan, necessitating advanced design and synthesis techniques. Recent research by Forse et al. published in Science reveals that structural disorder in nanoporous carbon materials significantly enhances their capacitance performance, suggesting that optimizing structural disorder is key to developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density supercapacitors. This study innovatively shows that structural disorder in nanoporous carbon materials significantly enhances capacitance performance, surpassing traditional factors like pore size and surface area. The investigation of multiple nanoporous carbons from a range of different suppliers showcases the generalizability of the findings. Annealing treatment further confirms that the capacitance enhancement is due to structural disorder. This discovery guides the design and synthesis of new efficient electrode materials, providing a new direction for the future development of supercapacitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Wide Modulation and Reversible Reconfiguration of a Flexible Organic Crystalline Optical Waveguide Between 645 and 731 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible organic crystalline optical waveguides, i.e., delivering input or self&#8208;emit lights through various dynamic organic crystals, have attracted increasing attentions in the past decade. However, the modulation of waveguide outputs relies on chemical design and substituent modification, being time&#8208;consuming and laborious. Here we report an elastic organic crystal that displays long&#8208;distance light transducing capability up to 2.0 cm and ultra&#8208;wide modulation of crystalline optical waveguides between red (645 nm) and near infrared (731 nm) in both the pristine and the elastically bent states based on a pre&#8208;designed self&#8208;absorption effect. The flexible organic crystalline optical waveguides can be precisely and reversibly reconfigured by controlling irradiation point. In addition, deep red amplified spontaneous emissions (ASE) that are able to transduce through a 5.0 mm bent crystal with an ultra&#8208;low optical loss coefficient of 0.092 dB/mm has been attained. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of flexible organic ASE waveguides. The present study not only provides a simple yet effective strategy to remarkably modulate flexible organic crystalline optical waveguides but also demonstrates the superiority of laser over normal emission as flexible optical communication elements.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stage Optimization of Pore Size and Shape in Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Highly Selective and Sensitive Benzene Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to exploratory development of new structure types, pushing the limits of isoreticular synthesis on a high&#8208;performance MOF platform may have higher probability of achieving targeted properties. Multi&#8208;modular MOF platforms could offer even more opportunities by expanding the scope of isoreticular chemistry. However, navigating isoreticular chemistry towards best properties on a multi&#8208;modular platform is challenging due to multiple interconnected pathways. Here on the multi&#8208;modular pacs (partitioned acs) platform, we demonstrate accessibility to a new regime of pore geometry using two independently adjustable modules (framework&#8208;forming module 1 and pore&#8208;partitioning module 2). A series of new pacs materials have been made. Benzene/cyclohexane selectivity is tuned, progressively, from 4.5 to 15.6 to 195.4 and to 482.5 by pushing the boundary of the pacs platform towards the smallest modules known so far. The exceptional stability of these materials in retaining both porosity and single crystallinity enables single&#8208;crystal diffraction studies of different crystal forms (as&#8208;synthesized, activated, guest&#8208;loaded) that help reveal the mechanistic aspects of adsorption in pacs materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonconventional Fluorescent Non&#8208;Isocyanate Polyurethane Foams for Multipurpose Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent foams with interconnected pores are attractive for the detection and quantification of various products. However, many fluorescent probes are suffering from aggregation&#8208;caused fluorescence quenching in their solid/aggregated state, are costly, and/or not straightforward to incorporate in foams, limiting their utility for this application. Herein, non&#8208;isocyanate polyurethane foams, prepared by the simple water&#8208;induced self&#8208;blowing process, present a nonconventional fluorescence behaviour, i.e. they are intrinsically fluorescent with a multicolor emission without requiring ex&#8208;situ traditional fluorescent probes. These foams demonstrate utility for capturing&#8208;sensing gaseous formaldehyde (an emblematic indoor air pollutant), as well as for detecting and quantifying various metal ions (Fe2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Hg2+). They are also able to selectively sense tetracycline antibiotic in a ratiometric way with a high sensitivity. By exploiting the unique multicolor photoluminescent foam properties, a smartphone&#8208;compatible device is used for the facile antibiotic quantification. This nonconventional fluorescence behaviour is discussed experimentally and theoretically, and is mainly based on clusteroluminescence originating from multiple hydrogen bonding and hetero&#8208;atomic sub&#8208;luminophores, thus from aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens that are naturally present in the foams. This work illustrates that easily accessible non&#8208;conventional fluorescent NIPU foams characterized by a modular emission wavelength have an enormous potential for multiple substrates detection and quantification.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Resonance Quasi&#8208;fluorescence from BN&#8208;Doped Aromatic Compounds Modified with "Naphthalene" Units Approaches the BT.2020 Green Light Standard</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Creating fluorophores that meet the Broadcast Service Television 2020 (BT.2020) standard is a significant achievement. In this paper, we present an innovative strategy that could revolutionize the development of high&#8208;performance narrowband fluorophores for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. Our approach combines classic multi&#8208;resonance BN&#8208;doped fragments with naphthalene, creating two novel narrowband bright green quasi&#8208;fluorescent emitters, NT&#8208;2B and NT&#8208;3B. When tested in dilute toluene, these molecules exhibit emission peaks at 510 and 511 nm with extremely narrow FWHM values of 15 and 14 nm, respectively. Both molecules also demonstrate conventional fluorescence properties with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 85%. Notably, OLEDs containing NT&#8208;2B achieve a peak EQE of approximately 30% and  at a doping concentration of 5 wt.%, OLEDs based on NT&#8208;2B achieve a CIEy value of roughly 0.75, closely matching the BT.2020 standard.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Creating fluorophores that meet the Broadcast Service Television 2020 (BT.2020) standard is a significant achievement. In this paper, we present an innovative strategy that could revolutionize the development of high-performance narrowband fluorophores for ultra-high-definition displays. Our approach combines classic multi-resonance BN-doped fragments with naphthalene, creating two novel narrowband bright green quasi-fluorescent emitters, NT-2B and NT-3B. When tested in dilute toluene, these molecules exhibit emission peaks at 510 and 511 nm with extremely narrow FWHM values of 15 and 14 nm, respectively. Both molecules also demonstrate conventional fluorescence properties with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 85%. Notably, OLEDs containing NT-2B achieve a peak EQE of approximately 30% and  at a doping concentration of 5 wt.%, OLEDs based on NT-2B achieve a CIEy value of roughly 0.75, closely matching the BT.2020 standard.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single Exposed Zn (0002) Plane and Sustainable Zn&#8208;Oriented Growth Achieving Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To prevent dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction, directional epitaxial growth of Zn2+ ions on Zn anode, especially along the lowest&#8208;surface&#8208;energy Zn (0002) plane, is pursued for highly reversible zinc metal batteries (ZMBs). However, designing single Zn (0002) exposed anodes for sustained uniaxial crystalline orientation of Zn electroplating faces challenges. Herein, we propose an anode engineering that utilizes a low lattice mismatch substrate and ordered Zn2+ migration channels to modify Zn anodes with single (0002) surface exposure and sustainable Zn&#8208;oriented growth, yielding highly reversible ZMBs. A vapor&#8208;deposited metal&#8208;organic framework Cu3(C6O6)2 film on brass foil shows low lattice mismatch (4.24%) with electrodeposited Zn anodes, enabling the exposure of a single (0002) plane. Furthermore, the low desolvation energy (&#8722;1.36 eV) between solvated Zn2+ ions and the ordered porous Cu3(C6O6)2 film guides sustainable Zn&#8208;oriented nucleation along the Zn (0002) surface. Consequently, the Zn||Zn cells with brass&#8208;Cu3(C6O6)2 substrate shows a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.55% after 4,000 cycles at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. This work provides a new window to design highly reversible Zn metal anode with a single&#8208;exposed Zn (0002) plane and sustainable oriented growth for emerging ZMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst with Precise Structure and Extremely Exposed Active Site for Efficient H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts with precise structure and extremely high catalytic efficiency remain a fervent focus in the fields of materials chemistry and catalytic science. Herein, a nickel&#8208;substituted polyoxometalate (POM) {NiSb6O4(H2O)3[&#946;&#8208;Ni(hmta)SbW8O31]3}15&#8208; (NiPOM) with one extremely exposed nickel site [NiO3(H2O)3] was synthesized using the conventional aqueous method. The uniform dispersion of single nickel center with well&#8208;defined structure was facilely achieved by anchoring nanosized NiPOM on graphene oxide (GO). The resulting NiPOM/GO can couple with CdS photoabsorber for the construction of low&#8208;cost and ultra&#8208;efficient hydrogen evolution system. The H2 yield can reach to 2753.27 mmol gPOM&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which represents a record value among all the POM&#8208;based photocatalytic systems. Remarkablely, an extremely high hydrogen yield of 3647.28 mmol gPOM&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 was achieved with simultaneous photooxidation of commercial waste plastic, representing the first POM&#8208;based photocatalytic system for H2 evolution and waste plastic conversion. This work highlights a straightforward strategy for constructing extremely exposed single&#8208;metal site with precise microenvironment by facilely manipulating nanosized molecular cluster to control individual atom.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conversion of quinoline C&#8208;H bonds to C&#8208;C bonds is essential for obtaining the enormous array of derivatives required for pharmaceutical and agrochemical development. Despite over a century of synthetic efforts, the direct alkylation and alkenylation at C3&#8208;H positions in a wide array of quinoline precursors remain predominantly challenging and elusive. This report outlines the first successful quinoline C3&#8208;H alkylation and alkenylation reactions, exhibiting exceptional regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, all achieved under redox&#8208;neutral and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. The method involves a three&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot or two&#8208;pot sequence, including 1,4&#8208;dearomative addition, functionalization at C3&#8208;, elimination or transalkylation to produce 3&#8208;alkylated /alkenylated quinolines. The presence of a carbonyl group in these products allows for further synthetic manipulations, enabling the production of cyanides, amides, amines, or simple alkyl derivatives.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conversion of quinoline C-H bonds to C-C bonds is essential for obtaining the enormous array of derivatives required for pharmaceutical and agrochemical development. Despite over a century of synthetic efforts, the direct alkylation and alkenylation at C3-H positions in a wide array of quinoline precursors remain predominantly challenging and elusive. This report outlines the first successful quinoline C3-H alkylation and alkenylation reactions, exhibiting exceptional regio- and stereoselectivity, all achieved under redox-neutral and transition-metal-free conditions. The method involves a three-step, one-pot or two-pot sequence, including 1,4-dearomative addition, functionalization at C3-, elimination or transalkylation to produce 3-alkylated /alkenylated quinolines.

         <title>Directly Regenerating of Spent LiCoO2 with Gradient F&#8208;doped Subsurface towards Ultra&#8208;stable Storage Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As great potential recycling strategy, the direct regeneration of spent LiCoO2 (LCO) is beneficial for lowering environmental pollutions and promoting global sustainability. However, owing to the using of binder and electrolyte, some fluorine impurities would be remained into spent materials. Considering the doping behaviors of F&#8208;elements, their suitable content introducing would facilitate the energy&#8208;storage abilities of regenerated LCO. Herein, through the tailored introduction of F&#8208;elements, spent LCO are successfully regenerated with physical&#8208;chemical evolutions. Benefitting from the existed oxygen vacancies, the diffusion energy&#8208;barrier of F&#8208;elements is reduced from 1.73 eV to 0.61 eV, facilitating the establishment of gradient F&#8208;doped subsurface, along with the formation of rigid CoO5F. Meanwhile, excess F&#8208;elements (1 wt.%, as a threshold) lead to the formation of LiF passivation layer on the surface. Thus, the as&#8208;optimized sample displays a considerable capacity of 154.4 mAh g&#8208;1 even at 5.0 C, with retention rate (88.3%) in 3.0~4.5V. Supported by detailed electrochemical and kinetic analysis, the structural advantages are confirmed to boost the improved redox activity of Co&#8208;ions and the alleviating of irreversible oxygen&#8208;release. Give this, the work is anticipated to reveal the evolutions of regenerated LCO with the introduced F&#8208;elements, whilst providing the practical regeneration strategies toward excellent high&#8208;voltage properties.</dc:description>

         <title>All&#8208;Atom Protein Sequence Design Based on Geometric Deep Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing sequences for specific protein backbones is a key&#160;step in creating new functional proteins. Here, we introduce&#160;GeoSeqBuilder, a deep learning framework that integrates&#160;protein sequence generation with side chain conformation&#160;prediction to produce the complete all&#8208;atom structures for&#160;designed sequences. GeoSeqBuilder uses spatial geometric&#160;features from protein backbones and explicitly includes&#160;three&#8208;body interactions of neighboring residues. GeoSeqBuilder&#160;achieves native residue type recovery rate of 51.6%,&#160;comparable to ProteinMPNN and&#160; other&#160;leading&#160;methods,&#160;while accurately predicting side chain conformations. We&#160;first used GeoSeqBuilder to design sequences for thioredoxin&#160;and a hallucinated three&#8208;helical bundle protein. All the&#160;15 tested sequences expressed as soluble monomeric proteins&#160;with high thermal stability, and the 2 high&#8208;resolution&#160;crystal structures solved closely match the designed models.&#160;The generated protein sequences exhibit low similarity&#160;(minimum 23%) to the original sequences, with significantly&#160;altered hydrophobic cores. We further redesigned the hydrophobic&#160;core of glutathione peroxidase 4, and 3 of the 5&#160;designs showed improved enzyme activity. Although further&#160;testing is needed, the high experimental success rate&#160;in our testing demonstrates that GeoSeqBuilder is a powerful&#160;tool for designing novel sequences for predefined protein&#160;structures with atomic details.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To develop next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based drugs and dual&#8208;drug combination therapy for cancer, we proposed to develop a copper (Cu) complex that exerts anticancer function by integrating chemotherapy, immunotherapy and catalyzes a click reaction for the in situ synthesis of a chemotherapeutic agent, thereby achieving targeted dual&#8208;agent combination therapy. We designed and synthesized a tetranuclear Cu(I) complex (Cu4) with remarkable cytotoxicity and notable catalytic ability for the in situ synthesis of a chemotherapeutic agent via Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;cycloaddition (CuAAC). We also constructed an apoferritin (AFt)&#8208;Cu4 nanoparticles (NPs) delivery system. AFt&#8208;Cu4 NPs not only showed an enhanced performance of tumor growth inhibition, but also improved the targeting ability and reduced the systemic toxicity of Cu4 in vivo. Importantly, the anticancer effect was enhanced by combining the AFt&#8208;Cu4 NPs with the resveratrol analogue obtained from the CuAAC reaction in situ. Finally, we revealed the anticancer mechanism of the Cu4/AFt&#8208;Cu4 NPs, which involves both cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;induced systemic immune response.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity Inside Molecular Flasks: Acceleration Modes and Types of Selectivity Obtainable</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is increasing interest in the discovery and application of molecular flasks &#8208; supramolecular host structures capable of catalyzing organic reactions. Reminiscent of enzymes due to possessing a host cavity akin to an active site, molecular flasks can exhibit complex catalytic mechanisms and in many cases provide selectivity not achievable in bulk solvent. In this Review, we aim to organize the increasingly diverse examples through a two&#8208;part structure. In part one, we provide an overview of the different acceleration modes that operate within molecular flasks, while in part two we showcase, through selected examples, the different types of selectivity that are obtainable through the use of molecular flasks. Particular attention is given to examples that are relevant to current challenges in synthetic organic chemistry. We believe that this structure makes the field more approachable and thus will stimulate the development of novel applications of molecular flasks.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Sub&#8208;ppm Sensitivity in SO2 Detection with a Chemically Stable Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the inaugural experimental investigation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to address the formidable challenge of SO2 detection. Specifically, an imine&#8208;functionalized COF (SonoCOF&#8208;9) demonstrated a modest and reversible SO2 sorption of 3.5 mmol g&#8208;1 at 1 bar and 298 K. At 0.1 bar (and 298 K), the total SO2 uptake reached 0.91 mmol g&#8208;1 with excellent reversibility for at least 50 adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. An isosteric enthalpy of adsorption (&#916;Hads) for SO2 equaled &#8722;42.3 kJ mol&#8722;1, indicating a relatively strong interaction of SO2 molecules with the COF material. Also, molecular dynamics simulations and M&#248;ller&#8211;Plesset perturbation theory calculations showed the interaction of SO2 with &#960; density of the rings and lone pairs of the N atoms of SonoCOF&#8208;9. The combination of experimental data and theoretical calculations corroborated the potential use of this COF for the selective detection and sensing of SO2 at the sub&#8208;ppm level (0.0064 ppm of SO2).</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetic Excitations in Ferromagnetically Coupled Spin&#8208;1 Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the pursuit of high&#8208;spin building blocks for the formation of covalently bonded 1D or 2D materials with controlled magnetic interactions, $\pi$&#8208;electron magnetism offers an ideal framework to engineer ferromagnetic interactions between nanographenes. As a first step in this direction, we explore the spin properties of ferromagnetically coupled triangulenes &#8208;&#8208; triangular nanographenes with spin $S = 1$. By combining in&#8208;solution synthesis of rationally designed molecular precursors with on&#8208;surface synthesis, we successfully achieve covalently bonded $S = 2$ triangulene dimers and $S = 3$ trimers on Au(111). Starting with the triangulene dimer, we meticulously characterize its low&#8208;energy magnetic excitations using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). IETS reveals conductance steps corresponding to a quintet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet excitation, and a zero&#8208;bias peak resulting from higher&#8208;order spin&#8208;spin scattering of the five&#8208;fold degenerate ferromagnetic ground state. The Heisenberg model captures the key parameters of inter&#8208;triangulene ferromagnetic exchange, and its successful extension to the larger $S = 3$ system validates the model's accuracy. We anticipate that incorporating ferromagnetically coupled building blocks into the repertoire of magnetic nanographenes will unlock new possibilities for designing carbon nanomaterials with complex magnetic ground states.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfonated Hydroxyaryl&#8208;Tetrazines with Increased pKa for Accelerated Bioorthogonal Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release Reactions in Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal reactions that enable switching molecular functions by breaking chemical bonds have gained prominence, with the tetrazine&#8208;mediated cleavage of trans&#8208;cyclooctene caged compounds (click&#8208;to&#8208;release) being particularly noteworthy for its high versatility, biocompatibility, and fast reaction rates. Despite several recent advances, the development of highly reactive tetrazines enabling quantitative elimination from trans&#8208;cyclooctene linkers remains challenging. In this study, we present the synthesis and application of sulfo&#8208;tetrazines, a class of derivatives featuring phenolic hydroxyl groups with increased acidity constants (pKa). This unique property leads to accelerated elimination and complete release of the caged molecules within minutes. Moreover, the inclusion of sulfonate groups provides a valuable synthetic handle, enabling further derivatization into sulfonamides, modified with diverse substituents. Significantly, we demonstrate the utility of sulfo&#8208;tetrazines in efficiently activating fluorogenic compounds and prodrugs in living cells, offering exciting prospects for their application in bioorthogonal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Agnostic Bioactivity&#8208;Driven Combinatorial Biosynthesis Reveals New Antidiabetic and Anticancer Triterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although combinatorial biosynthesis can dramatically expand the chemical structures of bioactive natural products to identify molecules with improved characteristics, progress in this direction has been hampered by the difficulty in isolating and characterizing the numerous produced compounds. This challenge could be overcome with improved designs that enable the analysis of the bioactivity of the produced metabolites ahead of the time&#8208;consuming isolation procedures. Herein, we showcase a structure&#8208;agnostic bioactivity&#8208;driven combinatorial biosynthesis workflow that introduces bioactivity assessment as a selection&#8208;driving force to guide iterative combinatorial biosynthesis rounds towards enzyme combinations with increasing bioactivity. We apply this approach to produce triterpenoids with potent bioactivity against PTP1B, a promising molecular target for diabetes and cancer treatment. We demonstrate that the bioactivity&#8208;guided workflow can expedite the combinatorial process by enabling the narrowing down of more than 1000 possible combinations to only five highly potent candidates. By focusing the isolation and structural elucidation effort on only these five strains, we reveal 20 structurally diverse triterpenoids, including four new compounds and a novel triterpenoid&#8208;anthranilic acid hybrid, as potent PTP1B inhibitors. This workflow expedites hit identification by combinatorial biosynthesis and is applicable to many other types of bioactive natural products, therefore providing a strategy for accelerated drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Solid&#8208;State Post&#8208;synthetic Modification of Highly Luminescent Cu(I) Metallacycles toward New Luminescent Thermic Tracers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new luminescent Cu(I) tetrametallic metallacycle B is reported, featuring very rare semi&#8208;bridging aqua ligands. As heated markedly above room temperature, this compound undergoes in the solid&#8208;state a post&#8208;synthetic transformation, affording the new luminescent metallacycle C. Thermogravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy and single crystals X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal that this alteration preserves the gross tetrametallic macrocycle structure, however caused by the release of the coordinated water molecules with the concomitant formation of cuprophilic interactions. This transition induces a shift from eye&#8208;perceived green (B) to blue (C) room temperature luminescence for these molecular solids. Photophysical measurements and time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional theory calculations have been conducted to identify the origins of the emission properties lying in these structurally related assemblies, suggesting that Thermally Actived Delayed Fluorescence dominates the radiative relaxation pathways.

As heated markedly above room temperature, this compound undergoes in the solid-state a post-synthetic transformation, affording the new luminescent metallacycle C. Thermogravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy and single crystals X-ray diffraction reveal that this alteration preserves the gross tetrametallic macrocycle structure, however caused by the release of the coordinated water molecules with the concomitant formation of cuprophilic interactions. This transition induces a shift from eye-perceived green (B) to blue (C) room temperature luminescence for these molecular solids. Photophysical measurements and time-dependent density-functional theory calculations have been conducted to identify the origins of the emission properties lying in these structurally related assemblies, suggesting that Thermally Actived Delayed Fluorescence dominates the radiative relaxation pathways. This study highlights the innovative feature of Cu(I) derivatives, offering the access to stimuli-sensitive materials that can witness a posteriori the exceeding of critical temperatures in their environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Group Metal High&#8208;Entropy Selenides for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selenides of platinum&#8208;group metals (PGMs) are emerging as promising catalysts for diverse electrochemical reactions. To date, most studies have focused on single metal or bimetallic systems, whereas the preparation of a high&#8208;entropy (HE) selenide consisting of five or more PGM elements holds the promise to further enhance catalytic performance by introducing abundant active sites with various local coordination environments and electronic structures. Herein, we report for the first time the synthesis of PGM&#8208;based HE&#8208;Selenide (HE&#8208;Se) nanoparticles with a unique amorphous structure. The atomic metal&#8211;Se coordination and the presence of short&#8208;range order were thoroughly revealed. It is further shown that the amorphous HE&#8208;Se can be facilely transformed into a single&#8208;phase crystalline HE&#8208;Se with a cubic structure by thermal annealing. Catalytically, the amorphous HE&#8208;Se showed better acidic hydrogen evolution activity over monometallic PGM&#8208;based selenides and the crystalline counterpart, demonstrating the advantages of high&#8208;entropy configuration and amorphous structure. Our findings may pave the way toward the synthesis and property exploration of amorphous PGM&#8208;based selenides with tunable compositions.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Modulated Short&#8208;Chain Cathode for Low&#8208;Temperature All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries (ASSLSBs) due to high theoretical energy density and exceptional safety are highly desirable for electric aircraft. However, as the flight altitude rises, the low&#8208;temperature performance is hampered by inadequate practical capacity. Here, we discover that low&#8208;temperature sulfur utilization is constrained by the multi&#8208;step endothermic conversion reaction. By introducing multi&#8208;chalcogen to modulate the local entropy, a short&#8208;chain molecule cathode is designed to shorten the reduction pathways and enhance low&#8208;temperature discharge capacity. Furthermore, the mismatched lithiation lattice of the short&#8208;chain cathode reduces the decomposition energy barriers, thus enhancing low&#8208;temperature charge/discharge reversibility. The designed short&#8208;chain cathode exhibits high cathode utilization (99.4%) and cycling stability (400 cycles, 92.2% retention) at room temperature, as well as delivers excellent discharge capacity (579.6 mAh g&#8208;1, &#8208;40 &#176;C) and cycling performance (100 cycles, 98.4% retention, 394.9 Wh kg&#8208;1electrode, &#8208;20 &#176;C) at low temperature. This study presents new opportunities to stimulate the development of low&#8208;temperature ASSLSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise One&#8208;Shot Borylation Reactions for Intersecting DABNA Substructures Exhibiting Bright Yellow&#8210;Green Electroluminescence with EQE Beyond 40% and Mild Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron/nitrogen (B/N)&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with the multiple resonance (MR) effect are promising for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) because of their narrowband emission and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics. Nevertheless, exploring the variety of such emitters is challenging because of the tricky and limited synthetic protocols. Herein, we designed a novel B/N&#8208;doped PAH, L&#8208;DABNA&#8208;1, whose backbone (L&#8208;DABNA) could not be achieved via conventional routes (e.g., one&#8208;pot borylation or one&#8208;shot borylation). We successfully synthesized it through stepwise one&#8208;shot borylations with precisely introducing decorations. The unique MR backbone with intersecting DABNA substructures sharing an aniline group, avoiding any para&#8208;N&#8208;&#960;&#8208;B motif, allows L&#8208;DABNA&#8208;1 to maintain narrowband TADF emission while significantly redshifting to the yellow&#8211;green region with a reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) of 1.28 &#215; 105 s&#8722;1. An L&#8208;DABNA&#8208;1&#8208;based OLED device achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 40% and maintained a high EQE of 36.3% at 1000 cd m&#8722;2, with a current efficiency reaching ~170 cd A&#8722;1. This work not only demonstrated the great potential of stepwise borylations in synthesizing B/N&#8208;doped PAH backbones, expanding their chemical space, but also provided a promising pathway for exploring MR&#8208;TADF emitters at longer wavelengths.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites are promising candidates for &#947;&#8208;ray&#160;spectrum detectors. However, achieving high&#8208;resolution energy spectra in single&#8208;photon pulse&#8208;height analysis mode remains challenging, due to the inevitable leakage currents degrade the recognizable fingerprint energies which is critical for resolving &#947;&#8208;ray spectroscopy. We demonstrate under high bias voltage, a deficient contact barrier can lead to excessive surface charge injection, thereby increasing leakage current from electrodes to perovskites. Hence, we conceive to employ surface ligand engineering on perovskite single crystals to manipulate energy levels to suppress leakage current. In particular, anchoring a strong dipole ligand onto the perovskite induced surface charge&#8208;density displacement, leading to a downward band bending and heightened the corresponding contact barrier. Consequently, the strategy minimized the detectors&#8217;leakage current by an order of magnitude, to as low as 44 nA cm&#8208;2. The resulting detectors show a significant improvement in energy resolution, 3.9% for 22Na 511 keV &#947;&#8208;rays has been achieved at room temperature. The resulting detector further resolves each fingerprint energy for 152Eu &#947;&#8208;spectrum, representing one of the best &#947;&#8208;rays perovskite detectors reported to date. Moreover, the detectors exhibited stabilized energy resolution without any degradation under a continuous electric field&#160;for over 300 minutes, representing the longest longevity reported to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrolytic Depolymerization of Polyolefins Catalysed by Zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defective UiO&#8208;66, a Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) catalyst, overcomes limitations in plastic waste depolymerization. During pyrolysis at 400&#8201;&#176;C, it promotes conversion of polyolefins to useful liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons, reducing solid wax formation. This approach also offers a distinct catalytic pathway compared to conventional zeolite catalysts.







Abstract
Polyolefins such as polyethylenes and polypropylenes are the most&#8208;produced plastic waste globally, yet are difficult to convert into useful products due to their unreactivity. Pyrolysis is a practical method for large&#8208;scale treatment of mixed, contaminated plastic, allowing for their conversion into industrially&#8208;relevant petrochemicals. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), despite their tremendous utility in heterogeneous catalysis, have been overlooked for polyolefin depolymerization due to their perceived thermal instabilities and inability of polyethylenes and polypropylenes to penetrate their pores. Herein, we demonstrate the viability of UiO&#8208;66 MOFs containing coordinatively&#8208;unsaturated zirconium nodes, as effective catalysts for pyrolysis that significantly enhances the yields of valuable liquid and gas hydrocarbons, whilst halving the amounts of residual solids produced. Reactions occur on the Lewis&#8208;acidic UiO&#8208;66 nodes, without the need for noble metals, and yield aliphatic product distributions distinctly different from the aromatic&#8208;rich hydrocarbons that can be obtained from zeolite catalysis. We also demonstrate the first unambiguous characterization of polyolefin penetration into UiO&#8208;66 pores at pyrolytic temperatures, allowing access to the abundant Zr&#8208;oxo nodes within the MOF interior for efficient C&#8722;C cleavage. Our work highlights the potential of MOFs as highly&#8208;designable heterogeneous catalysts for depolymerisation of plastics, which can complement conventional catalysts in reactivity.

         <title>Copper(I) Catalysed Diboron(4) Reduction of Nitrous Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new process for the deoxygenation of nitrous oxide is presented which uses copper(I) boryl complexes as highly productive catalysts and leverages the oxophilicity of boron as a thermodynamic driving force. Selective N&#8722;O bond activation of nitrous oxide is mediated by O&#8208;atom insertion into the metal&#8211;boron bond and turnover numbers over 800 can be achieved under mild conditions.







Abstract
A process for the catalytic reduction of nitrous oxide using NHC&#8208;ligated copper(I) tert&#8208;butoxide precatalysts and B2pin2 as the reductant is reported. These reactions proceed under mild conditions via copper(I)&#8208;boryl intermediates which react with N2O by facile O&#8208;atom insertion into the Cu&#8722;B bond and liberate N2. Turnover numbers &gt;800 can be achieved at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 1&#8197;bar N2O.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron Donor Acceptor Complex&#8208;Enabled &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkenylation of Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, mild, operationally simple, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H alkenylation of various readily available cyclic, acyclic, and benzo&#8208;fused cyclic amines with a series of alkenylborate esters to prepare allylic amines was developed. This protocol features a broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, high E/Z and diastereoselectivities, and good compatibility with water and oxygen. Mechanistic studies suggest that the success of this chemistry relies on the formation of a photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex between 2&#8208;iodobenzamide and the tetraalkoxyborate anion.







Abstract
Allylic amines are prevalent and vital structural components present in many bioactive compounds and natural products. Additionally, they serve as valuable intermediates and building blocks, with wide&#8208;ranging applications in organic synthesis. However, direct &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H alkenylation of feedstock amines, particularly for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;alkenylated cyclic amines, has posed a longstanding challenge. Herein, we present a general, mild, operationally simple, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;alkenylation of various readily available amines with alkenylborate esters in excellent E/Z &#8208; and diastereoselectivities. This method features good compatibility with water and oxygen, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance, thereby enabling the late&#8208;stage modification of various complex molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that the formation of a photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex between 2&#8208;iodobenzamide and the tetraalkoxyborate anion, which subsequently undergoes photoinduced single electron transfer and intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer to generate the crucial &#945;&#8208;amino radicals, is the key to success of this chemistry.

         <title>Ladder&#8208;Type Redox&#8208;Active Polymer Achieves Ultra&#8208;Stable and Fast Proton Storage in Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ladder&#8208;type rigid&#8208;coplanar polymer with highly ordered molecular arrangement has been designed via a covalent cycloconjugation conformational strategy. Benefitting from the extended &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization within the highly aromatic ladder&#8208;type polymeric backbone, the as&#8208;prepared polymer exhibits fast intra&#8208;chain charge transport along the polymeric chain, realizing its extraordinary proton&#8208;storage capability in aqueous proton batteries.







Abstract
A ladder&#8208;type rigid&#8208;coplanar polymer with highly ordered molecular arrangement has been designed via a covalent cycloconjugation conformational strategy. Benefitting from the extended &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization in the highly aromatic ladder&#8208;type polymeric backbone, the prepared polymer exhibits fast intra&#8208;chain charge transport along the polymeric chain, realizing extraordinary proton&#8208;storage capability in aqueous proton batteries.Affordable and safe aqueous proton batteries (APBs) with unique &#8220;Grotthuss mechanism,&#8221; are very significant for advancing carbon neutrality initiatives. While organic polymers offer a robust and adaptable framework that is well&#8208;suited for APB electrodes, the limited proton&#8208;storage redox capacity has constrained their broader application. Herein, a ladder&#8208;type polymer (PNMZ) has been designed via a covalent cycloconjugation conformational strategy that exhibits optimized electronic structure and fast intra&#8208;chain charge transport within the high&#8208;aromaticity polymeric skeleton. As a result, the polymer exhibits exceptional proton&#8208;storage redox kinetics, which are evidenced by in&#8208;operando monitoring techniques and theoretical calculations. It achieves a remarkable proton&#8208;storage capacity of 189&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability, with approximately 97.8&#8201;% capacity retention over 10,000&#8197;cycles. Finally, a high&#8208;performance all&#8208;polymer APB device has been successfully constructed with a desirable capacity retention of 99.7&#8201;% after 6,000&#8197;cycles and high energy density of 56.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Radical 6&#8208;Endo Addition Enables Pyridine Synthesis under Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first radical 6&#8208;endo addition strategy to synthesize pyridines under metal&#8208;free conditions is reported. Experimental and computational studies indicate the critical roles of hypervalent iodine(III) for the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig addition rather than 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig addition to afford pyridines.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free synthesis of heterocycles is highly sought after in the pharmaceutical industry and has garnered widespread attention due to eliminating the need to remove trace metal catalysts from the reaction. We report a radical 6&#8208;endo addition method for pyridine synthesis from cyclopropylamides and alkynes under metal&#8208;free conditions. Various terminal and substituted alkynes are inserted as C2&#8197;units into cyclopropylamides to synthesize versatile pyridines with 57 examples. Mechanistic investigations and computational studies indicate the unprecedented 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig addition of vinyl radicals to the imine nitrogen atom rather than the conventional 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig addition to the imine carbon atom, in which the hypervalent iodine(III) plays a critical role. This reaction easily scales up with excellent functional group compatibility and suits the late&#8208;stage pyridine installation on complex molecules.

         <title>Direct Asymmetric Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aminoimines from 1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;N&#8208;Sulfinylimines by Using Allyl Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first direct asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminoimines is achieved employing chiral bis&#8208;sulfinylimines and allylboronic acids. The exclusive monoallylation occurred at room temperature with complete stereodivergence. The reactivity difference of the spare imine toward allylboronic acids and metal&#8208;based nucleophiles, is a major highlight of this protocol. Chiral 1,2&#8208;diamines and &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles were readily accessed from &#945;&#8208;aminoimines.







Abstract
A unique direct asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminoimines is realized, through rapid and exclusive mono&#8208;allylation of chiral bis&#8208;N&#8208;sulfinylimines using allylboronic acids. The highly selective allylation was possible as electrophilic imine functional group in the product &#945;&#8208;aminoimines remained unreactive towards allyl boronic acid nucleophiles. Notably, by varying the geometry and chiral auxiliary, all four isomers of the &#945;&#8208;aminoimines were accessed from readily available precursors. A range of allyl nucleophiles, which are tricky to generate by other means possessing highly reactive functional groups also took part in this reaction, expanding the scope further. The applicability of the products &#945;&#8208;aminoimines were further demonstrated by accessing a range of structurally diverse chiral cyclic and acyclic 1,2&#8208;diamines bearing adjacent stereocenters through addition of a second nucleophile or Prins&#8208;type cyclization by exploiting the nucleophilicity of the tethered alkene moiety. Moreover, the leaving group aptitude of sulfinyl auxiliary attached to imine, was exploited to access valuable chiral &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles under thermal conditions without employing any reagents. Detailed DFT calculation revealed a chair&#8208;like transition state, arising from corresponding allylboroxine species, likely operating for the allylboration reaction across imine.

         <title>Near&#8211;Infrared Heptamethine Cyanine Photosensitizers with Efficient Singlet Oxygen Generation for Anticancer Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR photosensitizer is designed by introducing Se into heptamethine cyanine, which narrows the energy gap (&#916;Est) through intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between Se atom and polymethine chain. The decreased &#916;Est together with increased spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) induced by heavy atom effect of Se effectively induces the ultra&#8208;efficient 1O2 generation, breaking the bottleneck of weak1O2 generation of NIR photosensitizers.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers are valuable tools to improve treatment depth in photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, their low singlet oxygen (1O2) generation ability, indicated by low 1O2 quantum yield, presents a formidable challenge for PDT. To overcome this challenge, the heptamethine cyanine was decorated with biocompatible S (Scy7) and Se (Secy7) atom. We observe that Secy7 exhibits a redshift in the main absorption to ~840&#8197;nm and an ultra&#8208;efficient 1O2 generation capacity. The emergence of a strong intramolecular charge transfer effect between the Se atom and polymethine chain considerably narrows the energy gap (0.51&#8197;eV), and the heavy atom effect of Se strengthens spin&#8211;orbit coupling (1.44&#8197;cm&#8722;1), both of which greatly improved the high triplet state yield (61&#8201;%), a state that determines the energy transfer to O2. Therefore, Secy7 demonstrated excellent 1O2 generation capacity, which is ~24.5&#8208;fold that of indocyanine green, ~8.2&#8208;fold that of IR780, and ~1.3&#8208;fold that of methylene blue under low&#8208;power&#8208;density 850&#8197;nm irradiation (5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Secy7 exhibits considerable phototoxicity toward cancer cells buried under 12&#8197;mm of tissue. Nanoparticles formed by encapsulating Secy7 within amphiphilic polymers and lecithin, demonstrated promising antitumor and anti&#8208;pulmonary metastatic effects, exhibiting remarkable potential for advancing PDT in deep tissues.

         <title>Path&#8208;Independent All&#8208;Visible Orthogonal Photoswitching for Applications in Multi&#8208;Photochromic Polymers and Molecular Computing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;visible, all&#8208;light responsive, and path&#8208;independent orthogonal photoswitching has been achieved by combining peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo and a rhodanine&#8208;based photoswitch. Four persistent colors can be interchanged by irradiation with light and could be transferred to a multi&#8208;photochromic transparent polymer material. The addition of a third fluorophore component enables advanced all&#8208;photonic logic operations.







Abstract
Synthetic molecular photoswitches have taken center stage as high&#8208;precision tools to introduce light&#8208;responsiveness at the smallest scales. Today they are found in all areas of applied chemistry, covering materials research, chemical biology, catalysis, or nanotechnology. For a next step of applicability truly orthogonal photoswitching is highly desirable but to date such independent addressability of different photoswitches remains highly challenging. Herein we present the first example of all&#8208;visible, all&#8208;light responsive, and path&#8208; independent orthogonal photoswitching. By combining two recently developed indigoid photoswitches &#8208; peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo and a rhodanine&#8208;based chromophore &#8208; a four&#8208;state system is established and each state can be accessed in high yields completely independently and also with visible light irradiation only. The four states give rise to four different colors, which can be transferred to a solid polymer matrix to yield a versatile multi&#8208;state photochromic material. Further, combination with a fluorescent dye as a third component is possible, demonstrating the applicability of this orthogonal photoswitching system in all&#8208;photonic molecular logic behavior and information processing.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8208;shell MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;Vs with highly adjustable shell thickness and rare interpenetrated structure were constructed by innovatively exploiting C&#8722;C linkage, demonstrating much better degradation performance than their parent components, and imine&#8208;linked MIL&#8208;68&#8208;NH2@COF&#8722;V. Moreover, the in situ grown MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;V films exhibited broad&#8208;spectrum, reusable and significantly enhanced removal capabilities for diverse pollutants in river water by solar drive.







Abstract
Diversifying the connecting junctions will be feasible for the controllable collaboration of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to rationally design multifunction&#8208;integrated heterostructures with enhanced performance, yet it is in the nascent stage. Herein, by intelligently exploiting the polymerization of vinyl group, C&#8722;C bond is innovatively introduced to construct the core&#8211;shell MOF@COF heterostructures with adjustable shell thickness and rare interpenetrated structure. The unique structure endows prepared C&#8722;C&#8208;linked MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;Vs with more superior visible&#8208;light harvesting and photogenerated carrier separation capability, leading to significantly higher photocatalytic activity and faster degradation rate than pristine MIL&#8208;68&#8208;C=Cs, COF&#8722;V, and imine&#8208;linked MIL&#8208;68&#8208;NH2@COF&#8722;V. Further, the customized MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;V is in situ grown as reusable films with dramatically boosted performance under ambient conditions, which realize the highly efficient degradation of tetracycline within 15&#8197;min (96.5&#8201;%), rhodamine 6G within 25&#8197;min (97.6&#8201;%), and phenol within 40&#8197;min (95.3&#8201;%) by solar drive. This work exhibits the distinctive advantages of C&#8722;C junction in the MOF@COF construction, and highlights the application prospect of rational&#8208;designed heterostructure in the treatment of persistent organic pollutants.

         <title>Third Metal Ion Dictates the Catalytic Activity of the Two&#8208;Metal&#8208;Ion Pre&#8208;Ribosomal RNA&#8208;Processing Machinery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;atom simulations suggest that a transient K+ ion at the catalytic site promotes catalysis in RNase mitochondrial RNA processing complex by rigidifying the active site and promoting proton transfer from the water nucleophile to the scissile phosphate. Conversely, the third Mg2+ ion captured in the experimental structure hinders catalysis by blocking the proton transfer and preventing the approach of the K+ ion.







Abstract
Nucleic acid processing enzymes use a two&#8208;Mg2+&#8208;ion motif to promote the formation and cleavage of phosphodiester bonds. Yet, recent evidence demonstrates the presence of spatially conserved second&#8208;shell cations surrounding the catalytic architecture of proteinaceous and RNA&#8208;dependent enzymes. The RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (MRP) complex, which cleaves the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor at the A3 cleavage site to yield mature 5&#8242;&#8208;end of 5.8S rRNA, hosts in the catalytic core one atypically&#8208;located Mg2+ ion, in addition to the ions forming the canonical catalytic motif. Here, we employ biased quantum classical molecular dynamics simulations of RNase MRP to discover that the third Mg2+ ion inhibits the catalytic process. Instead, its displacement in favour of a second&#8208;shell monovalent K+ ion propels phosphodiester bond cleavage by enabling the formation of a specific hydrogen bonding network that mediates the essential proton transfer step. This study points to a direct involvement of a transient K+ ion in the catalytic cleavage of the phosphodiester bond and implicates cation trafficking as a general mechanism in nucleic acid processing enzymes and ribozymes.

         <title>Improved Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis through Hydrogen Poisoning Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen poisoning effects over NiCoP@CC occurring at low overpotentials can leave behind catalytically inert poisoned HI* at Co&#8208;hollow sites and thereby create ideally reactive HII*. The dimerization between HI* and HII* for HER was suppressed due to catalytic inertia of HI* and thereby NITRR was timely initiated through HII* owing to ideal hydrogenation reactivity of HII*. As a result, a record high NH3 production rate and Faraday efficiency were achieved at low energy consumption.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion from nitrate to ammonia is a key step in sustainable ammonia production. However, it suffers from low productive efficiency or high energy consumption due to a lack of desired electrocatalysts. Here we report nickel cobalt phosphide (NiCoP) catalysts for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electrocatalysis that display a record&#8208;high catalytic current density of &#8722;702&#177;7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, ammonia production rate of 5415&#177;26&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and Faraday efficiency of 99.7&#177;0.2&#8201;% at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE, affording the estimated energy consumption as low as 22.7&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgammonia&#8722;1. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that these catalysts benefit from hydrogen poisoning effects, which leave behind catalytically inert adsorbed hydrogen species (HI*) at Co&#8208;hollow sites and thereupon enable ideally reactive HII* at secondary Co&#8722;P sites. The dimerization between HI* and HII* for H2 evolution is blocked due to the catalytic inertia of HI* thereby the HII* drives nitrate hydrogenation timely. With these catalysts, the continuous ammonia production is further shown in an electrolyser with a real energy consumption of 18.9&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgammonia&#8722;1.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonds Based Reprogrammable and Re&#8208;Processable Supramolecular Liquid Crystal Elastomer Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic crosslinked LCE network based on metal&#8208;ligand bonds can achieve orientation programming of liquid crystal mesogen via partial stress relaxation. This programmed LCE maintains stable actuation even at elevated temperatures due to the high strength of metal&#8208;ligand bonds comparable to traditional covalent bonds. The flexible and reversible nature of metal&#8208;ligand interactions also allows for the reprogramming of actuation behaviors and enables reprocessing and reshaping upon complete dissociation.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent bonds endow liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) with network rearrangeability, facilitating the fixation of mesogen alignment induced by external forces and enabling reversible actuation. In comparison, the bond exchange of supramolecular interactions is typically too significant to stably maintain the programmed alignment, particularly under intensified external stimuli. Nevertheless, remaking and recycling of supramolecular interaction&#8208;based polymer networks are more accessible than those based on dynamic covalent bonds, as the latter are difficult to completely dissociate. Thus, preparing an LCE that possesses both supramolecular&#8208;like exchangeability and covalent bond&#8208;level stability remains a significant challenge. In this work, we addressed this issue by employing metal&#8208;ligand bonds as the crosslinking points of LCE networks. As such, mesogen alignment can be repeatedly encoded through metal&#8208;ligand bond exchange and stably maintained after programming, since the bond exchange rate is sufficiently slow when the programming and actuation temperatures are below the bond dissociation temperature. More importantly, the metal&#8208;ligand bonds can be completely dissociated at high temperatures, allowing the LCE network to be dissolved in a solvent and reshaped into desired geometries via solution casting. Building on these properties, our LCEs can be fabricated into versatile actuators, such as reversible folding origami, artificial muscles, and soft robotics.

         <title>Piezo&#8208;catalysis Mechanism Elucidation by Tracking Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide with In situ EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative in situ EPR monitoring strategy is introduced to investigate the active species involved in the ORR&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 pathways by electro&#8208;, photo&#8208; and piezo&#8208;catalysis. The formation of immediate species in piezo&#8208;catalysis is more inclined towards photo&#8208;catalysis rather than electro&#8208;catalysis, offering prospective evidence to support the choice of mechanism for piezo&#8208;catalysis.







Abstract
For piezoelectric catalysis, the catalytic mechanism is a topic of great controversy, with debates centered around whether it belongs to the energy band theory or the screening charge effect which are similar to mechanisms of photocatalysis and electrochemical catalysis, respectively. Due to the formation of different intermediate active&#8208;species during two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;catalysis, the key to solving this problem is precisely monitoring the active species involved in ORR during electro&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and piezo&#8208;catalysis under identical condition. Here, a semiconductor material, BiOBr with abundant oxygen vacancies (BOB&#8208;OV) was found remarkable catalytic activity in H2O2 production by all three catalytic methods. By employing in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, the H2O2 evolution pathway through piezo&#8208;catalysis over BOB&#8208;OV was monitored, which showed a similar reaction pathway to that observed in photo&#8208;catalytic process. This finding represents solid evidence supporting the notion that piezo&#8208;catalytic mechanism of ORR is more inclined towards photo&#8208;catalysis rather than electro&#8208;catalysis. Significantly, this exploratory conclusion provides insight to deepen our understanding of piezo&#8208;catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;For piezoelectric catalysis, the catalytic mechanism is a topic of great controversy, with debates centered around whether it belongs to the energy band theory or the screening charge effect which are similar to mechanisms of photocatalysis and electrochemical catalysis, respectively. Due to the formation of different intermediate active-species during two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via electro- and photo-catalysis, the key to solving this problem is precisely monitoring the active species involved in ORR during electro-, photo-, and piezo-catalysis under identical condition. Here, a semiconductor material, BiOBr with abundant oxygen vacancies (BOB-OV) was found remarkable catalytic activity in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production by all three catalytic methods. By employing in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution pathway through piezo-catalysis over BOB-OV was monitored, which showed a similar reaction pathway to that observed in photo-catalytic process. This finding represents solid evidence supporting the notion that piezo-catalytic mechanism of ORR is more inclined towards photo-catalysis rather than electro-catalysis. Significantly, this exploratory conclusion provides insight to deepen our understanding of piezo-catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reductive Elimination From Tetra&#8208;Alkyl Cuprates [MenCu(CF3)4&#8722;n]&#8722; (n=0&#8211;4): Beyond Simple Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full series of high&#8208;valent cuprates [MenCu(CF3)4&#8722;n]&#8722;, 0&#8804;n&#8804;4, has been studied by a combination of gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments and quantum chemical calculations. The distinct reactivities observed can be attributed to subtle differences in the electronic structures of the complexes.







Abstract
In recent years, the electronic structures of organocuprates in general and the complex [Cu(CF3)4]&#8722; in particular have attracted significant interest. A possible key indicator in this context is the reactivity of these species. Nonetheless, this aspect has received only limited attention. Here, we systematically study the series of tetra&#8208;alkyl cuprates [MenCu(CF3)4&#8722;n]&#8722; and their unimolecular reactivity in the gas phase, which includes concerted formal reductive eliminations as well as radical losses. Through computational studies, we characterize the electronic structures of the complexes and show how these are connected to their reactivity. We find that all [MenCu(CF3)4&#8722;n]&#8722; ions feature inverted ligand fields and that the distinct reactivity patterns of the individual complexes arise from the interplay of different effects.

         <title>Molecular Bridging Induced Anti&#8208;Salting&#8208;Out Effect Enabling High Ionic Conductive ZnSO4&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subtle molecular bridging strategy is proposed to enhance the compatibility between PVA and ZnSO4 from the perspective of hydrogen&#8208;bonding microenvironment re&#8208;construction. The urea molecules adsorbed on electrode are electropolymerized under voltage to form organic SEI. Such SEI functions as a binder, stabilizing the electrode interface and promoting uniform Zn deposition. Additionally, this SEI layer effectively mitigates side reactions, thereby enhancing the overall electrochemical performance and durability of the electrode.







Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes (HEs) hold great promise in tackling severe issues emerging in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, but the prevalent salting&#8208;out effect of kosmotropic salt causes low ionic conductivity and electrochemical instability. Herein, a subtle molecular bridging strategy is proposed to enhance the compatibility between PVA and ZnSO4 from the perspective of hydrogen&#8208;bonding microenvironment re&#8208;construction. By introducing urea containing both an H&#8208;bond acceptor and donor, the broken H&#8208;bonds between PVA and H2O, initiated by the SO42&#8722;&#8208;driven H2O polarization, could be re&#8208;united via intense intermolecular hydrogen bonds, thus leading to greatly increased carrying capacity of ZnSO4. The urea&#8208;modified PVA&#8208;ZnSO4 HEs featuring a high ionic conductivity up to 31.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 successfully solves the sluggish ionic transport dilemma at the solid&#8208;solid interface. Moreover, an organic solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase can be derived from the in situ electro&#8208;polymerization of urea to prohibit H2O&#8208;involved side reactions, thereby prominently improving the reversibility of Zn chemistry. Consequently, Zn anodes witness an impressive lifespan extension from 50&#8197;h to 2200&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 while the Zn&#8208;I2 full battery maintains a remarkable Coulombic efficiency (&gt;99.7&#8201;%) even after 8000 cycles. The anti&#8208;salting&#8208;out strategy proposed in this work provides an insightful concept for addressing the phase separation issue of functional HEs.

         <title>SnF2&#8208;Catalyzed Lithiophilic&#8211;Lithiophobic Gradient Interface for High&#8208;Rate PEO&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SnF2&#8208;catalyzed lithiophilic&#8211;lithiophobic gradient SEI layer (SCG&#8208;SEI) exhibits a low nucleation overpotential along with strong mechanical strength, enabling rapid Li+ diffusion and electron conduction. This synergistic effect facilitates the dendrite&#8208;free deposition of PEO&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, thus ensuring excellent cells performance even under ultra&#8208;high temperature (100&#8201;&#176;C) and high current density (5&#8197;C).







Abstract
Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are strongly hindered by the fast dendrite growth at the Li metal/electrolyte interface, especially under large rates. The above issue stems from the suboptimal interfacial chemistry and poor Li+ transport kinetics during cycling. Herein, a SnF2&#8208;catalyzed lithiophilic&#8208;lithiophobic gradient solid electrolyte interphase (SCG&#8208;SEI) of LixSny/LiF&#8208;Li2O is in situ formed. The superior ionic LiF&#8208;Li2O rich upper layer (17.1&#8197;nm) possesses high interfacial energy and fast Li+ diffusion channels, wherein lithiophilic LixSny alloy layer (8.4&#8197;nm) could highly reduce the nucleation overpotential with lower diffusion barrier and promote rapid electron transportation for reversible Li+ plating/stripping. Simultaneously, the insoluble SnF2&#8208;coordinated PEO promotes the rapid Li+ ion transport in the bulk phase. As a result, an over 46.7 and 3.5&#8197;times improvements for lifespan and critical current density of symmetrical cells are achieved, respectively. Furthermore, LiFePO4&#8208;based ASSLMBs deliver a recorded cycling performance at 5&#8197;C (over 1000 cycles with a capacity retention of 80.0&#8201;%). More importantly, impressive electrochemical performances and safety tests with LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and pouch cell with LiFePO4, even under extreme conditions (i.e., 100&#8201;&#176;C), are also demonstrated, reconfirmed the importance of lithiophilic&#8208;lithiophobic gradient interfacial chemistry in the design of high&#8208;rate ASSLMBs for safety applications.

Thiol&#8208;catechol&#8208;connectivities (TCC) can be employed to form strong adhesive polymers, which are debondable by an oxidative trigger. The properties of such polymers can be tuned via the backbone of the monomers. Here, a nature&#8208;inspired peptidic biscatechol is compared to a fossil&#8208;based analogue. The catechol&#8208;amide interactions exhibited by the dipeptide allow for a more efficient debonding mechanism, outperforming the plain catechol oxidation variant.







Abstract
Debondable pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (PSAs) promise access to recyclability in microelectronics in the transition toward a circular economy. Two PSAs were synthesized from a tetravalent thiol star&#8208;polyester forming thiol&#8208;catechol&#8208;connectivities (TCC) with either the biorelated DiDopa&#8208;bisquinone (BY*Q) or the fossil&#8208;based bisquinone A (BQA). The PSAs enable debonding by oxidation of TCC&#8208;catechols to quinones. The extent of debonding efficiency depends on the interaction modes, which are determined by the chemical structure differences of both TCC&#8208;motifs. BY*Q&#8208;TCC&#8208;PSA debonds with exceptional loss of 99&#8201;% of its approx. 2&#8197;MPa shear strength in glass&#8208;on&#8208;glass junctions. For BQA&#8208;TCC&#8208;PSA, a debonding efficiency of only approx. 60&#8201;% was found, irrespective of its initial shear strength, which could be tuned up to approx. 7&#8197;MPa. The efficiency of debonding for BY*Q&#8208;TCC&#8208;PSA after TCC&#8208;oxidation is linked to the loss of synergistic interactions without strongly affecting the bulk glue properties, outperforming the purely catechol&#8208;based BQA&#8208;analogue.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Synthesis of a Self&#8208;Organized Chloro&#8208;Bridged Cubic Pd(II) Cage Showing Selective Encapsulation of Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepwise formation of a metal&#8208;chloride neutral cage has been shown to involve the initial pre&#8208;organization of the Pd3 subunits of a Pd6&#8208;hexamer mediated by a directional oxamide linker to a tetrameric Pd12 assembly followed by its conversion into a Pd12&#8208;tetrahedron and finally to a chloro&#8208;bridged Pd24 cube upon ligand substitution. The Pd24&#8208;cube shows selective encapsulation of phenolic guest molecules.







Abstract
The synthesis and guest recognition properties of a neutral Pd24&#8208;cubic cage, [{Pd3(NiPr)3PO}8(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)24] 1 are reported. The formation of the cubical assembly takes place by an exclusive one&#8208;pot ligand&#8208;assisted pathway directed by an oximido linker. The initial coordination of the oximido ligand pre&#8208;organizes the [Pd3(NiPr)3PO]3+ polyhedral building units into a tetrameric intermediate, which then transforms into an oximido&#8208;tethered tetrahedral assembly and to the cubical cage 1 in the presence of chloride ions. In the absence of the directing oximido linker, no cage formation was observed, and the Pd6&#8208;precursor was found to undergo self&#8208;condensation, giving rise to a new pentameric polyhedral cluster, [Pd5{(NiPr)3PO}2(OAc)2(OH)2] 2. The central cavity of the cube has been probed for guest encapsulation studies, which shows a high binding with phenolic guest molecules with association constants of the order of 104&#8211;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. The favorable formation of host&#8211;guest complexes was attributed to the strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the host and guest functional groups.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Efficient Co&#8208;Electrosynthesis of Formates from CO2 and Methanol Feedstocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer coupling acidic CO2RR with alkaline MOR to effectively co&#8208;produce formate. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR system exhibits high&#8208;efficiency electron utilization for formate production with over 180&#8201;% coulombic efficiency and more than 90&#8201;% selectivity for both CO2RR and MOR conversion. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR cell also demonstrates long&#8208;term stability exceeding 90&#8197;h of continuous operation and significantly reduces electricity consumption compared to the traditional CO2 electrolysis system.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals using renewable electricity shows significant promise for achieving carbon neutrality and providing alternative energy storage solutions. However, its practical application still faces significant challenges, including high energy consumption, poor selectivity, and limited stability. Here, we propose a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer that couples the acidic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at the cathode with alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) at the anode. This dual electro&#8208;synthesis cell is implemented by developing Bi nanosheets as cathode catalysts and oxide&#8208;decorated Cu2Se nanoflowers as anode catalysts, enabling high&#8208;efficiency electron utilization for formate production with over 180&#8201;% coulombic efficiency and more than 90&#8201;% selectivity for both CO2RR and MOR conversion. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR cell also demonstrates long&#8208;term stability exceeding 90&#8197;hours of continuous operation, delivers a formate partial current density of 130&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a voltage of only 2.1&#8197;V, and significantly reduces electricity consumption compared to the traditional CO2 electrolysis system. This study illuminates an innovative electron&#8208;efficiency and energy&#8208;saving techniques for CO2 electrolysis, as well as the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Boosting Stimulated Emission via a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Co&#8208;Crystallization Approach in Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stimulated emission of molecular crystals was boosted via a hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystallization strategy. Structural and theoretical analyses revealed that the higher radiative transition rate and shorter excited&#8208;lifetime in the cocrystal lead to a larger stimulated emission cross&#8208;section, thereby facilitating the occurrence of stimulated emission.







Abstract
Stimulated emission (SE) of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule in solid state remains a significant challenge, mainly involving the mode of molecular stacking that invariably alters the photo&#8208;physical processes. Herein, we successfully realized stimulated emission in molecular crystals using a hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystallization strategy. Two hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystals, obtained from 1,4&#8208;bis&#8208;p&#8208;cyanostyrylbenzene (CNDSB) and two types of co&#8208;formers, can boost stimulated emission and show decent amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), whereas the parent CNDSB crystal is not SE&#8208;active. Crystal structural analysis demonstrated that the co&#8208;crystallization eliminated excimer formation. The resulting higher kr and shorter excited lifetime led to a larger stimulated emission cross&#8208;section, which benefited to the occurrence of ASE. Simultaneously, the uniaxial arrangements along the long axis of co&#8208;crystal together contributed to highly polarized emission. This system presents very rare evidence of boosting stimulated emission by binary co&#8208;crystallization, which enriches our insights into organic solid&#8208;state lasers.

         <title>The Formation Mechanism of Carbonized Polymer Dots: Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Nucleation and Carbonization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crosslinking&#8208;induced nucleation and carbonization (CINC) is proposed as the formation mechanism of carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) by exploring the effect of crosslinking on the formation of CPDs. Based on the principle of CINC, the influence factors of size are revealed, and the higher crosslinking degree can also bring a higher carbonization degree to realize the regulation of photoluminescence.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs), as a kind of zero&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, have been widely synthesized by bottom&#8208;up methods from various precursors. However, the formation mechanism is still unclear and controversial, which also brings difficulty to the regulation of structures and properties. Only some tentative formation processes were postulated by analyzing the products obtained at different reaction times and temperatures. Here, the effect of crosslinking on the formation of carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) is explored. Crosslinking&#8208;induced nucleation and carbonization (CINC) is proposed as the driving force for the formation of CPDs. Under hydrothermal synthesis, the precursors are initiated to polymerize and crosslink. The crosslinking brings higher hydrophobicity to generate the hydrophilic/hydrophobic microphase separation, which promotes dehydration and carbonization resulting in the formation of CPDs. Based on the principle of CINC, the influence factors of size are also revealed. Moreover, the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation is employed to support this formation mechanism. This concept of CINC will bring light to the formation process of CPDs, as well as facilitate the regulation of CPDs&#8217; size and photoluminescence.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon dots (CDs), as a kind of zero-dimensional nanomaterials, have been widely synthesized by bottom-up methods from various precursors. However, the formation mechanism is still unclear and controversial, which also brings difficulty to the regulation of structures and properties. Only some tentative formation processes were postulated by analyzing the products obtained at different reaction times and temperatures. Here, the effect of crosslinking on the formation of carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) is explored. Crosslinking-induced nucleation and carbonization (CINC) is proposed as the driving force for the formation of CPDs. Under hydrothermal synthesis, the precursors are initiated to polymerize and crosslink. The crosslinking brings higher hydrophobicity to generate the hydrophilic/hydrophobic microphase separation, which promotes dehydration and carbonization resulting in the formation of CPDs. Based on the principle of CINC, the influence factors of size are also revealed. Moreover, the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation is employed to support this formation mechanism. This concept of CINC will bring light to the formation process of CPDs, as well as facilitate the regulation of CPDs&#8217; size and photoluminescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneous Material and Chemical Recycling of Waste PET/PE Multi&#8208;Layer Films under Hydrothermal Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we propose a hydrothermal process equipped with two filters for recycling PET/PE (PET: Polyethylene terephthalate; PE: Polyethylene) multi&#8208;layer films. At 300&#8201;&#176;C and 10&#8197;MPa, around 100&#8201;% of PET is hydrolyzed to monomers of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). Meanwhile, PE, TPA, and EG are collected separately using the same system, indicating the simultaneous material and chemical recycling of PET/PE films is firstly achieved.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;layer plastic films are widely used in various fields especially for packaging, but due to complex composition, it is very difficult to recover single&#8208;material polymers or high&#8208;purity monomers from them after usage. In this study, we proposed a hydrothermal process for recycling PET/PE (PET: Polyethylene terephthalate; PE: Polyethylene) films. PET can be hydrolyzed to monomers of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). Using a hydrothermal system equipped with two filters, PE, TPA, and EG were collected separately, indicating the simultaneous material and chemical recycling of PET/PE films was firstly achieved. At 300&#8201;&#176;C and 10&#8197;MPa for 60&#8197;min, PET conversion reached around 100&#8201;%, and TPA yield of 83.0&#8201;% was obtained with a high TPA purity of 96.1&#8201;%. In addition, the effect of the holding time on PET conversion, TPA yield, EG yield, and TPA purity was studied. This research opened up a new and sustainable pathway to recycle multi&#8208;layer plastic films in both lab and industry.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Pd&#8208;Catalyzed sp3 C&#8722;H Macrocyclization: Synthesis and Evaluation of Macrocyclic Sulfonamide for the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease</title>

         <dc:description>
A practical and concise ligand&#8208;enabled Pd(II)&#8208;catalysed sp3 C&#8722;H alkylation, olefination, and arylation macrocyclization is reported, which provided a novel set of pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic sulfonamides. A combination of in silico screening and biological evaluation led to the identification of a novel spiro&#8208;grafted macrocyclic sulfonamide, which demonstrated a potential efficacy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) in a mouse model through the activation of SIRT3.







Abstract
The development of simplified synthetic strategy to create structurally and functionally diverse pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic molecules is highly appealing but poses a marked challenge. Inspired by natural scaffolds, herein, we describe a practical and concise ligand&#8208;enabled Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed sp3 C&#8722;H alkylation, olefination and arylation macrocyclization, which could offer a novel set of pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic sulfonamides. Interestingly, the potential of ligand acceleration in C&#8722;H activation is also demonstrated by an unprecedented enantioselective sp3 C&#8722;H alkylation macrocyclization. Moreover, a combination of in silico screening and biological evaluation led to the identification of a novel spiro&#8208;grafted macrocyclic sulfonamide 2&#8201;a, which showed a promising efficacy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) in a mouse model through the activation of silent information regulator sirtuin 3 (SIRT3).

         <title>Precisely Constructing Molecular Junctions in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Efficient Artificial Photosynthetic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework photocatalyst was synthesized using a simple self&#8208;assembly strategy to introduce CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation sites into the framework. The resulting material has a highly crystalline structure, and the formation of inherent molecular junctions can accelerate photogenerated charge separation and transport, which achieves an excellent CO production rate of 309.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (selectivity, ~100&#8201;%).







Abstract
The development of artificial photocatalysts to convert CO2 into renewable fuels and H2O into O2 is a complex and crucial task in the field of photosynthesis research. The current challenge is to enhance photogenerated charge separation, as well as to increase the oxidation capability of materials. Herein, a molecular junction&#8208;type porphyrin&#8208;based crystalline photocatalyst (Ni&#8208;TCPP&#8208;TPyP) was successfully self&#8208;assembled by incorporating a nickel porphyrin complex as a reduction site and pyridyl porphyrin as an oxidation site via hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The resulting material has a highly crystalline structure, and the formation of inherent molecular junctions can accelerate photogenerated charge separation and transport. Thus, Ni&#8208;TCPP&#8208;TPyP achieved an excellent CO production rate of 309.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (selectivity, ~100&#8201;%) without the use of any sacrificial agents, which is more than ten times greater than that of single&#8208;component photocatalyst (Ni&#8208;TCPP) and greater than that of the most organic photocatalysts. The structure&#8208;function relationship was investigated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Our work provides new insight for designing efficient artificial photocatalysts, paving the way for the development of clean and renewable fuels through the conversion of CO2 using solar energy.

         <title>Highly Potent and Intestine Specific P&#8208;Glycoprotein Inhibitor to Enable Oral Delivery of Taxol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taxol is widely used in chemotherapy but couldn't be orally administrated. In this protocol, a series of benzofuran&#8208;fused&#8208;piperidine derivatives were achieved and compound 16&#8201;c was identified as potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor, which could enable oral delivery of Taxol in high efficiency and offers high therapeutic effects in breast cancer xenograft model along with almost none oral absorption itself. Therefore, this work provides a valuable strategy of Taxol's oral delivery and chemotherapy.







Abstract
Taxol is widely used in cancer chemotherapy; however, the oral absorption of Taxol remains a formidable challenge. Since the intestinal p&#8208;glycoprotein (P&#8208;gp) mediated drug efflux is one of the primary causes, the development of P&#8208;gp inhibitor is emerging as a promising strategy to realize Taxol's oral delivery. Because P&#8208;gp exists in many tissues, the non&#8208;selective P&#8208;gp inhibitors would lead to toxicity. Correspondingly, a potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor would be an ideal solution to boost the oral absorption of Taxol and avoid exogenous toxicity. Herein, we would like to report a highly potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor to enable oral delivery of Taxol in high efficiency. Through a multicomponent reaction and post&#8208;modification, various benzofuran&#8208;fused&#8208;piperidine derivatives were achieved and the biological evaluation identified 16&#8201;c with potent P&#8208;gp inhibitory activity. Notably, 16&#8201;c was intestine specific and showed almost none absorption (F=0.82&#8201;%), but possessing higher efficacy than Encequidar to improve the oral absorption of Taxol. In MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 xenograft model, the oral administration of Taxol and 16&#8201;c showed high therapeutic efficiency and low toxicity, thus providing a valuable chemotherapy strategy.

         <title>Stable Meisenheimer Complexes as Powerful Photoreductants Readily Obtained from Aza&#8208;Hetero Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong reducing systems (&#8804;3.0&#8197;V vs SCE) can be obtained simply and practically by adding nBuLi to available heterocyclic compounds (pyridine, isoquinoline, etc) and using them under irradiation at 456&#8197;nm. Strong photoreductans obtained are capable of reducing electron&#8208;rich arylchlorides.







Abstract
Excited states of radical anions derived from the photoreduction of stable organic molecules are suggested to serve as potent reductants. However, excited states of these species are too short&#8208;lived to allow bimolecular quenching processes. Recently, the singlet excited state of Meisenheimer complexes, which possess a long&#8208;lived excited state, was identified as the competent species for the reduction of challenging organic substrates (&#8722;2.63&#8197;V vs. SCE, saturated calomel electrode). To produce reasonably stable and simply accessible different Meisenheimer complexes, the addition of nBuLi to readily available aromatic heterocycles was investigated, and the photoreactivity of the generated species was studied. In this paper, we present the straightforward preparation of a family of powerful photoreductants (*Eox&lt;&#8722;3&#8197;V vs. SCE in their excited states, determined by DFT and time&#8208;dependent TD&#8208;DFT calculations; DFT, density functional theory) that can induce dehalogenation of electron&#8208;rich aryl chlorides and to form C&#8722;C bond through radical cyclization. Photophysical analyses and computational studies in combination with experimental mechanistic investigations demonstrate the ability of the adduct to act as a strong electron donor under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Optimizing the Intermediates Adsorption by Manipulating the Second Coordination Shell of Ir Single Atoms for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents Ir single atoms anchored on NiO via different bonding strategies, resulting in diverse Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination numbers for Ir sites. The OER activity exhibited a volcano&#8208;shaped relationship with the Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination number. The improved activity of Ir1&#8722;NiO was attributed to the moderate coordination number of Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni, which weakened the adsorption strength for *OOH intermediates.







Abstract
The precise regulation of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with the desired local chemical environment is vital to elucidate the relationship between the SACs structure and the catalytic performance. The debate on the effect of the local coordination environment is quite complicated even for the SACs with the same composition and chemical nature, calling for increased attention on the regulation of the second coordination shell. For oxide&#8208;supported SACs, it remains a significant challenge to precisely manipulate the second coordination shell of single atoms supported on oxides due to the structural robustness of oxides. Here, Ir single atoms were anchored on NiO supports via different bonding strategies, resulting in the diverse Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination numbers for Ir sites. Specifically, Ir1/NiO, Ir1&#8722;NiO, and Ir1@NiO SACs with increasing Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination numbers of 3, 4, and 5 were synthesized, respectively. We found that the activity of the three samples towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) exhibited a volcano&#8208;shaped relationship with the Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination number, with Ir1&#8722;NiO showing the lowest overpotential of 225&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Mechanism investigations indicate that the moderate coordination number of Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni in Ir1&#8722;NiO creates the higher occupied Ir dz2 orbital, weakening the adsorption strength for *OOH intermediates and thereby enhancing the OER activity.

         <title>Integration of Perylene Diimide into a Covalent Organic Framework for Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent organic framework based on perylene diimide (PDI&#8208;PDA) has been synthesized and characterized. Its photocatalytic efficiency in thioether oxidation to sulfoxide compounds was more than ten&#8208;fold higher than that of PDI&#8208;PH. The enhanced electron&#8208;induced O2 activation under visible light was due to improved charge separation and transfer.







Abstract
Perylene diimides (PDIs) have garnered considerable attention due to their immense potential in photocatalysis. However, manipulating the molecular packing within their aggregates and enhancing the efficiency of photogenerated carrier recombination remain significant challenges. In this study, we demonstrate the incorporation of a PDI unit into a covalent organic framework (COF), named PDI&#8208;PDA, by linking an ortho&#8208;substituted PDI with p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PDA) to control its intermolecular aggregation. The incorporation enables precise modulation of electron&#8208;transfer dynamics, leading to a ten&#8208;fold increase in the efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation of thioether to sulfoxide with PDI&#8208;PDA compared to the PDI molecular counterpart, with yields exceeding 90&#8201;%. Electron property studies and density functional theory calculations show that the PDI&#8208;PDA with its well&#8208;defined crystal structure, enhances &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and lowers the electron transition barrier. Moreover, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the PDI unit promotes the spatial separation of the valency band maximum and conduction band minimum of PDI&#8208;PDA, suppressing the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and improving the charge&#8208;separation efficiency to give high photocatalytic efficiency. This study provides a brief but effective way for improving the photocatalytic efficiency of commonly used PDI&#8208;based dyes by integrating them into a framework skeleton.

         <title>Cone Angles Quantify and Predict the Affinity and Reactivity of Anion Complexes between Trifluoroborates and Rigid Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cone angles of anions correlate with the affinity and reactivity of their complexes akin to Tolman cone angles seen in cation coordination. This behavior is exemplified with binding rigid organo&#8208;trifluoroborate (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;) anions to rigid cyanostar macrocycles and expected to be general for other rigid pairs. Use of cone angles allow predictions, with affinities agreeing to within 5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Steric manipulation is a known concept in molecular recognition but there is currently no linear free energy relationship correlating sterics to the stability of receptor&#8208;anion complexes nor to the reactivity of the bound anion. By analogy to Tolman cone angles in cation coordination chemistry, we explore how to define and correlate cone angles of organo&#8208;trifluoroborates (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;) to the affinities observed for cyanostar&#8208;anion binding. We extend the analogy to a rare investigation of the anion's reactivity and how it changes upon binding. The substituent on the anion is used to define the cone angle, &#952;. A series of 10&#8197;anions were studied including versions with ethynyl, ethylene, and ethyl substituents to tune steric bulk across the sp, sp2 and sp3 hybridized &#945;&#8208;carbons bearing 0, 1 and 2&#8197;hydrogen atoms. A linear relationship between affinity and cone angle is observed for anions bearing substituents larger than the &#8722;BF3&#8722; headgroup. This correlation predicted affinities of two new anions to within &#177;5&#8201;%. We explored how complexation affects the reactivity of fluoride exchange. The yield of fluoride transfer from R&#8722;BF3&#8722; to Lewis acid triphenylborane is correlated with cone angle. We predict that other rigid macrocycles, like commercially available bambusuril, could follow these trends.

         <title>Aerodynamically Levitated Droplets as Small&#8208;Scale Chemical Reactors and Liquid Microprinters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplets of various solvents can levitate for days to weeks over the same or another liquid spread over the walls of a rotating vial. Individual or multiple droplets can be levitated, and can be used as &#8220;airware&#8221; reactors or as &#8220;wireless&#8221; chemical printers requiring no external connections to deliver into a reaction mixture fL volumes and pg quantities of reagents.







Abstract
A thin liquid film spread over the inner surface of a rapidly rotating vial creates an aerodynamic cushion on which one or multiple droplets of various liquids can levitate stably for days or even weeks. These levitating droplets can serve as wall&#8208;less (&#8220;airware&#8221;) chemical reactors that can be merged without touching&#8212;by remote impulses&#8212;to initiate reactions or sequences of reactions at scales down to hundreds of nanomoles. Moreover, under external electric fields, the droplets can act as the world's smallest chemical printers, shedding regular trains of pL or even fL microdrops. In one modality, the levitating droplets operate as completely wireless aliquoting/titrating systems delivering pg quantities of reagents into the liquid in the rotating vial; in another modality, they print microdroplet arrays onto target surfaces.

     alt="Aerodynamically Levitated Droplets as Small-Scale Chemical Reactors and Liquid Microprinters"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Droplets of various solvents can levitate for days to weeks over the same or another liquid spread over the walls of a rotating vial. Individual or multiple droplets can be levitated, and can be used as &#8220;airware&#8221; reactors or as &#8220;wireless&#8221; chemical printers requiring no external connections to deliver into a reaction mixture fL volumes and pg quantities of reagents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thin liquid film spread over the inner surface of a rapidly rotating vial creates an aerodynamic cushion on which one or multiple droplets of various liquids can levitate stably for days or even weeks. These levitating droplets can serve as wall-less (&#8220;airware&#8221;) chemical reactors that can be merged without touching&#8212;by remote impulses&#8212;to initiate reactions or sequences of reactions at scales down to hundreds of nanomoles. Moreover, under external electric fields, the droplets can act as the world's smallest chemical printers, shedding regular trains of pL or even fL microdrops. In one modality, the levitating droplets operate as completely wireless aliquoting/titrating systems delivering pg quantities of reagents into the liquid in the rotating vial; in another modality, they print microdroplet arrays onto target surfaces. The &#8220;airware&#8221;, levitated reactors are inexpensive to set up, remarkably stable to external disturbances and, for printing applications, require operating voltages much lower than in electrospray, electrowetting, or ink jet systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bifunctional Chiral Electrocatalysts Enable Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel designed bifunctional chiral electrocatalyst has been presented for the asymmetric electrochemical &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes. The new bifunctional catalyst, which combines a chiral aminocatalyst with a redox mediator, significantly enhances efficiencies and stereoselectivities compared to conventional catalysts. It plays a dual role as a redox mediator for electrooxidation while simultaneously providing remarkable asymmetric induction for the stereoselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes.







Abstract
Herein, we describe an innovative approach to the asymmetric electrochemical &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes facilitated by a newly designed bifunctional chiral electrocatalyst. The highly efficient bifunctional chiral electrocatalyst combines a chiral aminocatalyst with a redox mediator. It plays a dual role as a redox mediator for electrooxidation, while simultaneously providing remarkable asymmetric induction for the stereoselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes. Additionally, this novel catalyst exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and excellent stereoselective control comparable to conventional catalytic systems. As a result, this strategy provides a new avenue for versatile asymmetric electrochemistry. The electrooxidation of diverse phenols enables the C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H oxidative &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes in a highly chemo&#8208; and stereoselective fashion. Detailed mechanistic studies by control experiments and cyclic voltammetry analysis demonstrate possible reaction pathways and the origin of enantio&#8208;induction.

         <title>Blade&#8208;Coating (100)&#8208;Oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Perovskite Films via Crystal Surface Energy Regulation for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>

Regulating the crystal surface energy and optimizing the crystallization dynamics realized blade&#8208;coating of (100)&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 for 24.16&#8201;% efficient inverted perovskite solar cells with extended lifespan.







Abstract
Photoactive black&#8208;phase formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) perovskite has dominated the prevailing high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), normally for those spin&#8208;coated, conventional n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured devices. Unfortunately, &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 has not been made full use of its advantages in inverted p&#8208;i&#8208;n structured PSCs fabricated via blade&#8208;coating techniques owing to uncontrollable crystallization kinetics and complicated phase evolution of FAPbI3 perovskites during film formation. Herein, a customized crystal surface energy regulation strategy has been innovatively developed by incorporating 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of N&#8208;aminoethylpiperazine hydroiodide (NAPI) additive into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystal&#8208;derived perovskite ink, which enabled the formation of highly&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films. We deciphered the phase transformation mechanisms and crystallization kinetics of blade&#8208;coated &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films via combining a series of in&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. Interestingly, the strong chemical interactions between the NAPI and inorganic Pb&#8722;I framework help to reduce the surface energy of (100) crystal plane by 42&#8201;%, retard the crystallization rate and lower the formation energy of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Benefited from multifaceted advantages of promoted charge extraction and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination, the resultant blade&#8208;coated inverted PSCs based on (100)&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films realized promising efficiencies up to 24.16&#8201;% (~26.5&#8201;% higher than that of the randomly&#8208;oriented counterparts), accompanied by improved operational stability. This result represented one of the best performances reported to date for FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs fabricated via scalable deposition methods.

         <title>Bidentate Coordination Structure Facilitates High&#8208;Voltage and High&#8208;Utilization Aqueous Zn&#8722;I2 Batteries</title>

Trimethylamine hydrochloride (TAH) stabilizes the Zn anode by promoting the desolvation process and shielding mechanism, enabling stable cycling of the Zn anode with a maximum area capacity of 57&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a ZUR of 97&#8201;%. At the same time, a stable high&#8208;valence iodine cathode in the four&#8208;electron transfer I&#8722;/I2/I+ reaction is achieved through a bidentate coordination structure of (TA)ICl. The four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer aqueous Zn&#8722;I2 full cell achieves 5000 stable cycles at an N/P ratio of 2.5.







Abstract
The aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine battery is a promising energy storage device, but the conventional two&#8208;electron reaction potential and energy density of the iodine cathode are far from meeting practical application requirements. Given that iodine is rich in redox reactions, activating the high&#8208;valence iodine cathode reaction has become a promising research direction for developing high&#8208;voltage zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. In this work, by designing a multifunctional electrolyte additive trimethylamine hydrochloride (TAH), a stable high&#8208;valence iodine cathode in four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer I&#8722;/I2/I+ reactions with a high theoretical specific capacity is achieved through a unique amine group, Cl bidentate coordination structure of (TA)ICl. Characterization techniques such as synchrotron radiation, in situ Raman spectra, and DFT calculations are used to verify the mechanism of the stable bidentate structure. This electrolyte additive stabilizes the zinc anode by promoting the desolvation process and shielding mechanism, enabling the zinc anode to cycle steadily at a maximum areal capacity of 57&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 97&#8201;% zinc utilization rate. Finally, the four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer aqueous Zn&#8722;I2 full cell achieves 5000 stable cycles at an N/P ratio of 2.5. The unique bidentate coordination structure contributes to the further development of high&#8208;valence and high capacity aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Assisted Supercapacitive Swing Adsorption of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) with 15&#8201;% CO2/5&#8201;% O2/80&#8201;% N2 gas mixture and achieve 11&#8197;times higher sorption capacities with MgBr2 and 4&#8211;5&#8197;times higher sorption capacities with MgCl2 compared to 15&#8201;% CO2/85&#8201;% N2 gas mixture. A tradeoff between sorption capacity and energy efficiency was observed.







Abstract
We report on the supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) of carbon dioxide at different voltage windows in the presence of oxygen using activated carbon electrodes, and deliquescent, aqueous electrolytes. The presence of O2 in the CO2/N2 gas mixture results in an up to 11&#8197;times higher CO2 adsorption capacity with 3&#8197;M MgBr2 (at 0.6&#8197;V) and up to 4&#8211;5&#8197;times higher adsorption capacity with 3&#8197;M MgCl2 (at 1&#8197;V). A tradeoff between high CO2 adsorption capacities and lower coulombic efficiencies was observed at voltages above 0.6&#8197;V. The energetic and adsorptive performance of the electrodes in the presence of oxygen below 0.5&#8197;V was similar to the performance with a CO2/N2 mixture without oxygen at 1&#8197;V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the electrodes demonstrate that the specific capacitance increases while the diffusion resistance decreases in the presence of oxygen. Oxygen concentrations ranging between 5&#8211;20&#8201;% give similar energetic and adsorptive performance. The electrodes exhibit stable performance for up to 100&#8197;cycles of operation.

         <title>Intramolecular Electrostatic Interactions Regulate Reactivity of Zwitterionic Functionalities in Amphiphilic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular electrostatic stabilization in zwitterionic moieties plays a critical role in their reactive stability. The stabilization potential is demonstrated to have a unique spatial orientation dependence in zwitterionic head groups of surfactants and lipids. This feature has been used to generate triggerable supramolecular assembly formation and their disassembly.







Abstract
The consequences of intramolecular ionic interactions in determining the reactivity of functional groups are of interest because they provide insights into how nature deploys seemingly reactive functionalities to be rather ubiquitous. Of specific interest are the quaternary ammonium ions in lipids. In this work, we investigate the effect of intramolecular electrostatic interactions in zwitterionic functionalities by judiciously incorporating them as leaving groups at the &#945;&#8208;position of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ester&#8208;based lipid head groups. We find that electrostatic stabilization indeed plays a critical role in both the reaction kinetics with nucleophiles and the thermodynamics of lipid formation. We further leverage these findings to fabricate both triggerable assembly and disassembly of liposomal supramolecular assemblies in the presence of nucleophiles.

         <title>Green Syngas Production from Natural Lignin, Sunlight, and Water over Pt&#8208;Decorated InGaN Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven green syngas production from natural lignin and water is achieved over Pt&#8208;decorated InGaN nanowires supported by a silicon substrate. Photo&#8208;excited charges play a critical role in the generation of &#8901;CH3 from lignin and &#8901;OH from water, followed by the formation of syngas. The study shows a promising route for the carbon&#8208;neutral production of transportation fuels and valuable chemicals beyond fossil fuels.







Abstract
Transformation of lignin to syngas can turn waste into treasure yet remains a tremendous challenge because of its naturally evolved stubborn structure. In this work, light&#8208;driven reforming of natural lignin in water for green syngas production is explored using Pt&#8208;decorated InGaN nanowires. The spectroscopic characterizations, isotope, and model compound experiments, as well as density function theory calculation, disclose that among a variety of groups including aromatic ring, &#8722;OH, &#8722;OCH3, &#8722;C3H7 with complex chemical bonds of O&#8722;H, C&#8722;H, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, etc., InGaN nanowires are cooperative with Pt for preferably breaking the C&#8722;O bond of the rich O&#8722;CH3 group in lignin to liberating &#8901;CH3 by photogenerated holes with a minimum dissociation energy of 2.33&#8197;eV. Syngas are subsequently yielded from the continuous evolution of &#8901;CH3 and &#8901;OH from photocatalytic reforming of lignin in water. Together with the superior optoelectronic attributes of Pt&#8208;decorated InGaN nanowires, the evolution rate of syngas approaches 43.4&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with tunable H2/CO ratios and a remarkable turnover number (TON) of 150, 543&#8197;mol syngas per mol Pt. Notably, the architecture demonstrates a high light efficiency of 12.1&#8201;% for syngas generation under focused light without any extra thermal input. Outdoor test ascertains the viability of producing syngas with the only inputs of natural lignin, water, and sunlight, thus presenting a low&#8208;carbon route for synthesizing transportation fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Chemical Reaction Modulated Low&#8208;Dimensional Phase Toward Highly Efficient Sky&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional azure perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), with a peak external quantum efficiency of more than 16&#8201;%, are developed by optimizing the energy cascade process between low&#8208;dimensional phases, regarding defect passivation and phase distribution regulation, through the inclusion of multifunctional molecular additives.







Abstract
Blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are crucial avenues for achieving full&#8208;color displays and lighting based on perovskite materials. However, the relatively low external quantum efficiency (EQE) has hindered their progression towards commercial applications. Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskites stand out as promising candidates for blue PeLEDs, with optimized control over low&#8208;dimensional phases contributing to enhanced radiative properties of excitons. Herein, the impact of organic molecular dopants on the crystallization of various n&#8208;phase structures in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. The results reveal that the highly reactive bis(4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)phosphine oxide (BTF&#8208;PPO) molecule could effectively restrain the formation of organic spacer cation&#8208;ordered layered perovskite phases through chemical reactions, simultaneously passivate those uncoordinated Pb2+ defects. Consequently, the prepared PeLEDs exhibited a maximum EQE of 16.6&#8201;% (@ 490&#8197;nm). The finding provides a new route to design dopant molecules for phase modulation in quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs.

         <title>A Tetracarbene Iron(II) Complex with a Long&#8208;lived Triplet Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer State due to a Triplet&#8208;Triplet Barrier</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3MLCT&#8594;3MC barrier determines the excited state lifetime of iron(II) photosensitizers. In the specifically designed tetracarbene iron(II) complex with cis&#8208;coordinated pyridines, a single Fe&#8722;N bond elongates in the excited triplet states. Variable&#8208;temperature ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy delivered the barrier and the electronic coupling between 3MLCT and 3MC states providing novel design criteria for iron(II) sensitizers.







Abstract
Mixed N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) / pyridyl iron(II) complexes have attracted a great deal of attention recently because of their potential as photocatalysts and light sensitizers made from Earth&#8208;abundant elements. The most decisive challenge for their successful implementation is the lifetime of the lowest triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer state (3MLCT), which typically decays via a triplet metal&#8208;centered (3MC) state back to the ground state. We reveal by variable&#8208;temperature ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy that the tripodal iron(II) bis(pyridine) complex isomers trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;[Fe(pdmi)2]2+ with four NHC donors show 3MLCT&#8594;3MC population transfers with very different barriers and rationalize this by computational means. While trans&#8208;[Fe(pdmi)2]2+ possesses an unobservable activation barrier, the cis isomer exhibits a barrier of 492&#8197;cm&#8722;1, which leads to a nanosecond 3MLCT lifetime at 77&#8197;K. The kinetic and quantum chemical data were analyzed in the context of semi&#8208;classical Marcus theory revealing a high reorganization energy and small electronic coupling between the two triplet states.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MLCT&#8594;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MC barrier determines the excited state lifetime of iron(II) photosensitizers. In the specifically designed tetracarbene iron(II) complex with &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-coordinated pyridines, a single Fe&#8722;N bond elongates in the excited triplet states. Variable-temperature ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy delivered the barrier and the electronic coupling between &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MLCT and &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MC states providing novel design criteria for iron(II) sensitizers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) / pyridyl iron(II) complexes have attracted a great deal of attention recently because of their potential as photocatalysts and light sensitizers made from Earth-abundant elements. The most decisive challenge for their successful implementation is the lifetime of the lowest triplet metal-to-ligand charge transfer state (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MLCT), which typically decays via a triplet metal-centered (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MC) state back to the ground state. We reveal by variable-temperature ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy that the tripodal iron(II) bis(pyridine) complex isomers &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;trans&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;cis&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-[Fe(pdmi)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; with four NHC donors show &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MLCT&#8594;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MC population transfers with very different barriers and rationalize this by computational means. While &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;trans&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-[Fe(pdmi)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; possesses an unobservable activation barrier, the cis isomer exhibits a barrier of 492&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which leads to a nanosecond &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MLCT lifetime at 77&#8197;K. The kinetic and quantum chemical data were analyzed in the context of semi-classical Marcus theory revealing a high reorganization energy and small electronic coupling between the two triplet states. This highlights the importance of detailed structural control and kinetic knowledge for the rational design of photosensitizers from first row transition metals such as iron.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Two polymorphic copper&#8208;based hybrid halides &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 with broadband&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy visible light emission were obtained. The centrosymmetric to noncentroysmmetic structural transformation between them is induced by the distortion of [CuI3] triangular anions and packing mode of organic cations. Especially, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 exhibits multi&#8208;properties including bright cyan emission with 100&#8201;% PLQY, phase&#8208;matchable SHG effect and outstanding X&#8208;ray scintillation properties.







Abstract
Designing and synthesizing multifunctional hybrid copper halides with near ultraviolet (NUV) light&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy emission (&lt;500&#8197;nm) remains challenging. Here, a pair of broadband&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy emitting isomers, namely, &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 (MePh3P=methyltriphenylphosphonium), were synthesized. &#945;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 with blue emission peaking at 475&#8197;nm is firstly discovered wherein its structure contains regular [CuI3]2&#8722; triangles and crystallizes in centrosymmetric space group P21/c. While &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 featuring distorted [CuI3]2&#8722; planar triangles shows inversion symmetry breaking and crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group P21, which exhibits cyan emission peaking at 495&#8197;nm with prominent near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield and the excitation band ranging from 200 to 450&#8197;nm. Intriguingly, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 exhibits phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation response of 0.54&#215;KDP and a suitable birefringence of 0.06@1064&#8197;nm. Furthermore, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 also can be excited by X&#8208;ray radioluminescence with a high scintillation light yield of 16193 photon/MeV and an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 47.97 nGy/s, which is only 0.87&#8201;% of the standard medical diagnosis (5.5&#8197;&#956;Gy/s). This work not only promotes the development of solid&#8208;state lighting, laser frequency conversion and X&#8208;ray imaging, but also provides a reference for constructing multifunctional hybrid metal halides.

         <title>Functionalized Thienopyrazines on NiOx Film as Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Efficient Tin&#8208;Perovskite Solar Cells Using a Two&#8208;Step Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three thienopyrazine&#8208;based organic molecules as self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) were developed and deposited on NiOx films for tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells. Using NiOx as interlayer can modify the hydrophilicity and surface roughness of the ITO substrate. The two&#8208;step method was applied to enable better quality of the tin perovskite layer grown on the NiOx/SAM substrates, ultimately achieving a power conversion efficiency of 7.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Three functionalized thienopyrazines (TPs), TP&#8208;MN (1), TP&#8208;CA (2), and TPT&#8208;MN (3) were designed and synthesized as self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) deposited on the NiOx film for tin&#8208;perovskite solar cells (TPSCs). Thermal, optical, electrochemical, morphological, crystallinity, hole mobility, and charge recombination properties, as well as DFT&#8208;derived energy levels with electrostatic surface potential mapping of these SAMs, have been thoroughly investigated and discussed. The structure of the TP&#8208;MN (1) single crystal was successfully grown and analyzed to support the uniform SAM produced on the ITO/NiOx substrate. When we used NiOx as HTM in TPSC, the device showed poor performance. To improve the efficiency of TPSC, we utilized a combination of new organic SAMs with NiOx as HTM, the TPSC device exhibited the highest PCE of 7.7&#8201;% for TP&#8208;MN (1). Hence, the designed NiOx/TP&#8208;MN (1) acts as a new model system for the development of efficient SAM&#8208;based TPSC. To the best of our knowledge, the combination of organic SAMs with anchoring CN/CN or CN/COOH groups and NiOx as HTM for TPSC has never been reported elsewhere. The TPSC device based on the NiOx/TP&#8208;MN bilayer exhibits great enduring stability for performance, retaining ~80&#8201;% of its original value for shelf storage over 4000&#8197;h.

         <title>Ultrafast and Coherent Dynamics in a Solvent Switchable &#8220;Pink Box&#8221; Perylene Diimide Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast coherent multidimensional spectroscopy probes photoinduced dynamics in a covalent perylene diimide (PDI) dimer exhibiting solvent&#8208;controlled on/off excitonic coupling. Excitonic coupling leads to ultrafast excimer formation. The coupling dependent population and vibrationally coherent dynamics in the two cases are measured and discussed in the context of controlling PDI dimer photophysics.







Abstract
Perylene diimide (PDI) dimers and higher aggregates are key components in organic molecular photonics and photovoltaic devices, supporting singlet fission and symmetry breaking charge separation. Detailed understanding of their excited states is thus important. This has proven challenging because interchromophoric coupling is a strong function of dimer architecture. Recently, a macrocyclic PDI dimer was reported in which excitonic coupling could be turned on and off simply by changing the solvent. This presents a useful case where coupling is modified without synthetic changes to tune supramolecular structure. Here we present a detailed study of solvent dependent excited state dynamics in this dimer by means of coherent multidimensional spectroscopy. Spectral analysis resolves the different coupling strengths, which are consistent with solvent dependent changes in dimer conformation. The strongly coupled conformer forms an excimer within 300&#8197;fs. The low&#8208;frequency Raman active modes recovered from two&#8208;dimensional electronic spectra reveal frequencies characteristic of exciton coupling. These are assigned to modes modulating the coupling from the corresponding DFT calculations. Further analysis reveals a time dependent frequency during excimer formation. Analysis of two&#8208;dimensional &#8220;beatmaps&#8221; reveals features in the coupled dimer which are not predicted by the displaced harmonic oscillator model and are assigned to vibronic coupling.

         <title>Cavity&#8208;Partitioned Self&#8208;Assembled Cage for Sequential Separation in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The partitioned cavity of cage 1 demonstrates a high degree of molecular&#8208;specific recognition, enabling its application not only in the separation of adamantane derivatives but also in the progressive separation of multi&#8208;component polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Moreover, the reversible binding between the redox&#8208;active guest and 1 is achieved through precise regulation of the reduction/oxidation state of the guest via electrochemical stimulation.







Abstract
The concept of pore space partition has emerged as an effective strategy for developing improved coordination&#8208;based supramolecular porous materials with exceptional performance. Herein, we report that a water&#8208;soluble self&#8208;assembled tetrahedral cage 1 with a partitioned cavity shown excellent performance as a multifunctional extractant. The results show that this unique partitioned cavity can efficiently separate halogenated adamantanes, adamantane isomers, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the influence of cavity&#8208;partitioned cage 1 on the electrochemical properties of redox&#8208;active molecules and electrochemically driven reversible host&#8211;guest process has also been demonstrated. The findings offer valuable insights into the design and development of new type of materials with controlled phase separation and tailored electrochemical properties.

17&#8208;nor&#8208;Cephalotane diterpenoids include two categories, Cephalotaxus troponoids and tropone&#8208;free 17&#8208;nor&#8208;cephalotane diterpenoids, which possess polycyclic frameworks with seven&#8208;membered A ring bearing different oxidation states. We report herein a novel ynol&#8208;diene cyclization as a rapid access to tropone unit. Combining with a bioinspired stereoselective dual hydrogenation, the first divergent strategy to both categories of 17&#8208;nor&#8208;cephalotane diterpenoids has been successfully established, which enabled the total synthesis of Cephalotaxus troponoids, (+)&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyfortalpinoid F and (+)&#8208;harringtonolide, and tropone&#8208;free 17&#8208;nor&#8208;cephalotane diterpenoids, (&#8722;)&#8208;fortalpinoids M/N/P and analog (&#8722;)&#8208;20&#8208;deoxocephinoid P, in 14&#8211;17 linear longest steps starting from commercially available materials.

         <title>Allenamides as a Powerful Tool to Incorporate Diversity: Thia&#8208;Michael Lipidation of Semisynthetic Peptides and Access to &#946;&#8208;Keto Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allenamides are demonstrated as a peptide modification tool that enables late&#8208;stage access to chemically diverse bioactive lipopeptides prepared by semisynthesis and to &#946;&#8208;keto amide&#8208;functionalised peptides, which serve as versatile building blocks for further derivatisation.







Abstract
Lipopeptides are an important class of biomolecules for drug development. Compared with conventional acylation, a chemoselective lipidation strategy offers a more efficient strategy for late&#8208;stage structural derivatisation of a peptide scaffold. It provides access to chemically diverse compounds possessing intriguing and non&#8208;native moieties. Utilising an allenamide, we report the first semisynthesis of antimicrobial lipopeptides leveraging a highly efficient thia&#8208;Michael addition of chemically diverse lipophilic thiols. Using chemoenzymatically prepared polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) as a model scaffold, an optimised allenamide&#8208;mediated thia&#8208;Michael addition effected rapid and near quantitative lipidation, affording vinyl sulfide&#8208;linked lipopeptide derivatives. Harnessing the utility of this new methodology, 22&#8197;lipophilic thiols of unprecedented chemical diversity were introduced to the PMBN framework. These included alkyl thiols, substituted aromatic thiols, heterocyclic thiols and those bearing additional functional groups (e.g., amines), ultimately yielding analogues with potent Gram&#8208;negative antimicrobial activity and substantially attenuated nephrotoxicity. Furthermore, we report facile routes to transform the allenamide into a &#946;&#8208;keto amide on unprotected peptides, offering a powerful &#8220;jack&#8208;of&#8208;all&#8208;trades&#8221; synthetic intermediate to enable further peptide modification.

         <title>Unraveling the Origin of Multichannel Circularly Polarized Luminescence in a Pyrene&#8208;Functionalized Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved circularly polarized luminescence (TRCPL) spectroscopy combined with transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy has been used to elucidate the origins of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emission in pyrene&#8208;functionalized topologically chiral [2]catenane. This approach enabled elucidation of the chiroptical signals originating from either the topological or Euclidean chirality in these chiral molecules.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) are promising platforms for developing functionalized artificial molecular machines. The construction of chiral MIMs with appealing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties has boosted their potential application in biomedicine and the optical industry. However, there is currently little knowledge about the CPL emission mechanism or the emission dynamics of these related MIMs. Herein, we demonstrate that time&#8208;resolved circularly polarized luminescence (TRCPL) spectroscopy combined with transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy offers a feasible approach to elucidate the origins of CPL emission in pyrene&#8208;functionalized topologically chiral [2]catenane as well as in a series of pyrene&#8208;functionalized chiral molecules. For the first time, direct evidence differentiating the chiroptical signals originating from either topological (local state emission) or Euclidean chirality (excimer state emission) in these pyrene&#8208;functionalized chiral molecules has been discovered. Our work not only establishes a novel and ideal approach to study CPL mechanism, but also provides a theoretical foundation for the rational design of novel chiral materials in the future.

         <title>Photocatalytic Formamide Synthesis via Coupling of Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Radicals over Atomically Dispersed Bi Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient formamide synthesis from ammonia and methanol was achieved through photocatalysis on Bi single atoms (BiSAs) loaded TiO2. The key C&#8722;N coupling interactions were demonstrated to be the &#8220;&#963;&#8211;&#963;&#8221; interaction between the electrophilic &#8901;CH2OH radical and nucleophilic &#8901;NH2 radical by combining in situ characterizations, isotopic labeling and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Formamide (HCONH2) plays a pivotal role in the manufacture of a diverse array of chemicals, fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals. Photocatalysis holds great promise for green fabrication of carbon&#8208;nitrogen (C&#8722;N) compounds owing to its environmental friendliness and mild redox capability. However, the selective formation of the C&#8722;N bond presents a significant challenge in the photocatalytic synthesis of C&#8722;N compounds. This work developed a photocatalytic radical coupling method for the formamide synthesis from co&#8208;oxidation of ammonia (NH3) and methanol (CH3OH). An exceptional formamide yield rate of 5.47&#177;0.03&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 (911.87&#177;5&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gBi&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) was achieved over atomically dispersed Bi sites (BiSAs) on TiO2. An accumulation of 45.68&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 (2.0&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1) of formamide was achieved after long&#8208;term illumination, representing the highest level of photocatalytic C&#8722;N compounds synthesis. The critical C&#8722;N coupling for formamide formation originated from the &#8220;&#963;&#8211;&#963;&#8221; interaction between electrophilic &#8901;CH2OH with nucleophilic &#8901;NH2 radical. The BiSAs sites facilitated the electron transfer between reactants and photocatalysts and enhanced the nucleophilic attack of &#8901;NH2 radical on the &#8901;CH2OH radical, thereby advancing the selective C&#8722;N bond formation. This work deepens the understanding of the C&#8722;N coupling mechanism and offers an intriguing photocatalytic approach for the efficient and sustainable production of C&#8722;N compounds.

&lt;p&gt;Efficient formamide synthesis from ammonia and methanol was achieved through photocatalysis on Bi single atoms (Bi&lt;sub&gt;SAs&lt;/sub&gt;) loaded TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The key C&#8722;N coupling interactions were demonstrated to be the &#8220;&#963;&#8211;&#963;&#8221; interaction between the electrophilic &#8901;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH radical and nucleophilic &#8901;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; radical by combining in situ characterizations, isotopic labeling and theoretical calculations.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formamide (HCONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) plays a pivotal role in the manufacture of a diverse array of chemicals, fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals. Photocatalysis holds great promise for green fabrication of carbon-nitrogen (C&#8722;N) compounds owing to its environmental friendliness and mild redox capability. However, the selective formation of the C&#8722;N bond presents a significant challenge in the photocatalytic synthesis of C&#8722;N compounds. This work developed a photocatalytic radical coupling method for the formamide synthesis from co-oxidation of ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and methanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH).

         <title>Nonreducing Sugar Scaffold Enables the Development of Immunomodulatory TLR4&#8208;specific LPS Mimetics with Picomolar Potency</title>

Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system play a central role in host defense and in the modulation of immune responses in infection, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Of the PRRs, Toll&#8208;like Receptors (TLR) are particularly important targets for the development of immunotherapies in a variety of inflammatory and oncological settings. TLR4&#8208;specific carbohydrate&#8208;based biomolecules capable of potently activating cellular responses or inhibiting TLR4&#8208;mediated inflammation were designed, chemically synthesised and immunobiologically evaluated.







Abstract
Innate immune defense mechanisms against infection and cancer encompass the modulation of pattern recognition receptor (PRR)&#8208;mediated inflammation, including upregulation of various transcription factors and the activation of pro&#8208;inflammatory pathways important for immune surveillance. Dysfunction of PRRs&#8208;mediated signaling has been implicated in cancer and autoimmune diseases, while the overactivation of PRRs&#8208;driven responses during infection can lead to devastating consequences such as acute lung injury or sepsis. We used crystal structure&#8208;based design to develop immunomodulatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mimetics targeting one of the ubiquitous PRRs, Toll&#8208;like Receptor 4 (TLR4). Taking advantage of an exo&#8208;anomeric conformation and specific molecular shape of synthetic nonreducing &#946;,&#946;&#8208;diglucosamine, which was investigated by NMR, we developed two sets of lipid A mimicking glycolipids capable of either potently activating innate immune responses or inhibiting pro&#8208;inflammatory signaling. Stereoselective 1,1&#8242;&#8208;glycosylation towards fully orthogonally protected nonreducing GlcN&#946;(1&#8596;1&#8242;)&#946;GlcN followed by stepwise assembly of differently functionalised phosphorylated glycolipids provided biologically active molecules that were evaluated for their ability to trigger or to inhibit cellular innate immune responses. Two LPS mimetics, identified as potent TLR4&#8208;specific inducers of the intracellular signaling pathways, serve as vaccine adjuvant&#8208; and immunotherapy candidates, while anionic glycolipids with TLR4&#8208;inhibitory potential hold therapeutic promise for the management of acute or chronic inflammation.

An endoperoxide compound (E5) spontaneously deliver three active agents and target multiple mechanisms for treating non&#8208;small cell lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Many lines of evidence reveal the therapeutic efficacy of singlet oxygen and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone. In addition, triplet oxygen could downregulate HIF&#8208;1&#945; and relieve tumor hypoxia which is an important issue in many refractory cancers.







Abstract
We report an endoperoxide compound (E5) which can deliver three therapeutic components by a thermal cycloreversion, namely, singlet oxygen, triplet oxygen and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone (P5), thus targeting multiple mechanisms for treating non&#8208;small cell lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In aqueous environment, E5 undergoes clean reaction to afford three therapeutic components with a half&#8208;life of 8.3&#8197;hours without the generation of other by&#8208;products, which not only achieves good cytotoxicity toward lung cancer cells and decreases the levels of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) protein, but also inhibits the transforming growth factor &#946;1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1) induced fibrosis in vitro. In vivo experiments also demonstrated the efficacy of E5 in inhibiting tumor growth and relieving idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, while exhibiting good biocompatibility. Many lines of evidence reveal the therapeutic efficacy of singlet oxygen and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone for these two lung diseases, and triplet oxygen could downregulate HIF&#8208;1&#945; and relieve tumor hypoxia which is a critical issue in photodynamic therapy (PDT). Unlike other combination therapies, in which multiple therapeutic agents are given in independent formulations, our work demonstrates single molecule endoperoxide prodrugs could be developed as new platforms for treatment of cancers and related diseases.

         <title>Taming Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymerization by a Machine&#8208;Learning Discovered Crystallization Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning approach is used to derive a non&#8208;classical model that describes the crystallization of two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) in a homogeneous solution. This model reveals that gradually increasing monomer addition speed increases the speed of 2D COF crystal growth. The insights provided by this model led us to rapidly synthesize large COF&#8208;5 colloids, which was previously achieved with prolonged reaction times or by introducing chemical modulators.







Abstract
Rapidly synthesizing high&#8208;quality two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) is crucial for their practical applications. While strategies such as slow monomer addition have been developed based on an empirical understanding of their formation process, quantitative guidance remains absent, which prohibits precise optimizations of the experimental conditions. Here, we use a machine&#8208;learning approach that overcomes the challenges associated with bottom&#8208;up model derivation for the non&#8208;classical 2D COF crystallization processes. The resulting model, referred to as NEgen1, establishes correlations among the induction time, nucleation rate, growth rate, bond&#8208;forming rate constants, and common solution synthesis conditions for 2D COFs that grow by a nucleation&#8208;elongation mechanism. The results elucidate the detailed competition between the nucleation and growth dynamics in solution, which has been inappropriately described previously by classical, empirical models with assumptions invalid for 2D COF polymerization. By understanding the dynamic processes at play, the NEgen1 model reveals a simple strategy of gradually increasing monomer addition speed for growing large 2D COF crystals. This insight enables us to rapidly synthesize large COF&#8208;5 colloids, which could only be achieved previously by prolonged reaction times or by introducing chemical modulators. These results highlight the potential for systematically improving the crystal quality of 2D COFs, which has wide&#8208;reaching relevance for many of the applications where 2D COFs are speculated to be valuable.

         <title>Switching Product Selectivity in CO2 Electroreduction via Cu&#8722;S Bond Length Variation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching product selectivity in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is achieved by precisely controlling the Cu&#8722;S bond length. By introducing a S&#8722;Sb covalent bond adjacent to the Cu&#8722;S ionic bond with S atom as a bridge, the Cu&#8722;S bond length is elongated, which affects the adsorption strength and characteristics of key intermediates, and further regulates the reaction pathway, thus driving the CO2RR primary product to switch from HCOOH to CO.







Abstract
Regulating competitive reaction pathways to direct the selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction toward a desired product is crucial but remains challenging. Herein, switching product from HCOOH to CO is achieved by incorporating Sb element into the CuS, in which the Cu&#8722;S ionic bond is coupled with S&#8722;Sb covalent bond through bridging S atoms that elongates the Cu&#8722;S bond from 2.24&#8197;&#197; to 2.30&#8197;&#197;. Consequently, CuS with a shorter Cu&#8722;S bond exhibited a high selectivity for producing HCOOH, with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 72&#8201;%. Conversely, Cu3SbS4 characterized by an elongated Cu&#8722;S bond exhibited the most pronounced production of CO with a maximum FE of 60&#8201;%. In situ spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations revealed that the altered Cu&#8722;S bond length and local coordination environment make the *HCOO binding energy weaker on Cu3SbS4 compared to that on CuS. Notably, a volcano&#8208;shaped correlation between the Cu&#8722;S bond length and adsorption strength of *COOH indicates that Cu&#8722;S in Cu3SbS4 as double&#8208;active sites facilitates the adsorption of *COOH, and thus results in the high selectivity of Cu3SbS4 toward CO.

         <title>Highly Stable Carboranyl Ligated Gold Nano&#8208;Catalysts for Regioselective Aromatic Bromination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboranes are disclosed to generate highly stable CB@AuNPs of core&#8208;satellite structures. They are capable of suppressing active species dissolution under harsh conditions and have realized regioselective bromination of unbiased arenes with p&#8201;:&#8201;o selectivities comparable if not superior to those in the best selective non&#8208;enzyme catalytic systems.







Abstract
Achieving electronic/steric control and realizing selectivity regulation in nanocatalysis remains a formidable challenge, as the dynamic nature of metal&#8208;ligand interfaces, including dissolution (metal leaching) and structural reconstruction, poses significant obstacles. Herein, we disclose carboranyls (CBs) as unprecedented carbon&#8208;bonded functional ligands (Eads.CB&#8208;Au(111)=&#8722;2.90&#8197;eV) for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), showcasing their exceptional stabilization capability that is attributed by strong Au&#8722;C bonds combined with B&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au interactions. The synthesized CB@AuNPs exhibit core(Aun)&#8208;satellite(CB2Au&#8722;) structure, showing high stability towards multiple stimuli (110&#8201;&#176;C, pH=1&#8211;12, thiol etchants). In addition, different from conventional AuNP catalysts such as triphenylphosphine (PPh3) stabilized AuNPs, dissolution of catalytically active gold species was suppressed in CB@AuNPs under the reaction conditions. Leveraging these distinct features, CB@AuNPs realized outstanding p&#8201;:&#8201;o selectivities in aromatic bromination. Unbiased arenes including chlorobenzene (up to &gt;30&#8201;:&#8201;1), bromobenzene (15&#8201;:&#8201;1) and phenyl acrylate were examined using CB@AuNPs as catalysts to afford highly&#8208;selective p&#8208;products. Both carboranyl ligands and carboranyl derived counterions are crucial for such regioselective transformation. This work has provided valuable insights for AuNPs in realizing diverse regioselective transformations.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Solar Transformation of Sugars via a Heterogenous Gallium(III) Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>

A heterogeneous gallium(III) catalyst drives the sugar transformation reaction by visible light with turnover numbers (TONs) as high as 1500, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the TON of the homogeneous gallium(III) catalyst.







Abstract
Extremely limited research exploring the photocatalytic potential of main group metals, such as aluminum, gallium, and tin, has been undertaken due to their weak light harvesting properties. This study reports the efficient transformation of sugars to 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with high yield employing an original heterogeneous photocatalyst comprising a gallium(III) complex immobilized on an alumina support. Under visible light irradiation, the reaction rate of HMF formation is ~143&#8197;times higher than the equivalent thermal reaction performed in the absence of light. The turnover number (TON) of the heterogeneous gallium(III) photocatalyst was as high as 1500, which was ca. two orders of magnitude higher than the TON of the homogeneous gallium(III) system. It is proposed that photoirradiation significantly enhances the Lewis acidity of the catalyst by forming a semi&#8208;coordination state between gallium(III) and N&#8208;donor ligands, enabling the increased interaction of reactant sugar molecules with gallium(III) active sites. Consistent with this, the photoresponsive coordination of the gallium(III) complex and the abstraction of the hydroxy group by the metal under irradiation with visible light is observed by NMR spectroscopy for the first time. These findings demonstrate that efficient photocatalysts derived from the main group elements can facilitate biomass conversion using visible light.

         <title>Cationic Bis(hydrosilane)&#8212;Coinage&#8208;Metal Complexes: Synthesis, Characterization, and Use as Catalysts for Outer&#8208;Sphere C=O Hydrosilylation Not Involving Metal Hydrides</title>

Coinage&#8208;metal hydrides or Lewis acidic cationic hydrosilane&#8211;coinage&#8208;metal complexes? The synthesis and characterization of cationic bis(hydrosilane)&#8211;coinage&#8208;metal complexes are reported. These can catalyze carbonyl hydrosilylation without the addition of an external base. Mechanistic control experiments and DFT calculations reveal a new mechanism in which the coinage&#8208;metal&#8211;alkoxides act as the key intermediates.







Abstract
The preparation of cationic bis(hydrosilane)&#8211;coinage&#8208;metal complexes by chloride abstraction from the neutral metal chloride precursors with Na[BArF4] is described. Unlike previously reported hydrosilane&#8208;stabilized copper and silver complexes, the presented complexes are cationic and feature two bidentate (ortho&#8208;silylphenyl)phosphine ligands. These complexes were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, revealing that both Si&#8722;H bonds are activated by the Lewis acidic cationic metal center. The new complexes were found to be effective in catalytic carbonyl hydrosilylation, leading to the corresponding silyl ethers under mild conditions without the addition of an external base. Combined mechanistic control experiments and quantum chemical calculations support an ionic outer&#8208;sphere mechanism, in which a neutral metal alkoxide species instead of a metal hydride is the key intermediate that interacts with the silylcarboxonium ion to generate the silyl ether.

         <dc:description>
A series of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven multicomponent reactions of amines, carbon disulfide, and olefins for the mild and versatile synthesis of linear thioamides and cyclic thiolactams are presented. The use of inexpensive and readily available carbon disulfide as the thiocarbonyl source in a radical pathway enables the facile assembly of structurally diverse amine moieties with non&#8208;nucleophilic carbon&#8208;based reaction partners.







Abstract
Thioamides are widely used structures in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, as well as important synthons for the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycles. This report presents a series of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven multicomponent reactions of amines, carbon disulfide, and olefins for the mild and versatile synthesis of linear thioamides and cyclic thiolactams. The use of inexpensive and readily available carbon disulfide as the thiocarbonyl source in a radical pathway enables the facile assembly of structurally diverse amine moieties with non&#8208;nucleophilic carbon&#8208;based reaction partners. Radical thiocarbamoylative cyclization provides a practical protocol that complements traditional approaches to thiolactams relying on deoxythionation. Mechanistic studies reveal that direct photoexcitation of in situ formed dithiocarbamate anions as well as versatile photoinduced electron transfer with diverse electron acceptors are key to the reactions.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Transition Metal Coordinated Polymers for Active and Stable Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal anodic oxidation&#8208;electrodeposition strategy is developed for firmly growing a variety of transition metal&#8208;coordinated polymer catalysts on diverse substrates. An exemplified NiFe&#8208;polypyrrole (NiFe&#8208;PPy) with Ni/Fe&#8722;N4 coordination structure transforms into a mosaic structure with NiFe (oxy)hydroxides embedded in PPy matrix during oxygen evolution, which exhibits remarkable activity and stability in alkaline seawater due to the electronic structure modulation, metal anchoring effect and strong substrate adhesion.







Abstract
Transition metal coordination polymers (TM&#8208;CP) are promising inexpensive and flexible electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction in water electrolysis, while their facile synthesis and controllable regulation remain challenging. Here we report an anodic oxidation&#8208;electrodeposition strategy for the growth of TM&#8208;CP (TM=Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, Mn; CP=polyaniline, polypyrrole) films on a variety of metal substrates that act as both catalyst supports and metal ion sources. An exemplified bimetallic NiFe&#8208;polypyrrole (NiFe&#8208;PPy) features superior mechanical stability in friction and exhibits high activity with long&#8208;term durability in alkaline seawater (over 2000&#8197;h) and anion exchange membrane electrolyzer devices at current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Spectroscopic and microscopic analysis unravels the configurations with atomically distributed metal sites induced by d&#8208;&#960; conjugation, which transforms into a mosaic structure with NiFe (oxy)hydroxides embedded in PPy matrix during oxygen evolution. The superior catalytic performance is ascribed to the anchoring effect of PPy that inhibits metal dissolution, the strong substrate&#8208;to&#8208;catalyst interaction that ensures good adhesion, and the Fe/Ni&#8722;N coordination that modulates the electronic structures to facilitate the deprotonation of *OOH intermediate. This work provides a general strategy and mechanistic insight into building robust inorganic/polymer composite electrodes for oxygen electrocatalysis.

         <title>Highly Efficient Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia through the Cooperation of Plasma and Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Reactors with Confined Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>

A highly efficient and tunable ammonia synthesis from N2 and H2O is presented, where the plasma activates inert N2 molecules into the excited nitrogen species reacting with the confined H2O molecules in porous MOF reactors with various compositions and structures.







Abstract
While the ambient N2 reduction to ammonia (NH3) using H2O as hydrogen source (2N2+6H2O=4NH3+3O2) is known as a promising alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process, the high bond energy of N&#8801;N bond leads to the extremely low NH3 yield. Herein, we report a highly efficient catalytic system for ammonia synthesis using the low&#8208;temperature dielectric barrier discharge plasma to activate inert N2 molecules into the excited nitrogen species, which can efficiently react with the confined and concentrated H2O molecules in porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) reactors with V3+, Cr3+, Mn3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ ions. Specially, the Fe&#8208;based catalyst MIL&#8208;100(Fe) causes a superhigh NH3 yield of 22.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The investigation of catalytic performance and systematic characterizations of MIL&#8208;100(Fe) during the plasma&#8208;driven catalytic reaction unveils that the in situ generated defective Fe&#8722;O clusters are the highly active sites and NH3 molecules indeed form inside the MIL&#8208;100(Fe) reactor. The theoretical calculation reveals that the porous MOF catalysts have different adsorption capacity for nitrogen species on different catalytic metal sites, where the optimal MIL&#8208;100(Fe) has the lowest energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting *NNH formation step, significantly enhancing efficiency of nitrogen fixation.

         <title>Multiple Chirality Switching of a Dye&#8208;Grafted Helical Polymer Film Driven by Acid &amp; Base</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polymer film with unique multiple chirality inversion properties has been efficiently prepared, based on a newly&#8208;designed pH&#8208;sensitive dye&#8208;grafted helical polymer. Benefited from the cooperative effects of various weak interactions (hydrogen bonds, etc) under the aggregated state, this polymer film exhibited a promising acid &amp; base&#8208;driven multiple chirality inversion property containing record five switchable chiral states and good reversibility.







Abstract
A stimuli&#8208;responsive multiple chirality switching material, which can regulate opposed chiral absorption characteristics, has great application value in the fields of optical modulation, information storage and encryption, etc. However, due to the rareness of effective functional systems and the complexity of material structures, developing this type of material remains an insurmountable challenge. Herein, a smart polymer film with multiple chirality inversion properties was fabricated efficiently based on a newly&#8208;designed acid &amp; base&#8208;sensitive dye&#8208;grafted helical polymer. Benefited from the cooperative effects of various weak interactions (hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interaction, etc.) under the aggregated state, this polymer film exhibited a promising acid &amp; base&#8208;driven multiple chirality inversion property containing record switchable chiral states (up to five while the solution showed three&#8208;state switching) and good reversibility. The creative exploration of such a multiple chirality switching material can not only promote the application progress of current chiroptical regulation technology, but also provide a significant guidance for the design and synthesis of future smart chiroptical switching materials and devices.

         <title>Molecular Engineering Regulation Achieving Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Polarization in Rare&#8208;Earth Hybrid Double Perovskites for Ferroelectrics and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>

F&#8208;substitution achieves out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and multipolar axis multiferroicity and enhances the Tc 94&#8197;K in rare&#8208;earth hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric with CPL response. It reveals that F&#8208;substitution is a powerful approach to controlling the performances of ferroic materials and providing new prospects for applications in next&#8208;generation ferroelectric micro&#8208;nano devices.







Abstract
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization is a highly desired property of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics for application in vertical sandwich&#8208;type photoferroelectric devices, especially in ultrathin ferroelectronic devices. Nevertheless, despite great advances that have been made in recent years, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization remains unrealized in the 2D hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric family. Here, from our previous work 2D hybrid double perovskite HQERN ((S3HQ)4EuRb(NO3)8, S3HQ=S&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxylquinuclidinium), we designed a molecular strategy of F&#8208;substitution on organic component to successfully obtain FQERN ((S3FQ)4EuRb(NO3)8, S3FQ=S&#8208;3&#8208;fluoroquinuclidinium) showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) response. Remarkably, compared to the monopolar axis ferroelectric HQERN, FQERN not only shows multiferroicity with the coexistence of multipolar axis ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity but also realizes out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric polarization and a dramatic enhancement of Curie temperature of 94&#8197;K. This is mainly due to the introduction of F&#8208;substituted organic cations, which leads to a change in orientation and a reduction in crystal lattice void occupancy. Our study demonstrates that F&#8208;substitution is an efficient strategy to realize and optimize ferroelectric functional characteristics, giving more possibility of 2D ferroelectric materials for applications in micro&#8208;nano optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;F-substitution achieves out-of-plane and multipolar axis multiferroicity and enhances the &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; 94&#8197;K in rare-earth hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric with CPL response. It reveals that F-substitution is a powerful approach to controlling the performances of ferroic materials and providing new prospects for applications in next-generation ferroelectric micro-nano devices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out-of-plane polarization is a highly desired property of two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics for application in vertical sandwich-type photoferroelectric devices, especially in ultrathin ferroelectronic devices. Nevertheless, despite great advances that have been made in recent years, out-of-plane polarization remains unrealized in the 2D hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric family. Here, from our previous work 2D hybrid double perovskite HQERN ((S3HQ)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;EuRb(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, S3HQ=S-3-hydroxylquinuclidinium), we designed a molecular strategy of F-substitution on organic component to successfully obtain FQERN ((S3FQ)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;EuRb(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, S3FQ=S-3-fluoroquinuclidinium) showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) response. Remarkably, compared to the monopolar axis ferroelectric HQERN, FQERN not only shows multiferroicity with the coexistence of multipolar axis ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity but also realizes out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization and a dramatic enhancement of Curie temperature of 94&#8197;K. This is mainly due to the introduction of F-substituted organic cations, which leads to a change in orientation and a reduction in crystal lattice void occupancy. Our study demonstrates that F-substitution is an efficient strategy to realize and optimize ferroelectric functional characteristics, giving more possibility of 2D ferroelectric materials for applications in micro-nano optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Steric Hindrance Engineering to Modulate the Closed Pores Formation of Polymer&#8208;Derived Hard Carbon for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A steric hindrance strategy has been proposed to modulate the closed pores formation of polymer&#8208;derived hard carbon (HC). Sterically hindered groups with aromatic ring are crucial to enhance the rigidity and internal free volumes of polymer, which could suppress the polymer rearrangements and induce the formation of close pores. Moreover, the fabricated HC anode exhibit excellent Na+ storage capacity and fast Na+ transport for sodium&#8208;ion battery.







Abstract
The closed pores play a critical role in improving the sodium storage capacity of hard carbon (HC) anode, however, their formation mechanism as well as the efficient modulation strategy at molecular level in the polymer&#8208;derived HCs is still lacking. In this work, the steric hindrance effect has been proposed to create closed pores in the polymer&#8208;derived HCs for the first time through grafting the aromatic rings within and between the main chains in the precursor. The experimental data and theoretical calculation demonstrate that steric&#8208;hindrance effect from the aromatic ring side group can increase backbone rigidity and the internal free volumes in the polymer precursor, which can prevent the over graphitization and facilitate the formation of closed pores during the carbonization process. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared HC anode exhibits a remarkably enhanced discharge capacity of 340.3&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;C, improved rate performance (210.7&#8197;mAh/g at 5&#8197;C) as well as boosted cycling stability (86.4&#8201;% over 1000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C). This work provides a new insight into the formation mechanisms of closed pores via steric hindrance engineering, which can shed light on the development of high&#8208;performance polymer&#8208;derived HC anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A Rechargeable &#8220;Rocking Chair&#8221; Type Zn&#8722;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a &#8220;rocking chair&#8221; type aqueous Zn&#8722;CO2 battery was designed with Zn2+ cations shuttling between the cathode and anode in a single compartment. A weak&#8208;acidic zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (ZnOTf)2 aqueous electrolyte was introduced to inhibit interfacial side reactions on the Zn anode and facilitate uniform Zn plating. Experimental results confirm a novel reaction pathway of the reversible formation and decomposition for ZnCO3 and carbon discharge products.







Abstract
Rising global temperatures and critical energy shortages have spurred researches into CO2 fixation and conversion within the realm of energy storage such as Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries. However, traditional Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries employ double&#8208;compartment electrolytic cells with separate carriers for catholytes and anolytes, diverging from the &#8220;rocking chair&#8221; battery mechanism. The specific energy of these conventional batteries is constrained by the solubility of discharge reactants/products in the electrolyte. Additionally, H2O molecules tend to trigger parasitic reactions at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces, undermining the long&#8208;term stability of Zn anodes. In this report, we introduce an innovative &#8220;rocking chair&#8221; type Zn&#8722;CO2 battery that utilizes a weak&#8208;acidic zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate aqueous electrolyte compatible with both cathode and anode. This design minimizes side reactions on the Zn surface and leverages the high catalytic activity of the cathode material, allowing the battery to achieve a substantial discharge capacity of 6734&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintain performance over 65&#8197;cycles. Moreover, the successful production of pouch cells demonstrates the practical applicability of Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries. Electrode characterizations confirm superior electrochemical reversibility, facilitated by solid discharge products of ZnCO3 and C. This work advances a &#8220;rocking chair&#8221; Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with an enhanced specific energy and a reversible pathway, providing a foundation for developing high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Atomic Level&#8208;Macroscopic Structure&#8208;Activity of Inhomogeneous Localized Aggregates Enabled Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature Hybrid Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel micelle&#8208;like structure electrolyte in macroscopic activity is proposed, featuring organic&#8208;enriched phases and nanosized aqueous electrolyte aggregates. Enabled by low donor number co&#8208;solvents and amphiphilic anions, this electrolyte offers exceptional solubility, wide electrochemical window, low viscosity, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultra&#8208;low temperature (&#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C) zinc ion conductivity in aqueous batteries.







Abstract
The utilization of hybrid aqueous electrolytes has significantly broadened the electrochemical and temperature ranges of aqueous batteries, such as aqueous zinc and lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but the design principles for extreme operating conditions remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically unveil the ternary interaction involving salt&#8208;water&#8208;organic co&#8208;solvents and its intricate impacts on both the atomic&#8208;level and macroscopic structural features of the hybrid electrolytes. This highlights a distinct category of micelle&#8208;like structure electrolytes featuring organic&#8208;enriched phases and nanosized aqueous electrolyte aggregates, enabled by appropriate low donor number co&#8208;solvents and amphiphilic anions. Remarkably, the electrolyte enables exceptional high solubility, accommodating up to 29.8&#8197;m zinc triflate within aqueous micelles. This configuration maintains an intra&#8208;micellar salt&#8208;in&#8208;water setup, allowing for a broad electrochemical window (up to 3.86&#8197;V), low viscosity, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultralow&#8208;temperature zinc ion conductivity (1.58&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C). Building upon the unique nature of the inhomogeneous localized aggregates, this micelle&#8208;like electrolyte facilitates dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping, even at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C. The assembled Zn||PANI battery showcases an impressive capacity of 71.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an extended lifespan of over 3000 cycles at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C. This study opens up a promising approach in electrolyte design that transcends conventional local atomic solvation structures, broadening the water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolyte concept.

Crystalline supramolecular polymer frameworks (SPFs) with controlled pore structure and tunable aperture are readily prepared using three&#8208;arm rigid polyisocyanides as building block via intermolecular hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Porous frameworks with controlled pore structure and tunable aperture are greatly demanded. However, precise synthesis of this kind of materials is a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the fabrication of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular polymer frameworks using a precisely synthesized rod&#8208;like helical polyisocyanide as link. Four three&#8208;arm star&#8208;shaped polyisocyanides with the degree of the polymerization of 10, 20, 30 and 40, and having 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4[1H]&#8208;pyrimidinone (UPy) terminals were synthesized. 2D&#8208;Crystalline polymer frameworks with apertures of 5.3, 10.1, 13.9, and 19.1&#8197;nm were respectively obtained through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction between the terminal Upy units. The pore aperture is dependent on the length of polyisocyanide backbone. Thus, well&#8208;defined supramolecular polymer frameworks with controlled and uniform hexagonal pores were obtained, as proved by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (synchrotron radiation facility), atomic force microscopy, and Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller analyses. The frameworks with uniform large pore aperture were used to purify nanomaterials and immobilize biomacromolecules. For instance, the membranes of the polymer frameworks could size&#8208;fractionation of silver nanoparticles into uniform nanoparticles with very low dispersity. The frameworks with large aperture facilitated the inclusion of myoglobin and enhanced the stability and catalytic activity.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Group Polymer Coating on Zn Anode for High Overall Conversion Efficiency Photorechargeable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Poly(diethynylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triimine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trione) was developed as a functional polymer coating for Zn, enhancing the cycling stability of the Zn anode and accelerating the storage rate of photogenerated charges. This enabled the fabricated photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries to achieve a high overall conversion efficiency of 13.12&#8201;%.







Abstract
The solar&#8208;driven photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries have emerged as a promising power solution for smart electronic devices and equipment. However, the subpar cyclic stability of the Zn anode remains a significant impediment to their practical application. Herein, poly(diethynylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triimine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trione) (PDPTT) was designed as a functional polymer coating of Zn. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the PDPTT coating not only significantly homogenizes the electric field distribution on the Zn surface, but also promotes the ion&#8208;accessible surface of Zn. With multiple N and C=O groups exhibiting strong adsorption energies, this polymer coating reduces the nucleation overpotential of Zn, alters the diffusion pathway of Zn2+ at the anode interface, and decreases the corrosion current and hydrogen evolution current. Leveraging these advantages, Zn&#8208;PDPTT//Zn&#8208;PDPTT exhibits an exceptionally long cycling time (&#8805;4300&#8197;h, 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Zn&#8208;PDPTT//AC zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors can withstand 50,000 cycles at 5&#8197;A/g. Zn&#8208;PDPTT//NVO zinc&#8208;ion battery exhibits a faster charge storage rate, higher capacity, and excellent cycling stability. Coupling Zn&#8208;PDPTT//NVO with high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells results in a 13.12&#8201;% overall conversion efficiency for the photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion battery, showcasing significant value in advancing the efficiency and upgrading conversion of renewable energy utilization.

         <title>Crystalline Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Coatings Engineered via Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;phenolic network interfacial strategy is developed to form crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) on diverse particle and planar substrates. This strategy allows for customized physicochemical properties (e.g., thickness, and morphology) of the supported crystalline MOFs, with potential for biomedical, agricultural, and energy applications.







Abstract
Crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered extensive attention owing to their highly ordered porous structure and physicochemical properties. However, their practical application often requires their integration with various substrates, which is challenging because of their weakly adhesive nature and the diversity of substrates that exhibit different properties. Herein, we report the use of amorphous metal&#8211;phenolic network coatings to facilitate the growth of crystalline MOF coatings on various particle and planar substrates. Crystalline MOFs with different metal ions and morphologies were successfully deposited on substrates (13 types) of varying sizes, shapes, and surface chemistries. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of the coated crystalline MOFs (e.g., composition, thickness) could be tuned using different synthesis conditions. The engineered MOF&#8208;coated membranes demonstrated excellent liquid and gas separation performance, exhibiting a high H2 permeance of 63200&#8197;GPU and a H2/CH4 selectivity of 10.19, likely attributable to the thin nature of the coating (~180&#8197;nm). Considering the vast array of MOFs available (&gt;90,000) and the diversity of substrates, this work is expected to pave the way for creating a wide range of MOF composites and coatings with potential applications in diverse fields.

         <title>Formal High&#8208;Order Cycloadditions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Cycloheptatrienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of formal high&#8208;order [6+n]&#8208;cycloaddition and annulation processes of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with cycloheptatriene systems has been designed. The reactivity of methylated cycloheptatrienes from Me1 to Me5 as well as unsubstituted cycloheptatriene was studied in detail under GaCl3 activation conditions, enabling the efficient generation of gallium 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates.







Abstract
The design of various cycloaddition/annulation processes is one of the most intriguing challenges in the development of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropane chemistry. In this work, a new class of formal high&#8208;order [6+n]&#8208;cycloaddition and annulation processes of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes with cycloheptatriene systems has been designed and reported, to fill a significant gap in the chemistry of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes. The reactivity of methylated cycloheptatrienes from Me1 to Me5 as well as unsubstituted cycloheptatriene was studied in detail under GaCl3 activation conditions, which makes it possible to efficiently generate gallium 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic complexes or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates starting from D&#8211;A cyclopropanes, while other Lewis acids are ineffective and non&#8208;selective. New examples of formal [6+2]&#8208;, [6+3]&#8208;, [6+4]&#8208;, [6+1]&#8208;, and [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition and annulation reactions with cycloheptatrienes along with more complex processes were discovered. Cycloheptatriene itself can also successfully act as a hydride anion donor, which allows the ionic hydrogenation of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes to be performed under mild conditions. As a result, a number of efficient and highly diastereoselective protocols for the synthesis of seven&#8208;membered carbocycles has been developed.

         <title>A Hexaarylbiimidazole&#8208;Terarylene Hybrid: Visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR&#8208;II Absorption via Sequential Photochromic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photochromic molecule that consists of HABI and terarylene exhibits the sequential four&#8208;state photochromism. The delocalization of a &#960;&#8208;electron spin on the 6&#960;&#8208;electron system of the terarylene unit is crucially efficient in increasing the photosensitivity to NIR&#8208;II light. A recombination reaction of radicals between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers of terarylene affords an unprecedented photochromic dimer.







Abstract
A synergetic interaction between two or more photochromic chromophores has a potential to achieve advanced photochemical properties beyond conventional photochromic molecules and to realize photochemical control of complex systems using only a single molecule. Herein, we report a hybrid photochromic molecule consisting of hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) and terarylene that exhibits multi&#8208;state photochromism. The biphotochrome hybrid shows four&#8208;state photochromic reaction involving sequentially proceeding photoreactions. The UV or visible light irradiation to the biphotochrome leads to the C&#8722;N bond breaking reaction of the HABI in preference to the ring&#8208;closing reaction of the 6&#960;&#8208;electron system in the terarylene unit, leading to two terarylene radical molecules.

&lt;p&gt;A hybrid photochromic molecule that consists of HABI and terarylene exhibits the sequential four-state photochromism. The delocalization of a &#960;-electron spin on the 6&#960;-electron system of the terarylene unit is crucially efficient in increasing the photosensitivity to NIR-II light. A recombination reaction of radicals between the open- and closed-ring isomers of terarylene affords an unprecedented photochromic dimer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A synergetic interaction between two or more photochromic chromophores has a potential to achieve advanced photochemical properties beyond conventional photochromic molecules and to realize photochemical control of complex systems using only a single molecule. Herein, we report a hybrid photochromic molecule consisting of hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) and terarylene that exhibits multi-state photochromism. The biphotochrome hybrid shows four-state photochromic reaction involving sequentially proceeding photoreactions. The UV or visible light irradiation to the biphotochrome leads to the C&#8722;N bond breaking reaction of the HABI in preference to the ring-closing reaction of the 6&#960;-electron system in the terarylene unit, leading to two terarylene radical molecules. The photogenerated terarylene radical further exhibits the 6&#960;-electrocyclization reaction by UV irradiation. The delocalized &#960;-radical on the closed-ring form of the terarylene is efficient to enhance the photosensitivity to the NIR&#8722;I and -II region. Furthermore, a recombination reaction of radicals between the open- and closed-ring isomers of terarylene affords an unprecedented photochromic dimer as a structural isomer of the initial molecule. This is a consequence of the sequential hybrid photochromic system involving the HABI and terarylene units.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fe&#8722;O4 Motif Activated Graphitic Carbon via Oxo&#8208;Bridge for Highly Selective H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>

The Fe&#8722;O4 motif embedded carbon material catalyzes oxygen reduction reaction via two electron pathway (2e ORR) to achieve a record&#8208;high H2O2 production rate of 33.5&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in alkaline electrolyte with exceptional selectivity at a high current density, thanks to the carbon reaction sites activated by the well&#8208;defined Fe&#8722;O4 motif via oxo&#8208;bridges and the highly graphitized carbon substrate.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based materials have been utilized as effective catalysts for hydrogen peroxide electrosynthesis via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e ORR), however the insufficient selectivity and productivity still hindered the further industrial applications. In this work, we report the Fe&#8722;O4 motif activated graphitic carbon material which enabled highly selective H2O2 electrosynthesis operating at high current density with excellent anti&#8208;poisoning property. In the bulk production test, the concentration of H2O2 cumulated to 8.6&#8201;% in 24&#8197;h and the corresponding production rate of 33.5&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 outperformed all previously reported materials. Theoretical model backed by in situ characterization verified &#945;&#8208;C surrounding the Fe&#8722;O4 motif as the actual reaction site in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics aspects. The strategy of activating carbon reaction site by metal center via oxo&#8208;bridge provides inspiring insights for the rational design of carbon materials for heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Mediated Supramolecular Heterodimerisation and Photoinduced [2+2] Heterocycloaddition to Generate Unexpected [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An arene&#8208;fluoroarene strategy has been used to affect a simple cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated supramolecular heterodimerisation. A further photoinduced [2+2] heterocycloaddition leads to the formation of an unexpected [2]rotaxane.







Abstract
In contrast to the self&#8208;assembly of homosupramolecules, the self&#8208;assembly of heterosupramolecules is more challenging and significant in various fields. Herein, we design and investigate a cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated heterodimerisation based on an arene&#8208;fluoroarene strategy. Furthermore, the heteroternary complex is found to be able to undergo a photoinduced [2+2] heterocycloaddition, resulting in the formation of an unexpected [2]rotaxane. This work demonstrates a novel supramolecular heterodimerisation system that not only contributes to the development of photoisomerisation systems, but also enriches synthetic methods for mechanically interlocked molecules.

         <title>Switching Reaction Pathways of CO2 Electroreduction by Modulating Cations in the Electrochemical Double Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved tunable reaction pathways for CO2 electroreduction by adjusting the cations in the electrochemical double layer. The main product could be switched from CO (Faradaic efficiency of 97.3&#8201;%) to formate (Faradaic efficiency of 93.5&#8201;%) by simply changing the alkali metal cations in the ternary ionic liquid&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte.







Abstract
Tuning the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) solely by changing electrolyte is a very attractive topic. In this study, we conducted CO2RR in different aqueous electrolytes over bulk metal electrodes. It was discovered that controlled CO2RR could be achieved by modulating cations in the electrochemical double layer. Specifically, ionic liquid cations in the electrolyte significantly inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while yielding high Faraday efficiencies toward CO (FECO) or formate (FEformate) depending on the alkali metal cations. For example, the product could be switched from CO (FECO=97.3&#8201;%) to formate (FEformate=93.5&#8201;%) by changing the electrolyte from 0.1&#8197;M KBr&#8208;0.5&#8197;M 1&#8208;octyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bromide (OmimBr) to 0.1&#8197;M CsBr&#8208;0.5&#8197;M OmimBr aqueous solutions over pristine Cu foil electrode. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the ordered structure generated by the assembly of Omim+ under an applied negative potential alters the hydrogen bonding structure of the interfacial water, thereby inhibiting the HER. The difference in selectivity in the presence of different cations is attributed to the hydrogen bonding effect caused by Omim+, which alters the solvated structure of the alkali metal cations and thus affects the stabilization of intermediates of different pathways.

         <title>Vacancies&#8208;regulated Prussian Blue Analogues through Precipitation Conversion for Cathodes in Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries with Energy Densities over 500&#8197;Wh/kg</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
[Fe(CN)6] vacancies regulation is proposed to achieve high specific capacity of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). And then a novel precipitation conversion synthesis method was designed. The as&#8208;prepared PBAs with hierarchical hollow morphology and [Fe(CN)6] vacancies have reached a unprecedent level of high capacity, superior rate performance, and ultrahigh energy density.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely applied in many fields, especially as cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries on account of their low cost and open framework for fast ions transport. However, the capacity of reported PBAs has a great distance from its theoretical value. Herein, we proposed that [Fe(CN)6] vacancies are crucial point for the high specific capacity for the first time. The [Fe(CN)6] vacancies may create net electrons and reduce obstacles to ionic transport, which is conducive to rate performance of PBAs by increasing electronic and ionic conductivity to some extent. As a proof of concept, a series of PBAs have been prepared by co&#8208;precipitation method. And then, a novel precipitation conversion method has been designed, by which unique PBAs with a specific quantity of [Fe(CN)6] vacancies was successfully synthesized. Remarkably, the as&#8208;prepared PBAs possessing hierarchical hollow morphology have reached a unprecedent level of high capacity (168&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 25&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, close to PBAs&#8217; theoretical capacity 170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), high rate performance (90&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and high energy density (over 500&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1).

The [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] vacancies may create net electrons and reduce obstacles to ionic transport, which is conducive to rate performance of PBAs by increasing electronic and ionic conductivity to some extent. As a proof of concept, a series of PBAs have been prepared by co-precipitation method. And then, a novel precipitation conversion method has been designed, by which unique PBAs with a specific quantity of [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] vacancies was successfully synthesized. Remarkably, the as-prepared PBAs possessing hierarchical hollow morphology have reached a unprecedent level of high capacity (168&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, close to PBAs&#8217; theoretical capacity 170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), high rate performance (90&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and high energy density (over 500&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A photoinduced and electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component C(sp3)&#8722;H bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP)&#8208;arylation of glycine derivatives was developed. This protocol demonstrated efficacy in synthesizing diverse unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids incorporating 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP motifs and enabled the late&#8208;stage integration of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCPs into peptides, applicable to both liquid&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase reactions.







Abstract
The photoredox electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex&#8208;mediated radical coupling reaction has gained prominence in the field of organic synthesis, finding widespread application in two&#8208;component coupling reactions. However, EDA complex&#8208;promoted multi&#8208;component reactions are not well developed with only a limited number of examples have been reported. Herein, we report a photoinduced and EDA complex&#8208;promoted highly chemoselective three&#8208;component radical arylalkylation of [1.1.1]propellane, which allows the direct functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H with bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP)&#8208;aryl groups under mild conditions. A variety of unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids, featuring structurally diversified 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP moieties, were synthesized in a single&#8208;step process. Notably, leveraging the high tension release of [1.1.1]propellane, the highly unstable transient aryl radical undergoes rapid conversion into a relatively stable tertiary alkyl transient radical, and consequently, the competing side&#8208;reaction of two&#8208;component coupling was entirely suppressed. The strategic use of this transient radical conversion approach would be useful for the design of diverse EDA complex&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;component reactions. It is noteworthy that the highly chemoselective late&#8208;stage incorporation of the 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP pharmacophores into peptides was achieved both in liquid&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase reactions. This advancement is anticipated to have significant application potential in the future development of peptide drugs.

         <title>Confinement of Sustainable Carbon Dots Results in Long Afterglow Emitters and Photocatalyst for Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots originating from cellulose confined in a silica matrix result in long afterglow emission indicating formation of triplet states. Their use as sensitizer in radical photopolymerization results either in free radical polymerization or controlled radical polymerization based on a photo&#8208;ATRP protocol depending on the composition. Metal&#8208;free setup indicated less uniformity while a trace of CuBr2/TPMA resulted in dispersity approaching to unity depending on concentration.







Abstract
Sustainable carbon dots based on cellulose, particularly carboxymethyl cellulose carbon dots (CMCCDs), were confined in an inorganic network resulting in CMCCDs@SiO2. This resulted in a material exhibiting long afterglow covering a time frame of several seconds also under air. Temperature&#8208;dependent emission spectra gave information on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) while photocurrent experiments provided a deeper understanding of charge availability in the dark period, and therefore, its availability on the photocatalyst surface. The photo&#8208;ATRP initiator, ethyl &#945;&#8208;bromophenylacetate (EBPA), quenched the emission from the millisecond to the nanosecond time frame indicating participation of the triplet state in photoinduced electron transfer (PET). Both free radical and controlled radical polymerization based on photo&#8208;ATRP protocol worked successfully. Metal&#8208;free photo&#8208;ATRP resulted in chain extendable macroinitiators based on a reductive mechanism with either MMA or in combination with styrene. Addition of 9&#8197;ppm Cu2+ resulted in Mw/Mn of 1.4 while an increase to 72&#8197;ppm improved uniformity of the polymers; that is Mw/Mn=1.03. Complementary experiments with kerria laca carbon dots confined materials, namely KCDs@SiO2, provided similar results. Deposition of Cu2+ (9&#8197;ppm) on the photocatalyst surface explains better uniformity of the polymers formed in the ATRP protocol.

         <title>Deciphering the Factors Controlling Hydrogen and Methyl Spillover upon Methane Dissociation on Rh/Cu(111) Single&#8208;Atom Alloy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under real&#8208;world conditions, the frequent collisions of gaseous CH4 molecules on Rh/Cu(111) single&#8208;atom alloy are a key to promote adsorbate spillover, especially for bulky polyatomic CH3* species, providing insights into the effective use of spillover in heterogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
Spillover of adsorbed species from one active site to another is a key step in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the factors controlling this step, particularly the spillover of polyatomic species, have rarely been studied. Herein, we investigate the spillover dynamics of H* and CH3* species on a single&#8208;atom alloy surface (Rh/Cu(111)) upon the dissociative chemisorption of methane (CH4), using molecular dynamics that considers both surface phonons and electron&#8208;hole pairs. These dynamical calculations are made possible by a high&#8208;dimensional potential energy surface machine learned from density functional theory data. Our results provide compelling evidence that the H* and CH3* can spill over on the metal surface at experimental temperatures and reveal novel dynamical features involving an internal motion during diffusion for CH3*. Increasing surface temperature has a minor effect on promoting spillover, as geminate recombinative desorption becomes more prevalent. However, the poisoning of the active site can be mitigated by the frequent gaseous molecular collisions that occur under ambient pressure in real&#8208;world catalysis, which transfer energy to the trapped adsorbates. Interestingly, the bulky CH3* exhibits a significant spillover advantage over the light H* due to its larger size, which facilitates energy acquisition. These insights help to advance our understanding of spillover in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Enhanced Electron Delocalization Induced by Ferromagnetic Sulfur doped C3N4 Triggers Selective H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride (S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) catalyst causes the in&#8208;plane electronic perturbations, further inducing stronger electron delocalization state on carbon sites, which breaks the *C&#8722;O bond and involves the faster desorption of the key reaction intermediate *OOH on the metal surface to form the final product H2O2.







Abstract
For the 2D metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts, the atomic coplanar architecture enables a large number of pz orbitals to overlap laterally, thus forming &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, and the delocalization degree of the central atom dominates the catalytic activity. Herein, designing sulfur&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride (S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) materials as a model, we propose a strategy to promote localized electron polarization by enhancing the ferromagnetism of ultra&#8208;thin 2D carbon nitride nanosheets. The introduction of sulfur (S) further promotes localized ferromagnetic coupling, thereby inducing long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering and accelerating the electron interface transport. Meanwhile, the hybridization of sulfur atoms breaks the symmetry and integrity of the unit structure, promotes electron enrichment and stimulating electron delocalization at the active site. This optimization enhances the *OOH desorption, providing a favorable kinetic pathway for the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Consequently, S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4 exhibits high selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%) and achieves a superb H2O2 production rate, approaching 4374.8&#8197;ppm during continuous electrolysis over 300&#8197;hour. According to theoretical calculation and in situ spectroscopy, the ortho&#8208;S configuration can provide ferromagnetic perturbation in carbon active centers, leading to the electron delocalization, which optimizes the OOH* adsorption during the catalytic process.

&lt;p&gt;Sulfur-doped defect-rich graphitic carbon nitride (S-Nv-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) catalyst causes the in-plane electronic perturbations, further inducing stronger electron delocalization state on carbon sites, which breaks the *C&#8722;O bond and involves the faster desorption of the key reaction intermediate *OOH on the metal surface to form the final product H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 2D metal-free carbon catalysts, the atomic coplanar architecture enables a large number of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; orbitals to overlap laterally, thus forming &#960;-electron delocalization, and the delocalization degree of the central atom dominates the catalytic activity. Herein, designing sulfur-doped defect-rich graphitic carbon nitride (S-Nv-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) materials as a model, we propose a strategy to promote localized electron polarization by enhancing the ferromagnetism of ultra-thin 2D carbon nitride nanosheets. The introduction of sulfur (S) further promotes localized ferromagnetic coupling, thereby inducing long-range ferromagnetic ordering and accelerating the electron interface transport. Meanwhile, the hybridization of sulfur atoms breaks the symmetry and integrity of the unit structure, promotes electron enrichment and stimulating electron delocalization at the active site. This optimization enhances the *OOH desorption, providing a favorable kinetic pathway for the production of hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Consequently, S-Nv-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits high selectivity (&amp;gt;95&#8201;%) and achieves a superb H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate, approaching 4374.8&#8197;ppm during continuous electrolysis over 300&#8197;hour. According to theoretical calculation and in situ spectroscopy, the ortho-S configuration can provide ferromagnetic perturbation in carbon active centers, leading to the electron delocalization, which optimizes the OOH* adsorption during the catalytic process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitrate Upcycling Mediated by Organonickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed nitrate (NO3&#8722;) upcycling technology has been developed that uses a nickel pincer complex as a bifunctional catalyst to effect sequential deoxygenation followed by C&#8722;N coupling. This approach enables nitrate salts to be selectively transformed into various oximes (&gt;20 substrates) with excellent conversion (&gt;90&#8201;%).







Abstract
Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are major environmental pollutants and to neutralize this long&#8208;term environmental threat, new catalytic methods are needed. Although there are biological denitrification processes involving four different enzymatic reactions to convert nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into dinitrogen (N2), it is unfortunately difficult to apply in industry due to the complexity of the processes. In particular, nitrate is difficult to functionalize because of its chemical stability. Thus, there is no organometallic catalysis to convert nitrate into useful chemicals. Herein, we present a nickel pincer complex that is effective as a bifunctional catalyst to stepwise deoxygenate NO3&#8722; by carbonylation and further through C&#8722;N coupling. By using this nickel catalysis, nitrate salts can be selectively transformed into various oximes (&gt;20 substrates) with excellent conversion (&gt;90&#8201;%). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the highly inert nitrate ion can be functionalized to produce useful chemicals by a new organonickel catalysis. Our results show that the NOx conversion and utilization (NCU) technology is a successful pathway for environmental restoration coupled with value&#8208;added chemical generation.

         <title>A Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Photosensitizer for Combined Pyroptosis and Apoptosis with NIR&#8208;II Imaging/Photoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z1 was synthesized and it was encapsulated with F127 polymer to obtain Z1 NPs. They could generate ROS effectively under 808&#8197;nm laser, particularly type I ROS. Moreover, they exhibited good mitochondrial targeting, and induced synergistic pyroptosis and apoptosis for potent tumor therapy. Meanwhile, Z1 NPs demonstrated NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging (NIR&#8208;II FI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI)&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy with minimal adverse effects.







Abstract
Overcoming tumor apoptosis resistance is a major challenge in enhancing cancer therapy. Pyroptosis, a lytic form of programmed cell death (PCD) involving inflammasomes, Gasdermin family proteins, and cysteine proteases, offers potential in cancer treatment. While photodynamic therapy (PDT) can induce pyroptosis by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the activation of photosensitizers (PSs), many PSs lack specific subcellular targets and are limited to the first near&#8208;infrared window, potentially reducing treatment effectiveness. Therefore, developing effective, deep&#8208;penetrating, organelle&#8208;targeted pyroptosis&#8208;mediated phototherapy is essential for cancer treatment strategies. Here, we synthesized four molecules with varying benzene ring numbers in thiopyrylium structures to preliminarily explore their photodynamic properties. The near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) PS Z1, with a higher benzene ring count, exhibited superior ROS generation and mitochondria&#8208;targeting abilities, and a large Stokes shift. Through nano&#8208;precipitation method, Z1 nanoparticles (NPs) also demonstrated high ROS generation (especially type&#8208;I ROS) upon 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation, leading to efficient mitochondria dysfunction and combined pyroptosis and apoptosis. Moreover, they exhibited exceptional tumor&#8208;targeting ability via NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging (NIR&#8208;II FI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). Furthermore, Z1 NPs&#8208;mediated phototherapy effectively inhibited tumor growth with minimal adverse effects. Our findings offer a promising strategy for cancer therapy, warranting further preclinical investigations in PDT.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Alkenes Through Hydroalkylation of Alkynyl Boronamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explored the use of a boryl group as a traceless directing group in the nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkynes. The approach allows highly selective synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes.







Abstract
Hydroalkylation of alkynes is a powerful method for alkene synthesis. However, regioselectivity has been difficult to achieve in transformations of internal alkynes hindering applications in the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes. To overcome these limitations, we explored using boryl groups as versatile directing groups that can control the regioselectivity of the hydroalkylation and subsequently be replaced in a cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The result of our exploration is a nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkynyl boronamides that provides access to a wide range of trisubstituted alkenes with high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The reaction can be accomplished with a variety of coupling partners, including primary and secondary alkyl iodides, &#945;&#8208;bromo esters, &#945;&#8208;chloro phthalimides, and &#945;&#8208;chloro boronic esters. Preliminary studies of the reaction mechanism provide evidence for the hydrometalation mechanism and the formation of alkyl radical intermediates.

         <title>Synthesis of a Metalla[2]catenane, Metallarectangles and Polynuclear Assemblies from Di(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>

The fluorenone&#8208;bridged di&#8208;NHC precursor H2&#8208;1(PF6)2 reacts with Ag2O in CH3CN to give the [2]catenane [Ag4(1)4](PF6)4, which disintegrates in DMF into two metallarectangles [Ag2(1)2](PF6)2. Substitution of the imidazo[1,5a]pyridinium NHC precursors in H2&#8208;1(PF6)2 for imidazolium groups yields di&#8208;NHC precursors H2&#8208;L(PF6)2 which react with Ag2O to yield exclusively metallarectangles of type [Ag2(L)2(PF6)2 with a spacing between the fluorenone planes too small for [2]catenane formation.







Abstract
The 2,7&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;linked bis(6&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridinium) salt H2&#8208;1(PF6)2 reacts with Ag2O in CH3CN to yield the [2]catenane [Ag4(1)4](PF6)4. The [2]catenane rearranges in DMF to yield two metallamacrocycles [Ag2(1)2](PF6)2. 2,7&#8208;Fluorenone&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;(imidazolium) salts H2&#8208;L(PF6)2 (L=2&#8201;a, 2&#8201;b) react with Ag2O in CH3CN to yield metallamacrocycles [Ag2(L)2](PF6)2 with interplanar distances between the fluorenone rings too small for [2]catenane formation. Intra&#8208; and intermolecular &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the fluorenone groups were observed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The strongly kinked 2,7&#8208;fluorenone bridged bis(5&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridinium) salt H2&#8208;4(PF6)2 reacts with Ag2O to yield [Ag2(4)(CN)](PF6), while the tetranuclear assembly [Ag4(4)2(CO3)](PF6)2 was obtained in the presence of K2CO3.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Piezoelectric Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two imine&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs), designated as CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14, were incorporated with 3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,8&#8208;tridecafluorooctyl chains to induce intrinsic polarizability and piezoelectric properties. Utilizing these two COFs to assemble piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs), remarkable output open circuit voltage, short circuit current and stability were produced under the applied force without poling conditions.







Abstract
Organic piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) are attractive in harvesting mechanical energy for various self&#8208;powering systems. However, their practical applications are severely restricted by their low output open circuit voltage. To address this issue, herein, we prepared two two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs, CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14), functionalized with fluorinated alkyl chains for PENGs. The piezoelectricity of both COFs was evidenced by switchable polarization, characteristic butterfly amplitude loops, phase hysteresis loops, conspicuous surface potentials and high piezoelectric coefficient value (d33). The PENGs fabricated with COFs displayed highest output open circuit voltages (60&#8197;V for CityU&#8208;13 and 50&#8197;V for CityU&#8208;14) and delivered satisfactory short circuit current with an excellent stability of over 600 seconds. The superior open circuit voltages of CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14 rank in top 1 and 2 among all reported organic materials&#8208;based PENGs.

         <title>Unconventional hcp/fcc Nickel Heteronanocrystal with Asymmetric Convex Sites Boosts Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular precursor&#8208;directed strategy is developed to construct unconventional Ni heteronanocrystals with multiple epitaxial hcp/fcc heterointerfaces and coherent twin boundaries, generating asymmetric surfaces with plenty of convex sites. Such unique convex sites enable the adsorption of *H in unusual bridge positions with weakened binding energy while stabilizing interfacial *H2O, synergistically facilitating alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Developing non&#8208;platinum group metal catalysts for the sluggish hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is critical for alkaline fuel cells. To date, Ni&#8208;based materials are the most promising candidates but still suffer from insufficient performance. Herein, we report an unconventional hcp/fcc Ni (u&#8208;hcp/fcc Ni) heteronanocrystal with multiple epitaxial hcp/fcc heterointerfaces and coherent twin boundaries, generating rugged surfaces with plenty of asymmetric convex sites. Systematic analyses discover that such convex sites enable the adsorption of *H in unusual bridge positions with weakened binding energy, circumventing the over&#8208;strong *H adsorption on traditional hollow positions, and simultaneously stabilizing interfacial *H2O. It thus synergistically optimizes the HOR thermodynamic process as well as reduces the kinetic barrier of the rate&#8208;determining Volmer step. Consequently, the developed u&#8208;hcp/fcc Ni exhibits the top&#8208;rank alkaline HOR activity with a mass activity of 40.6&#8197;mA&#8201;mgNi&#8722;1 (6.3&#8197;times higher than fcc Ni control) together with superior stability and high CO&#8208;tolerance. These results provide a paradigm for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts by shifting the adsorption state of intermediates through configuring surface sites.

         <dc:description>
A methodology that involves anionic chemistry of carbonate anions to tailor the electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction reactions of bismuth (Bi) electrodes is presented, where the conversion energy barrier for Bi (0) to Bi (III) has been significantly reduced, endowing anionic full batteries with enhanced electrochemical kinetics and chemical self&#8208;charging property.







Abstract
Anionic chemistry modulation represents a promising avenue to enhance the electrochemical performance and unlock versatile applications in cutting&#8208;edge energy storage devices. Herein, we propose a methodology that involves anionic chemistry of carbonate anions to tailor the electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction reactions of bismuth (Bi) electrodes, where the conversion energy barrier for Bi (0) to Bi (III) has been significantly reduced, endowing anionic full batteries with enhanced electrochemical kinetics and chemical self&#8208;charging property. The elaborately designed batteries with an air&#8208;switch demonstrate rapid self&#8208;recharging capabilities, recovering over 80&#8201;% of the electrochemical full charging capacity within a remarkably short timeframe of 1&#8197;hour and achieving a cumulative self&#8208;charging capacity of 5&#8197;Ah&#8201;g&#8722;1. The aqueous self&#8208;charging battery strategy induced by carbonate anion, as proposed in this study, holds the potential for extending to various anionic systems, including seawater&#8208;based Cl&#8722; ion batteries. This work offers a universal framework for advancing next&#8208;generation multi&#8208;functional power sources.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pt nanoparticles are incorporated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with engineered thioether groups on the pore walls, enabling tailored Pt electronic states and accessible Pt sites. Significantly, the optimized Pt@COF&#8208;S0.5 with electron&#8208;deficient Pt NPs in ~1&#8197;nm sizes and high accessible Pt sites exhibit excellent activity and almost absolute selectivity to targeted p&#8208;chloroaniline in the hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene.







Abstract
While supported metal nanoparticles (NPs) have shown significant promise in heterogeneous catalysis, precise control over their interaction with the support, which profoundly impacts their catalytic performance, remains a significant challenge. In this study, Pt NPs are incorporated into thioether&#8208;functionalized covalent organic frameworks (denoted COF&#8208;Sx), enabling precise control over the size and electronic state of Pt NPs by adjusting the thioether density dangling on the COF pore walls. Notably, the resulting Pt@COF&#8208;Sx demonstrate exceptional selectivity (&gt; 99&#8201;%) in catalytic hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene to p&#8208;chloroaniline, in sharp contrast to the poor selectivity of Pt NPs embedded in thioether&#8208;free COFs. Furthermore, the conversion over Pt@COF&#8208;Sx exhibits a volcano&#8208;type curve as the thioether density increases, due to the corresponding change of accessible Pt sites. This work provides an effective approach to regulating the catalysis of metal NPs via their microenvironment modulation, with the aid of rational design and precise tailoring of support structure.

         <title>Functional Group&#8208;Driven Competing Mechanism in Electrochemical Reaction and Adsorption/Desorption Processes toward High&#8208;Capacity Aluminum&#8208;Porphyrin Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Porphyrin derivatives introduced by electron&#8208;donating groups (EDG) and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) present the effect of functional groups on varying the electronic structure of porphyrin derivatives, which changes the redox potential and electrochemical energy storage performance. EWG can increase redox potential, while EDG reduces the redox potential. Due to the increasing electron density, EDG can improve Faradaic electrochemical reaction and de/adsorption capacitance contribution of porphyrin macrocycle, which is beneficial to improve the energy storage.







Abstract
Nonaqueous organic aluminum batteries are considered as promising high&#8208;safety energy storage devices due to stable ionic liquid electrolytes and Al metals. However, the stability and capacity of organic positive electrodes are limited by their inherent high solubility and low active organic molecules. To address such issues, here porphyrin compounds with rigid molecular structures present stable and reversible capability in electrochemically storing AlCl2+. Comparison between the porphyrin molecules with electron&#8208;donating groups (TPP&#8208;EDG) and with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (TPP&#8208;EWG) suggests that EDG is responsible for increasing both highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, resulting in decreased redox potentials. On the other hand, EWG is associated with decreasing both HOMO and LUMO energy levels, leading to promoted redox potentials. EDG and EWG play critical roles in regulating electron density of porphyrin &#960; bond and electrochemical energy storage kinetics behavior. The competitive mechanism between electrochemical redox reaction and de/adsorption processes suggests that TPP&#8208;OCH3 delivers the highest specific capacity ~171.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, approaching a record in the organic Al batteries.

         <title>Variation of Chemical Microenvironment of Pores in Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A side&#8208;chain engineering approach is proposed to elucidate the impact of pore chemical microenvironment variation on photocatalytic H2O2 production behavior of two hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Comparatively, COF&#8722;O features impeded charge recombination, lowered charge transfer resistance, accelerated interfacial electron transfer and additional reactive sites, leading to an impressive apparent quantum yield of 10.3&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 is an advantageous and ecologically sustainable alternative to the conventional anthraquinone process. However, achieving high conversion efficiency without sacrificial agents remains a challenge. In this study, two covalent organic frameworks (COF&#8722;O and COF&#8722;C) were prepared with identical skeletal structures but with their pore walls anchored to different alkyl chains. They were used to investigate the effect of the chemical microenvironment of pores on photocatalytic H2O2 production. Experimental results reveal a change of hydrophilicity in COF&#8722;O, leading to suppressed charge recombination, diminished charge transfer resistance, and accelerated interfacial electron transfer. An apparent quantum yield as high as 10.3&#8201;% (&#955;=420&#8197;nm) can be achieved with H2O and O2 through oxygen reduction reaction. This is among the highest ever reported for polymer photocatalysts. This study may provide a novel avenue for optimizing photocatalytic activity and selectivity in H2O2 generation.

The forest , a valuable source for the development of sustainable photosensitizers, essentially improves the technological potential of photo&#8208;ATRP and free radical polymerization. In their Research Article (e202402915), Shujun Li, Zhijun Chen, Bernd Strehmel et&#8197;al. demonstrate the performance of a new material, produced by confinement of cellulose&#8208;based carbon dots, that operates as a long afterglow emitter in the second timeframe and as photocatalyst in radical photopolymerization. Their use in a photo&#8208;ATRP cocktail results in block copolymers.

Supramolecular hetero&#8208;self&#8208;assembly is more challenging and meaningful compared to homo&#8208;self&#8208;assembly in many areas. In their Research Article (e202410130), Xu&#8208;Man Chen, Hong Yang, Quan Li et&#8197;al. present a cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated heterodimerization, which enables the occurrence of a rare cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated [2+2] heterocycloaddition under UV irradiation. The final product is found to be an unexpected [2]rotaxane, developing into a novel photochemical template synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules.

         <title>Back Cover: Electrochemical Monitoring of Real&#8208;Time Vesicle Dynamics Induced by Tau in a Confined Nanopipette (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 39/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synapse&#8208;mimicking nanopipette method was developed to electrochemically monitor single vesicle dynamics induced by lipid&#8208;tau interactions. To mimic the lipid environment in synapses, model vesicles and a modified lipid layer were confined within a nanopipette, as reported by Ru&#8208;Jia Yu, Yi&#8208;Tao Long et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202406677). Characteristic ionic current oscillations were recorded and could be used to evaluate the binding affinity of tau protein, indicating that phosphorylated tau inhibits vesicle dynamics through strong interactions with synaptic vesicles.

This paper provides a comprehensively review of nanozymes targeting organic substrates, discusses the strategies for efficient identification of new nanozymes, and proposes a novel paradigm for constructing nano&#8208;organelles.







Abstract
Since the discovery of the first peroxidase nanozyme (Fe3O4), numerous nanomaterials have been reported to exhibit intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like activity toward inorganic oxygen species, such as H2O2, oxygen, and O2&#8722;. However, the exploration of nanozymes targeting organic compounds holds transformative potential in the realm of industrial synthesis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the diverse types of nanozymes that catalyze reactions involving organic substrates and discusses their catalytic mechanisms, structure&#8208;activity relationships, and methodological paradigms for discovering new nanozymes. Additionally, we propose a forward&#8208;looking perspective on designing nanozyme formulations to mimic subcellular organelles, such as chloroplasts, termed &#8220;nano&#8208;organelles&#8221;. Finally, we analyze the challenges encountered in nanozyme synthesis, characterization, nano&#8208;organelle construction and applications while suggesting directions to overcome these obstacles and enhance nanozyme research in the future. Through this review, our goal is to inspire further research efforts and catalyze advancements in the field of nanozymes, fostering new insights and opportunities in chemical synthesis.

         <title>Coupled Electron&#8208; and Ion&#8208;Transfer Processes at a Liquid/Liquid Interface Decorated with Photoactive Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron transfer and ion transfer reactions at self&#8208;assembled BiVO4 particles at a liquid&#8208;liquid interface could be disentangled by the combined use of micropipettes and microelectrodes to detect the products. The rates of all processes could be modulated by an external Galvani potential difference across the liquid&#8208;liquid interface.







Abstract
The influence of the ion transfer on photoinduced electron transfer (ET) reactions was studied on the surface of hyperbranched semiconducting BiVO4 particles spontaneously adsorbed at the liquid&#8208;liquid (L/L) interface between an aqueous LiCl solution and bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene) ammonium tetrakis(pentaflurophenyl)borate (BATB) in 1,2&#8208;dichlorethane. The organic electrolyte was supplemented with [Co(bpy)3](PF6)3 to accept photoexcited electrons from BiVO4 under formation of the corresponding Co(II) complex. The L/L interface was stabilized at the orifice of a micropipette (MP) and allowed to record ion transfer cyclic voltammetry (ITCV) by applying a Galvani potential difference

         <title>Electrochemical Monitoring of Real&#8208;Time Vesicle Dynamics Induced by Tau in a Confined Nanopipette</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a synapse&#8208;mimicking nanopipette method to electrochemically monitor single vesicle dynamics induced by lipid&#8208;tau interactions. Characteristic ionic current oscillations have been used to evaluate the binding affinity, indicating that phosphorylated tau inhibits vesicle dynamics through strong interactions with synaptic vesicles. This finding sheds light on the mechanism of vesicle&#8208;mediated tau spreading and tau pathology.







Abstract
The microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau participates in neurotransmission regulation via its interaction with synaptic vesicles (SVs). The precise nature and mechanics of tau&#8216;s engagement with SVs, especially regarding alterations in vesicle dynamics, remain a matter of discussion. We report an electrochemical method using a synapse&#8208;mimicking nanopipette to monitor vesicle dynamics induced by tau. A model vesicle of ~30&#8197;nm is confined within a lipid&#8208;modified nanopipette orifice with a comparable diameter to mimic the synaptic lipid environment. Both tau and phosphorylated tau (p&#8208;tau) present two&#8208;state dynamic behavior in this biomimetic system, showing typical ionic current oscillation, induced by lipid&#8208;tau interaction. The results indicate that p&#8208;tau has a stronger affinity to the lipid vesicles in the confined environment, blocking the vesicle movement to a higher degree. Taken together, this method bridges a gap for sensing synaptic vesicle dynamics in a confined lipid environment, mimicking vesicle movement near the synaptic membrane. These findings contribute to understanding how different types of tau protein regulate synaptic vesicle motility and to underlying its functional and pathological behaviours in disease.

         <title>Stochastic Sensing of Chloride Anions Using an &#945;&#8208;Hemolysin Pore with a semiaza&#8208;Bambusuril Adapter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stochastic sensing of chloride anions has been developed by employing a semiaza&#8208;bambusuril (BU) as a non&#8208;covalent molecular adapter inside the &#946; barrel of the &#945;&#8208;hemolysin pore. When the chloride receptor blocks the protein pore, it inhibits the ionic current through the pore, providing a single&#8208;molecule sensing technology and concomitantly allowing detection of its chloride guest. The kinetic parameters are deduced from the single&#8208;channel recordings in the absence and presence of chloride anions.







Abstract
Pores containing molecular adapters provide internal selective binding sites, thereby allowing the stochastic sensing of analytes. Herein, we demonstrate that semiaza&#8208;bambusuril (BU) acts as a non&#8208;covalent molecular adapter when lodged within the lumen of the wild&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;hemolysin (WT&#8208;&#945;HL) protein pore. Because the bambusurils are recognized as anion receptors, the anion binding site within the adapter&#8208;nanopore complex allows the detection of chloride anions, thus converting a non&#8208;selective pore into an anion sensor.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexadienes by Birch Reduction in the Presence of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complete change in regioselectivity has been observed during the Birch reduction of benzoic acids in the presence of carbonyl compounds. Alkyl aldehydes afford exclusively 1,4&#8208;isomers, whereas with ketones and aryl aldehydes, 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes are isolated in good yields on a large scale.

Birch reductions are well&#8208;known transformations of arenes, applied for large scale synthesis of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes. Herein, we describe first reactions of benzoic acids in the presence of carbonyl compounds, affording aldol products in moderate to high yields. Alkyl aldehydes give the expected nonconjugated dienes by reaction at the &#945;&#8208;position. Interestingly, the intermediately formed enolate attacks aryl aldehydes and ketones from its &#947;&#8208;position, which can be explained by steric hindrance. This opens the door for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes, which are not accessible by classical Birch reductions. Our method is applicable to benzoic, m&#8208; and p&#8208;toluic acid and various carbonyl compounds, and more than 25 new products were isolated in up to 93&#8201;% yield. Prochiral aryl aldehydes afford diastereomeric mixtures in ratios of about 4&#8201;:&#8201;1, but in the cyclohexadiene ring only trans isomers are formed with high selectivity. Finally, the 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes are suitable precursors for further transformations, which we have demonstrated in first examples. Thus, aromatization affords products of a formal meta selective Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation, and four new stereocenters were generated by cycloaddition of singlet oxygen with excellent selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;A complete change in regioselectivity has been observed during the Birch reduction of benzoic acids in the presence of carbonyl compounds. Alkyl aldehydes afford exclusively 1,4-isomers, whereas with ketones and aryl aldehydes, 1,3-cyclohexadienes are isolated in good yields on a large scale. Such compounds are suitable precursors for further transformations.

         <title>Exploiting trans&#8208;Sulfinylation for the Synthesis of Diverse N&#8208;Alkyl Sulfinamides via Decarboxylative Sulfinamidation</title>

         <dc:description>
Trans&#8208;sulfinylation enables the generation of hydrolytically&#8208;sensitive alkyl sulfinylamines in situ from Tr&#8208;NSO and primary amines. We exploit this process alongside alkyl radical generation from carboxylic acids using acridine photocatalysis to prepare a broad selection of N&#8208;alkyl sulfinamides from structurally diverse and readily available feedstocks.







Abstract
Combining simple amines with the bench&#8208;stable sulfinylamine Tr&#8208;NSO allows in situ preparation of reactive alkyl sulfinylamines, which when combined with alkyl radicals generated by photocatalytic decarboxylation, provides N&#8208;alkyl sulfinamides. The reactions are broad in scope and tolerate a wide variety of functional groups on both the acid and amine components. The sulfinamide products are used to prepare a selection of challenging S(VI) products. The method provides a convenient way to use reactive and unstable alkyl sulfinylamines.

         <title>Deuteration as a General Strategy to Enhance Azobenzene&#8208;Based Photopharmacology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isotope effects have been explored for decades and now find entrance into photopharmacology. Simple deuteration of azobenzene photoswitches improves photoswitching quantum yield and macroscopic switching kinetics. This finding is translated to the faster optical control of big potassium ion channels and G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, important players for synaptic transmission and neural communication.







Abstract
Chemical photoswitches have become a widely used approach for the remote control of biological functions with spatiotemporal precision. Several molecular scaffolds have been implemented to improve photoswitch characteristics, ranging from the nature of the photoswitch itself (e.g. azobenzenes, dithienylethenes, hemithioindigo) to fine&#8208;tuning of aromatic units and substituents. Herein, we present deuterated azobenzene photoswitches as a general means of enhancing the performance of photopharmacological molecules. Deuteration can improve azobenzene performance in terms of light sensitivity (higher molar extinction coefficient), photoswitch efficiency (higher photoisomerization quantum yield), and photoswitch kinetics (faster macroscopic rate of photoisomerization) with minimal alteration to the underlying structure of the photopharmacological ligand. We report synthesized deuterated azobenzene&#8208;based ligands for the optimized optical control of ion channel and G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) function in live cells, setting the stage for the straightforward, widespread adoption of this approach.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Activation and Stereospecific Functionalization of Bis(boronic Esters) Derived from 2&#8208;Alkenes: Construction of Propionates and Other 1,2&#8208;Difunctional Motifs</title>

         <dc:description>
Regio&#8208; and enantioselective catalytic difunctionalization of alkenes can be accomplished by a strategy involving alkene diboration followed by site&#8208;selective activation and copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling of the less&#8208;hindered boronic ester. This process allows a broad array of difunctional chiral products to be produced from simple olefin starting materials.







Abstract
Non&#8208;directed regioselective activation of bis(boronic esters), followed by functionalization, is reported. A bulky activator is shown to selectively activate the less hindered boronic ester enabling it to undergo stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling to a variety of electrophiles. This steric&#8208;based regioselectivity provides a simple and efficient method to prepare highly functionalized, enantiomerically enriched products starting from simple alkenes.

         <dc:description>
Base&#8208;promoted halogen transfer enables direct benzylic C&#8722;H oxidative coupling reactions with alcohols. This new deprotonative C&#8722;H oxidation protocol displays unique synthetic capabilities over alternative mechanistic strategies, including the ability to activate high oxidation potential substrates, tolerance of oxidizable and nucleophilic functional groups, and precision site&#8208;selectivity for polyalkylarenes.







Abstract
We disclose a benzylic C&#8722;H oxidative coupling reaction with alcohols that proceeds through a synergistic deprotonation, halogenation and substitution sequence. The combination of tert&#8208;butoxide bases with 2&#8208;halothiophene halogen oxidants enables the first general protocol for generating and using benzyl halides through a deprotonative pathway. In contrast to existing radical&#8208;based methods for C&#8722;H functionalization, this process is guided by C&#8722;H acidity trends. This gives rise to new synthetic capabilities, including the ability to functionalize diverse methyl(hetero)arenes, tolerance of oxidizable and nucleophilic functional groups, precision site&#8208;selectivity for polyalkylarenes and use of a double C&#8722;H etherification process to controllably oxidize methylarenes to benzaldehydes.

         <title>Spontaneous Molecular Bromine Production in Sea&#8208;Salt Aerosols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mechanism for the activation of bromide ions (Br&#8722;) by O2 and H2O without additional potent oxidants is proposed. Under acidic conditions, Br&#8722;, O2 and H3O+ can spontaneously generate Br and HO2 radicals through a proton&#8211;electron transfer process at the air&#8211;water interface and in the liquid phase. Light can promote this process significantly and promote the release of molecular bromine into the gas phase.







Abstract
Bromine chemistry is responsible for the catalytic ozone destruction in the atmosphere. The heterogeneous reactions of sea&#8208;salt aerosols are the main abiotic sources of reactive bromine in the atmosphere. Here, we present a novel mechanism for the activation of bromide ions (Br&#8722;) by O2 and H2O in the absence of additional oxidants. The laboratory and theoretical calculation results demonstrated that under dark conditions, Br&#8722;, O2 and H3O+ could spontaneously generate Br and HO2 radicals through a proton&#8211;electron transfer process at the air&#8211;water interface and in the liquid phase. Our results also showed that light and acidity could significantly promote the activation of Br&#8722; and the production of Br2. The estimated gaseous Br2 production rate was up to 1.55&#215;1010&#8201;molecules&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 under light and acidic conditions; these results showed a significant contribution to the atmospheric reactive bromine budget. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during Br&#8722; activation could promote the multiphase oxidation of SO2 to produce sulfuric acid, while the increase in acidity had a positive feedback effect on Br&#8722; activation. Our findings highlight the crucial role of the proton&#8208;electron transfer process in Br2 production; here, H3O+ facilitates the activation of Br&#8722; by O2, serves as a significant source of atmospheric reactive bromine and exerts a profound impact on the atmospheric oxidation capacity.

&lt;p&gt;A novel mechanism for the activation of bromide ions (Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O without additional potent oxidants is proposed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bromine chemistry is responsible for the catalytic ozone destruction in the atmosphere. The heterogeneous reactions of sea-salt aerosols are the main abiotic sources of reactive bromine in the atmosphere. Here, we present a novel mechanism for the activation of bromide ions (Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in the absence of additional oxidants. The laboratory and theoretical calculation results demonstrated that under dark conditions, Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; could spontaneously generate Br and HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; radicals through a proton&#8211;electron transfer process at the air&#8211;water interface and in the liquid phase. Our results also showed that light and acidity could significantly promote the activation of Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and the production of Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The estimated gaseous Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate was up to 1.55&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;molecules&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under light and acidic conditions; these results showed a significant contribution to the atmospheric reactive bromine budget.

         <title>Photochemically Driven Peptide Formation in Supersaturated Aerosol Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of amide bonds between amino acids in supersaturated aerosol droplets is shown to be possible in the presence of dicyandiamide, a potential prebiotic compound, and intense visible light. The rate of this photochemical reaction is strongly dependent on the microdroplet radius.







Abstract
The condensation of amino acids into peptides plays a crucial role in protein synthesis and is thus essential for understanding the origins of life. However, the spontaneous formation of peptides from amino acids in bulk aqueous media is energetically unfavorable, posing a challenge for elucidating plausible abiotic mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the formation of amide bonds between amino acids within highly supersaturated aerosol droplets containing dicyandiamide (DCD), a cyanide derivative potentially present on primordial Earth. Metastable states, i.e. supersaturation, within individual micron&#8208;sized droplets are studied using both an optical trap and a linear quadrupole electrodynamic balance. When irradiated with intense visible light, amide bond formation is observed to occur and can be monitored using vibrational bands in Raman spectra. The reaction rate is found to be strongly influenced by droplet size and kinetic modelling suggests that it is driven by the photochemical product of a DCD self&#8208;reaction. Our results highlight the potential of atmospheric aerosol particles as reaction environments for peptide synthesis and have potential implications for the prebiotic chemistry of early Earth.

         <dc:description>
A symmetric anion mediated dynamic kinetic asymmetric Knoevenagel reaction was established as a general and efficient method for accessing both C&#8722;N and N&#8722;N atropisomers. The resulting highly enantio&#8208;pure pyridine&#8208;2,6(1H,3H)&#8208;diones exhibit diverse structures and functional groups. The mechanism investigation further revealed how the stereochemical information was transferred from the catalyst into the axially chiral products.

The resulting highly enantio&#8208;pure pyridine&#8208;2,6(1H,3H)&#8208;diones exhibit diverse structures and functional groups. The key to excellent regio&#8208; and remote enantiocontrol could be owed to the hydrogen bond between the enolate anion and triflamide block of the organocatalyst. This connected the enolate anion and iminium cation by a chiral backbone. The mechanism investigation via control experiments, correlation analysis, and density functional theory calculations further revealed how the stereochemical information was transferred from the catalyst into the axially chiral pyridine&#8208;2,6(1H,3H)&#8208;diones. The synthetic applications also demonstrated the reaction's potential.

         <dc:description>
A seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring phosphepinium has been developed as the key core skeleton for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. The low&#8208;lying px orbital in the phosphonium moiety and the bent conformation of the seven&#8208;membered ring lead to a stabilization of the LUMO via a &#8220;px&#8211;&#960;* conjugation&#8221;. The observed intense emission with a large Stokes shift was attributed to a large structural relaxation with a contribution from a quinoidal resonance structure in the excited state.







Abstract
Positively charged phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles are characteristic core skeletons for functional molecules. While various phosphonium&#8208;containing five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring compounds have been reported, the seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring phosphepinium have not been fully studied yet. In this study, dithieno[3,2&#8208;b;&#8201;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]phosphepinium ions containing electron&#8208;donating aminophenyl groups were synthesized. An X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the resulting donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor dyes revealed a bent conformation of the central seven&#8208;membered ring. These compounds exhibit fluorescence in the near&#8208;infrared region with a bathochromic shift of ca. 70&#8197;nm compared to a phosphepine oxide congener and a large Stokes shift. High fluorescence quantum yields were obtained even in polar solvents due to the suppression of the nonradiative decay process. A theoretical study revealed that the phosphepinium skeleton is highly electron&#8208;accepting owing to the orbital interaction between a px orbital of the phosphonium moiety and a &#960;* orbital of the 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene moiety. Due to the lower&#8208;lying px orbital in the phosphonium moiety compared to that of the phosphine oxide and the bent conformation of the seven&#8208;membered ring, the phosphepinium ring permits effective px&#8211;&#960;* conjugation. A large structural relaxation with a contribution of a quinoidal resonance structure is suggested in the excited state, which should be responsible for the bright emission with a large Stokes shift.

         <title>BioLindlar Catalyst: Ene&#8208;Reductase&#8208;Promoted Selective Bioreduction of Cyanoalkynes to Give (Z)&#8208;Cyanoalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynes are attractive starting materials owing to the wide range of possible chemical transformations of this functional group. The selective bioreduction of electron&#8208;poor alkynes catalysed by ene&#8208;reductases to give (Z)&#8208; or (E)&#8208;alkenes is now reported. Preparative biotransformations were performed with total selectivity to give the (Z)&#8208;cyanoalkenes (isolated in 63&#8211;97&#8201;%&#8201;yield), thus resembling the activity shown by transition&#8208;metal (e.g. Lindlar) catalysts.







Abstract
The direct synthesis of alkenes from alkynes usually requires the use of transition&#8208;metal catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Alkynes are attractive starting materials owing to the wide range of possible chemical transformations of this functional group. The selective bioreduction of electron-poor alkynes catalysed by ene-reductases to give (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)- or (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-alkenes is now reported. Preparative biotransformations were performed with total selectivity to give the (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-cyanoalkenes (isolated in 63&#8211;97&#8201;%&#8201;yield), thus resembling the activity shown by transition-metal (e.g. Lindlar) catalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direct synthesis of alkenes from alkynes usually requires the use of transition-metal catalysts. Unfortunately, efficient biocatalytic alternatives for this transformation have yet to be discovered. Herein, the selective bioreduction of electron-deficient alkynes to alkenes catalysed by ene-reductases (EREDs) is described. Alkynes bearing ketone, aldehyde, ester, and nitrile moieties have been effectively reduced with excellent conversions and stereoselectivities, observing clear trends for the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; ratios depending on the nature of the electron-withdrawing group. In the case of cyanoalkynes, (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-alkenes were obtained as the major product, and the reaction scope was expanded to a wide variety of aromatic substrates (up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;% conversion, and &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; stereoselectivities of up to &amp;gt;99/1). Other alkynes containing aldehyde, ketone, or ester functionalities also proved to be excellent substrates, and interestingly gave the corresponding (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-alkenes. Preparative biotransformations were performed on a 0.4&#8197;mmol scale, producing the desired (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-cyanoalkenes with good to excellent isolated yields (63&#8211;97&#8201;%).

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Calix[4]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein a subsequent cyclization/oxidation process to access inherently chiral calix[4]arenes in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Both the large&#8208;scale synthesis and synthetic transformation of calix[4]arene&#8208;based chiral catalysts have demonstrated their potential applications.







Abstract
Inherently chiral calix[4]arenes are an excellent structural scaffold for enantioselective synthesis, chiral recognition, sensing, and circularly polarized luminescence. However, their catalytic enantioselective synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arene derivatives via cascade enantioselective cyclization and oxidation reactions. The three&#8208;component reaction features a broad substrate scope (33&#8197;examples), high efficiency (up to 90&#8201;% yield), and excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%&#8201;ee on average). The potential applications of calix[4]arene derivatives are highlighted by their synthetic transformation and a detailed investigation of their photophysical and chiroptical properties.

         <title>Electrophilic C(sp2)&#8722;H Cyanation with Inorganic Cyanate (OCN&#8722;) by PIII/PV=O&#8208;Catalyzed Phase Transfer Activation</title>

An organophosphorus&#8208;catalyzed method for the direct electrophilic cyanation of C(sp2)&#8722;H nucleophiles using inorganic sodium cyanate (NaOCN) is reported. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deoxyfunctionalization of insoluble inorganic salts by PIII/PV=O catalyzed phase transfer activation.







Abstract
An organophosphorus &#8208;catalyzed method for the direct electrophilic cyanation of C(sp2)&#8722;H nucleophiles with sodium cyanate (NaOCN) is reported. The catalytic deoxyfunctionalization of the OCN&#8722; anion is enabled by the use of a small&#8208;ring phosphacyclic (phosphetane) catalyst in combination with a terminal hydrosilane O&#8208;atom acceptor and a malonate&#8208;derived bromenium donor. In situ spectroscopy under single&#8208;turnover conditions demonstrate that insoluble inorganic cyanate anion is activated by bromide displacement on a bromophosphonium catalytic intermediate to give a reactive N&#8208;bound isocyanatophosphonium ion, which delivers electrophilic &#8220;CN+&#8221; equivalents to nucleophilic (hetero)arenes and alkenes with loss of a phosphine oxide. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deoxyfunctionalization of insoluble inorganic salts by PIII/PV=O catalyzed phase transfer activation.
